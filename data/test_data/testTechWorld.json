    "title": "UK AI startups to watch: the hottest machine learning startups in the UK",
    "content": "It's official, 2016 was the year of the AI startup acquisition. Tech giants Apple, Intel, Twitter and Microsoft have all spent large sums to bring artificial intelligence startups, and their expertise, inhouse.Four of the biggest AI startup acquisitions of the last five years have come from the UK, starting with Google's purchase of Deep Mind in 2014 for a reported PS400 million. Since then Apple has purchased Cambridge-based natural language processing specialists VocalIQ, Microsoft bought the machine learning powered keyboard SwiftKey in February and Twitter acquired Entrepreneur First alumni Magic Pony in June.Here are some of the most interesting startups working in the area of artificial intelligence in the UK today, whether that is machine learning, deep learning, neural nets or computer vision. Could the next Deep Mind be lurking in there?The established security startup from Cambridge, Darktrace, uses machine learning algorithms to spot patterns and catch cyber criminals before they can hit. Cyber threats are created at a rate too fast for security companies to keep up to date, so smart use of machine learning allows Darktrace to, in theory, stay ahead of the criminals. Darktrace uses AI techniques to learn what is normal within a company's network so that it can quickly identify anomalies. According to its website: \"This allows it to detect cyber attacks of a nature that may not have been observed before, the unknown unknowns.\" Darktrace CEO Nicole Eagan told Techworld in 2014: \"People are finally accepting that compromises are happening, regardless of how much perimeter security and malware detection software they've put in.\" Darktrace raised a massive $65 million (PS51 million) investment round led by investment firm KKR in July. BenevolentAI is a UK startup focused on bringing the power of AI and machine learning to the genomics space. The idea is to expedite the traditional research process by ingesting huge amounts of data and literature using proprietary algorithms and NVIDIA's DGX-1 deep learning supercomputer. BenevolentAI then builds tools on top to match the workflow of drug discovery scientists so that they can easily mine and interrogate the data, ideally reducing the time to market for important drugs.  BenevolentAI is one of the best funded AI startups in the UK, bringing in a massive Series A round of PS72 million in a single undisclosed round. London startup Onfido is doing similar work to Darktrace but with identity and background checks. Founded by a trio of Oxford graduates, the platform plugs into various publicly available databases to give employers quick identity verification and background checks for things like driving and criminal records.  In their own words, Onfido's \"intelligent software revolutionises the archaic background checking industry through automated data aggregation and verification\". The company is hiring machine learning and computer vision engineers to build on the smart platform. Onfido raised a strong Series B funding round of $25 million (PS19 million) in April, led by Idinvest Partners. London-based startup Digital Genius is targeting the contact centre with its deep learning technology. The Digital Genius neural network helps agents respond to common customer service queries quicker by first automatically sorting and labelling the metadata and then generating three potential responses, each with a level of certainty attached. Organisations can then set a threshold for automation, so responses the system views as 90 percent accurate could be automatically sent out - like a chatbot - and anything below is sent to the agent to review, for example. The startup claims it can reduce the average handling time for cases by 20 percent. This is especially important as organisations receive queries from more and more digital channels, including social media. Digital Genius's intelligence layer integrates with existing enterprise contact centre software - including Zendesk, Salesforce and Microsoft - so no need to rip and replace existing systems.  The startup has raised $9.85 million (PS8 million) in funding to date from investors including Salesforce Ventures, Bloomberg Beta and Lumia Capital and has a US office in San Francisco. Customers include the Dutch airline KLM, Unilever and L'Oreal. Echobox is building AI for the publishing industry, and claims to have developed \"the world's first artificial intelligence that understands the meaning of content\". Founder Antoine Amann is a Cambridge graduate who worked in publishing with the Financial Times and developed Echobox while at Entrepreneur First in 2013.  Amann wrote in a blog post that Echobox has \"developed an AI platform that takes a large quantity of variables into account and analyses them in real time to determine optimum post performance\". Echobox social is a predictive tool which optimises content for social media, which the startup claims to double referrals from Facebook and Twitter, without having to do your own analytics, A/B testing or content curation. Basically: RIP social media editors. It has worked with the likes of Vice and The Telegraph in the UK media. Echobox raised $3.4 million (PS2.7 million) Series A funding round in July led by Mangrove Capital Partners. Ravelin is the brain child of former Hailo employees who saw that existing anti-fraud technology wasn't fit for the on-demand market. Its machine-learning algorithms are integrated with customer data to give a contextual basis for detecting potentially fraudulent transactions.  COO Nick Lally told Techworld that where rival payment gateways like Stripe analyse transactions, \"we analyse customers\". Lally says there is no cold start problem with its machine learning models, \"when they integrate against our APIs we ask them to backfill data and chargebacks to inspect that and train a model on those. So from day one they get great results\", he said. Ravelin launched commercially nine months, with early customers including Deliveroo and EasyTaxi. It raised PS3 million in October, led by Playfair Capital and included Amadeus Capital and Passion Capital. Stepsize is a startup working on AI to help software developers.  Their first product, Stepsize Layer, is a desktop application for developers that automatically adds context to code bases, so developers have a better view of who wrote a piece of code, when, and why. They do this by pulling together commits, code reviews and user stories to create a timeline for that code. It integrates with Slack so developers can contact the author and ask questions about the code. Three of the co-founders are UCL mathematics graduates, with Matthieu Louis and Nick Omeyer specialising in machine learning for their masters. The team are currently working on pooling data to build and train machine learning algorithms to help software developers. Stepsize is part of the Virgin Media Accelerator Programme. London-based startup Phrasee is aiming its artificial intelligence systems at the marketing sector, using natural language processing techniques to optimise digital marketing messages. As its website states: \"Out of trillions of ways to write something, what are the odds your gut instinct gets it right? The answer: next to none.\" Phrasee integrates with major email service providers and will optimises subject lines and copy to increase open rates. The startup also offers software which prompts marketers to make better calls to action based on the data. The AI engine simulates millions of permutations of copy and makes a prediction based on historic results about what will perform best. This is then fed back into the engine so that it gets better the more you use it. Phrasee raised PS1 million in seed funding led by communications business Next 15, which owns a range of marketing agencies. Grip is the London based startup that is using AI to make networking at events more productive. The startup, formerly known as Networkr, was rebranded in April because, as CEO Tim Groot told Techworld: \"People don't like networking, so we wanted a name open to interpretation.\" Grip collects data from social accounts (LinkedIn, Twitter) and registration data to act as a smart matchmaking service - using a swipe interface - for corporate event goers. Think 'Tinder for networking'. Grip will then deliver a report back to the event organiser to identify how successful the event has been for every user or social segment. Groot told Techworld that the average Grip user made 300 swipes during the Cannes Lions advertising festival this year. When it comes to the AI, Groot says hiring talent to join their engineers in Copenhagen wasn't difficult and that \"matching people in professional setting is an exciting problem to be thinking about\" for their engineers. Grip merged with fellow professional networking startup Intros.at in 2015 and is seeking a funding round later this year. Groot says the company is making revenue from events already, and is working with the likes of Reed Exhibitions and Cannes Lions. Seldon is an AI startup focusing on bringing machine learning capabilities into the enterprise. Seldon creates tools that help data scientists derive value from big data within an organisation quicker, namely processing data and creating algorithms and models.   The platform has two main functions: recommendations and predictions. For recommendations the open source platform captures and logs user actions via an API delivers recommendations based on your models. For predictions Seldon claims it can predict what products a customer is likely to buy so that sales teams can build supervised, learning-based predictive models and pipelines. Seldon.io already works with YouGov, Lastminute.com and RatedPeople.com. and is based out of the Barclays incubator in London. It has raised two undisclosed funding rounds from Techstars. Based in south London, Tractable is an enterprise deep learning consultancy focused on automating tasks that were previously considered too expert for an AI to perform. The website reads: \"Our AI technology combines image recognition and text understanding to interpret unstructured and specialist data, as domain experts do. If your business relies on expert visual analysis or language understanding, our AI can bring drastic performance gains.\" Tractable offers bespoke deep learning solutions depending on its clients requirements, and has built an automated audit claims product for the insurance industry. The team is led by Alex Dalyac, a computer science postgraduate from Imperial College London and Razvan Ranca, a computer science postgrad from Cambridge University. Tractable raised $1.9 million (PS1.4 million) in June last year, led by Zetta Venture Partners. re:infer is currently in private beta, working with companies like ecommerce startup Farfetch. The technology uses deep neural networks in its AI bots that can process and respond to customer queries in natural language. The re:infer platform also pulls all forms of user feedback - email, surveys, social media - into one place and applies AI to make sense of the data. Re:infer is also looking into ways to allow customers to use these chatbots to do their shopping. The founders met while studying in the AI research group at UCL, the same university that the Deep Mind founder Demis Hassabis got his PhD from. re:infer received PS65,000 in funding from the Seedcamp incubator it is currently based out of the Seedcamp incubator in London. The intelligent assistant Cleo's main function is to help you be smarter with your money. It has been developed by computer science graduates Barney Hussey-Yeo and Aleksandra Wozniak, who met as members of Entrepreneur First's fifth cohort.  Cleo works via a messaging platform which, once you give it permission to your account information, can answer questions about your finances. Using deep learning techniques allows Cleo to learn and adapt to your habits and preferences. As the website states: \"Imagine if you had your own team of McKinsey consultants, Goldman Sachs associates and hedge fund analysts whose sole job is to advise you on your money.\" This UK insurtech startup that is in the current Entrepreneur First cohort is building an AI enable insurance adviser. The app says it will be able to inform you if you are under or over insured, if you have duplicate or missing cover and can help you find better cover. You sign up once and then getting new cover only takes one tap. Brolly also acts as a mobile wallet for all of your insurance products, including documents, to be managed in one place. Brolly is currently in beta and says it will launch on iOS and Android in 2016. Another Entrepreneur First alumni, StatusToday collects the metadata created whenever someone within an organisation takes an action on their computer. It then applies machine learning to spot user behaviour patterns. This could help flag anomalies, which could mean an internal breach has occurred, as well as tracking employee productivity and communications. StatusToday raised a $1.3 million (PS1 million) seed funding round in February 2016 from a range of UK venture capital firms (Notion Capital, LocalGlobe, Force over Mass Capital, Entrepreneur First) and several angel investors. New York-based startup Agolo uses artificial intelligence to create real-time summaries of information. Founded in 2012, it was initially created to curate Twitter feeds in order to focus on conversations, tweets and hashtags that were most relevant to its user's preferences. More recently, Agolo has closed a $3.5 million (PS2.7 million) round of funding including investment from Microsoft's corporate investment fund, Microsoft Ventures, among others. Using natural language processing, Agolo scans content, identifies relationships among the information sources, and picks out the most relevant information, all leading to a comprehensive summary of the original piece of information. Developed in Berkeley, California, Bonsai creates software that enables automated management of machine learning algorithms and libraries. Like Agolo, it too announced a new investment of $7.6 million (PS5.8 million), from Microsoft Ventures, along with New Enterprise Associates.  Interestingly, Bonsai's AI framework is based on TensorFlow, a Google-owned machine learning platform and a competitor to Microsoft's CNTK, an open source deep-learning toolkit.  ",

    "title": "14 UK insurtech startups to watch: from peer-to-peer and by-the-hour insurance, to back office tools for insurers",
    "content": "Speaking back in April, Andrew Brem, chief digital officer at insurance group Aviva admitted the insurance industry is \"not known for its incredible radicalism\".However, by embracing the UK's quickly growing pool of insurance technology (insurtech) startups, as well as development of mobile apps, investing in digital channels, hiring tech talent and analysing customer data, the UK insurance industry is finally moving into the digital age.Head of digital innovation at Aviva, Paul Heybourne, told Techworld: \"VCs are buzzing with [insurtech] a lot more than they were a few years ago with fintech and payments. Still, we are yet to see any true disruption, so perhaps that is why we are at the top of hype cycle, but it's only a matter of time.\"Recent research from London accelerator Startupbootcamp InsurTech and PwC, based on more than 1,300 startups across the world, shows that 75 percent of incumbent insurers \"believe the biggest impact to the industry will come from building new products in order to address the changing needs of the customer\".Here are some of the most innovative insurtech startups in the UK trying to build those products today:The very British sounding hourly car insurance startup Cuvva was set up in 2014. In the mobile app you simply enter the registration number and approximate value of the car you are borrowing from a friend or family member, choose the time you want to be covered for, take a picture of the car and Cuvva will get you an instant quote. Cuvva integrates with Facebook so that you can see which of your friends have cars to borrow. Cuvva queries various data sources to check driving licence data (The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's MyLicence scheme), the Claims and Underwriting Exchange and automated fraud protection to verify coverage quicker than legacy players can. Cuvva is based in the Barclays accelerator in London and raised a PS1.5 million seed round led by LocalGlobe in January 2017, bringing its total funding to nearly PS2 million. InMyBag was founded by former head of digital at insurer Zurich, Iain Harper. The idea for the startup came out of some research done by venture capitalist firm Hambro Perks that showed a gap in the insurance market for mobile workers who are reliant on their technology. Aimed at mobile workers, InMyBag insures devices like laptops, phones and cameras. Instead of having to wait weeks for a new device InMyBag works with Amazon Prime and Apple to guarantee same day replacement of the devices by either fixing them or loaning you a device, wherever you are in the world, and will recover your data too. Harper told Techworld that InTheBag wants to \"help first and ask questions later, instead of trying to wriggle out of claims, which has led to the poor reputation of traditional gadget insurance providers\". Plans range from 'the PS1k bag', which covers devices up to a value of PS1,000 including same day resolution, worldwide cover and 1 click CrashPlan recovery for PS11.99/month to 'the custom bag' aimed at workers with lots of kit, such as photographers, for PS30.99 a month.  Brolly is a London-based startup that is uses AI technology to give customers a mobile insurance locker, advisor and shop, cutting down on costly renewals and coverage gaps. Brolly graduated from the sixth Entrepreneur First cohort in September. The mobile app has three core features: locker (stores your existing and expired policy documents), advisor (suggests coverage you may need) and shop, which is due to come online in the summer and will allow customers to purchase policies direct in the app. Brolly is building out its database and machine learning algorithms so that the app can see where you are under or over insured and suggest better deals by surveying the market. The startup that makes it easier to move house Buzzmove is leveraging its data to build a tool for contents insurance. The CEO Becky Downing told Techworld: \"The buzzmove value proposition revolves around the home and people's belongings. We're using innovative new tech to use our existing distribution channels and processes in the removals industry to collect unique and highly accurate data on what people have in their homes.\" Buzzmove is building a tool that Downing says will do for contents what telematic apps did for motor insurance which \"will provide household insurance companies with accurate insight into their customers' household contents. This means that insurance companies can better correlate their premiums to risk and provide customers with a much better deal,\" says Downing. Buzzmove raised a massive PS6 million funding round in August 2016, led by White Mountains Insurance Group. Digital Fineprint is using machine learning technology to make smart insurance policy recommendations to users which opt in to the service, based on their social media data. For example, using LinkedIn data gives a pretty good indicator of income, and Facebook can give a good indicator of a user's appetite for risk when it comes to a life insurance policy. You may well raise your eyebrows following the Admiral-Facebook disaster - where UK insurer Admiral hastily withdrew plans to use Facebook posts to set insurance rates for car owners last year, after Facebook said the scheme breached its privacy rules. However, Digital Fineprint founder Erik Abrahamsson told Techworld that it is company policy to never contravene guidelines in this way. The Oxford graduate Abrahamsson said: \"Insurers are worried about millennials being undersold or wrongly sold policies, so we present what is the right policy for someone using social media.\" Digital Fineprint is currently sat in Accenture's Fintech Innovation Lab in London and has raised PS400,000 in seed funding. Digital Risks is an insurance specialist built for tech companies, offering a flexible, pay monthly Insurance-as-a-Service model. A founder could start out by protecting their laptop and end up with employer liability insurance and insurance against data breaches as the company grows. When it comes to cyber security risk, Digital Risks wants to reach a point where, like with wearables and health insurance, it can use penetration testing to develop dynamic risk models depending on the robustness of a company's security. Digital Risks has raised PS300,000 on Angels Den and is planning another funding round soon. Neos is a London-based startup that packages together best-in-class IoT enabled hardware, 24/7 support and unlimited building and contents home insurance underwritten by Hiscox, all managed from a mobile app.  From the app, customers can look at dashboards or live camera feeds, respond to issues like an intruder alert or a leak and contact the Neos team to get a professional sent out for response. Neos raised a PS1 million seed round from investors including Eos Venture Partners. The Cambridge and London based startup Instanda could be considered the most pure play insurtech company on this list. It offers a management tool for insurers and brokers to build, launch, distribute and monitor new insurance products in a fraction of the time it would traditionally take. So what does that mean? Being tied to legacy insurance software systems means building and delivering new insurance products can be cumbersome at best. Instanda has built a tool which consolidates question sets, underwriting workflow, documentation, a rating engine and the customer journey so that underwriters can respond to changing market demands quicker than before. Instanda raised some non-equity assistance funding from the Microsoft Accelerator in March. Back Me Up is a British startup offshoot of big Belgian insurer Ageas, who they describes as \"a responsible parent who makes sure we do everything properly\". The Back Me Up insurance proposition certainly looks like it was built for the millennial consumer. For PS15 you get coverage for your three most valuable items (say: laptop, camera, bike) as well as phone screen, keys and travel insurance. You simply have to sign up and send pictures of your three items to get them covered. You can also bolt on things like landlord cover, extra items and breakdown cover. Peer-to-peer car insurance was an inevitability, and Guevara looks to be one of the best operators out there. You pay a set amount up front called your Base Price. This is worked out using your age, car, location and experience etc. You are then put into a group with similar people, where the money is pooled together to go towards the group's insurance fees. If the group keeps their claims down then the money in the pool stays there year on year, meaning you could save up to fifty percent on your renewal fee. A chatbot for insurance may sound like a bad elevator pitch, but Spixii has some pretty smart technology behind it. Spixii is an \"automated insurance agent\" which essentially lets you buy and manage your insurance through a chat interface. It is still in beta but essentially it promises the ability to ask Spixii, for example, to insure your bike, when your renewal date is and any other queries you may have when it comes to insurance. Based out of the Startupbootcamp InsurTech incubator in London, Spixii was founded by a self-described \"band of geeks\" from technical and insurance backgrounds, with cofounder Alberto Chierici coming from a data science and actuary background and Renaud Million an actuarial consultant at Ernst and Young. In terms of funding Spixii has been backed by the Startupbootcamp incubator. Blockchain specialist startup Luther Systems is working on a secret bespoke product for insurance giant Aviva around simplifying contracts. Luther promises the ability to create smart contracts using templates before securely distributing them and the receiver can even virtually sign. The insurance industry is naturally interested in how the distributed ledger technology can improve its back office processes and Luther Systems appears to be leading the way with its high profile partnership with Aviva. Little is known about the company but it is based out of the Aviva sponsored Founders Factory accelerator in London. Insly is a cloud based platform for insurance brokers. You can search and manage clients, policies, objects and payments in one place. It is cloud based, so brokers can access the system from anywhere. It is essentially a customer relationship management (CRM) platform - like Salesforce or Workday - for the insurance sector. Insly is a Startupbootcamp Fintech alumni and raised a PS850,000 funding round in January. The claims process tends to be the most painful part when it comes to motor insurance, and the startup Rightindem is trying to smooth it out by giving claims brokers self-service tools for total loss claims. Founded by automotive industry veteran David Stubbs, he claims that their IT tools and call scripting reduce the average claims leakage by over PS500 per claim for its pilot customers. The system is built on an automated vehicle valuation service, which helps claims handlers spend more time with customers and less on admin. The product is currently in private beta and is working with major UK insurer Admiral. It raised a PS500,000 seed round led by Startupbootcamp in December. ",

    "title": "Meet Neos: the insurtech startup packaging IoT sensors with home insurance policies",
    "content": "Imagine you're sitting on a white sandy beach in the Caribbean, not a worry in the world, when your phone pings you a notification: there has been a leak at home and your kitchen is slowly filling with water. It's a hypothetical situation I hear a lot when it comes to covering innovation in the insurance sector, an industry not famed for its radicalism, and one I heard again a few weeks ago while chatting to Matt Poll, CEO and founder of Insurtech startup Neos. The solution that companies like Neos aim to create is an app, combined with a whole host of internet of things (IoT) sensors and specialised hardware, which will allow you to turn the mains off remotely, get a repairman called out and make a claim, all from your phone. Poll has been on the other side of the industry, previously at RSA and its sub-brand More Than, and the problem he saw was that \"customers didn't get value from insurance unless they made a claim\". So he went about building an insurer that would \"help prevent the bad things from happening, or at least mitigate them\". The way Neos does this is by offering customers a package of best-in-class IoT enabled smart home devices, 24/7 support and unlimited building and contents cover underwritten by Hiscox, all managed from a mobile app.  It's ambitious, and Poll recognises that the early customer base will skew towards the more affluent and tech savvy, but he believes \"there is a big customer need in the mass market that are interested in our solution\". Essentially the insurance company is making the idea of the smart home more accessible to everyday customers. \"I think with the smart home there has been a lot of hype, and there still is and my personal view is that it is really confusing for customers with different devices and protocols out there.\" So for the past two years the team has been working on a home hub which links up the various devices and gives customers a monitoring platform from the Neos mobile app. From there customers can look at dashboards or live camera feeds, respond to issues like an intruder alert or a leak and contact the Neos team to get a professional sent out for response. Even if your phone is switched off the Neos hub will trigger a response from its loss adjusting partner Cunningham Lindsey to try to contact you or designated key holders and get a tradesperson sent out. The IoT enabled hardware includes two wireless motion sensors from UK manufacturer Fibaro, a Netatmo indoor wireless camera, two Fibaro leak detectors, two Fibaro wireless smoke sensors and two Fibaro window/door sensors. Neos owns the devices and will collect them upon the cancellation of your contract, like a Sky box. \"Our hardware strategy is not to produce hardware,\" Poll said, \"as it is tough and expensive and changes rapidly, a good device today can be superseded in 18 months.\"  Neos won't charge customers any upfront fees except for installation (there is a self-installation option) and it aims to keep its packaged solution, which is currently underwritten by Hiscox, in-line with traditional home insurance premiums. At the time of writing I couldn't make a price comparison to my current home insurance as Hiscox unfortunately wouldn't cover my property (no reason was given). Poll did say that Neos is currently looking to diversify who provides its underwriting and is even looking to do its own as a managing general agent (MGA), but would need to gain regulatory approval first. Poll describes Neos as a \"speedboat as opposed to the large oil tankers\" of traditional insurers. He wants to bring home insurance into the digital world, and that starts with a connected approach that allows customers to manage everything from their phone. Neos launched in London in January 2016 and is planning a big nationwide push this summer. One key channel will be the Zoopla property portal, as Zoopla Property Group (ZPG) invested in Neos back in November and will be pushing the Neos package to its millions of property seekers. ",

    "title": "GrowthEnabler set to disrupt Gartner model by scoring startups with algorithms",
    "content": "Investing in startups is a risky business when up to 90 percent of them are destined to fail. Industry analysts like Forrester and Gartner are reaping the benefits, attracting clients from 71 and 74 percent of the Global 500 respectively to their expert insights and market research reports such as the Magic Quadrant. But their foothold could face a new threat in the near future from an emerging disruptor known as GrowthEnabler. The company has devised a series of algorithms that they claim identify the world's most innovative and valuable startups from a wide range technologies, sectors, and locations. GrowthEnabler was founded in 2015 by ex-Gartner executives Aftab Malhotra and Rajeev Banduni. The two had spent almost a decade at the firm when they decided to use their knowledge to start investing in companies. Their stints working with big companies as both advisors and investors convinced the duo that they had discovered a huge business opportunity. \"We realised that these guys were struggling to really identify the next big technology disruption in the startup economy,\" chief growth officer Malhotra remembers. \"The reason they were struggling was because most of the big research companies out there, like Gartner, Forester, IDC were studying organisations that were more developed and more mature.\" As the established technology analysts weren't providing the insights on disruption, Malhotra and Banduni teamed up to do it instead, with a new disruptive venture replacing opinions with automation to identify and score the right startup to invest in. Algorithmic analysis Startups tend to lack the comprehensive information available on listed companies due to the inherent uncertainty of their data. The GrowthEnabler platform is designed to clean up this information. The companies are organised into early-stage, mid-stage, and late-stage startups and then analysed by predefined algorithms that cover thirty parameters across five separate categories: product innovation, business traction, financial strength, leadership and social media and branding. The algorithms encompass both quantitative and qualitative data, applying data mechanisms to the latter to standardise subjective values. Leadership is evaluated by culling data about the background of the founders, including the previous positions and organisations where they worked. A matching engine assesses the level of relevance to the job at the new company. The greater the match between the two roles, the higher the higher chance of the expertise being of value. It also analyses educational background, feeding Forbes and Footsie rating mechanisms back into the platform. Product innovation review benchmarks including patent applications filed by the founders that demonstrate their credibility, while business traction looks at the books through sources such as Companies House. The social media and branding category assesses startups on their media mentions, awards, and social media traction. It covers activity and reach on Facebook and Twitter, engagement and interactions with prominent VCs and any awards won both domestically and internationally. Financial strength is determined through financial data on funding rounds and investment raised from different databases. The  information is then validated through multiple sources \"There about 40,000 high-grade, mid-grade and low-grade investors that we built a list of, and we've tiered them,\" says Malhotra. \"We try to trawl their website as well as validation of the information.\" The results are combined to provide a relative score on the overall value of the startup. The company had previously predominately used a mixture of open source technology but is now increasingly incorporating its own custom creations. \"We're trying to make everything as proprietary and in-house as possible, simply because of security protection and also the venture capital groups like that in terms of our future growth,\" says Malhotra. \"They like things that we created ourselves.\" The business model Dozens of FTSE 100 businesses currently subscribe to the GrowthEnabler service, but Malhotra is reluctant to reveal their names at this point.  \"Our model is unique. It's not just a platform, it's a hybrid service,\" he says. \"You buy the platform but there's a layer of advisory built into it.\" The advisory layer of regular meetings with a seasoned analyst is meshed into the product to add a layer of protection for bigger decisions. Malhotra admits that some of the startups featured were initially concerned about how they would rank but now see the platform as a free business opportunity rather than a potential threat to their reputation. \"With every startup today if you ask them what's the one thing you could have more of, it would be visibility,\" he explains. \"They need money, but not infinite amounts of it, but they need visibility and that's hard. The index is a credible way of getting visibility because someone else is endorsing them aside from themselves.\" A feature called Connect Up acts as a dating agency for corporations to engage with startups after reviewing their profile through a notification system. Another offering called Product Source set for release in three months' time will help C-level executives search solutions to their specific challenges from credible alternatives to tier one companies by analysing their ratings or requesting their suggestions. If a company was losing millions of dollars a year on its supply chain, for example, and wanted software that could optimise warehousing, it could handpick companies it was interested in and automatically feed the challenge to them. It could then analyse their response before deciding whether it was worth further discussion. Future plans The company covers all technology areas, but currently the core strengths are in the areas they've studied in greatest depth, such as the Internet of Things, where a comprehensive report was recently published, and AI, the subject of the next one. Eventually their capacity will fully expand across every sector of the ecosystem. \"The vision that we have here is that this platform is a one of a kind, to the extent that it becomes the most trusted and essential resource you go to try and better understand the idiosyncrasies of the startup economy,\" Malhotra explains. \"It starts with the fundamentals of indexes, scoring, transparency, and consistency that we're trying to bring, and then it evolves into intelligence and various other things. And as part of that comes this idea that if I'm someone in the financial services sector, I want to know about startups that could disrupt me in the financial sector across multiple technology areas: AI, AR, VR, or big data, for example. \"If I am, on the other hand, in the logistics sector, then I want to know about any company who could crush my warehousing and logistics supply chain and I don't want to be destroyed by Amazon in the future. I want to be well aware of this and I want to think 10 steps ahead. \"We've organised our 500,000 startups that we're analysing across 15 technology areas and 20 technology sectors. We're basically saying, no matter where you sit we'll give you a service that's going to be effective.\" ",

    "title": "The UK's 13 most promising cybersecurity startups",
    "content": "Historically, the UK has struggled to found cybersecurity companies but that has recently started to turn change. What defines a pure startup is contentious but here we've decided to limit our horizon to the last five years (roughly since 2011) in an effort to sift the fresh from the established and to capture startups that truly count as 'cyber' and not only security.  In he past, celever engineers went to work for GCHQ - will that still be true in the future?By most metrics arguably the most successful UK cybersecurity startup of all time, Darktrace goes from strength to strength. The firm's Enterprise Immune System anomaly detection technology is now resold by BT and at least one US telecoms firm. Founded with investment from Mike Lynch of Autonomy fame, Darktrace's fame rests of the unusual Valley-like speed of its rise. Founded in 2015, CybSafe aims to apply behavioural science to security e-learning programmes specifically to cut down on the risk of human error. The premise is that it doesn't quite matter how much good technology an organisation has in place, if staff aren't trained and aware then a company is still majorly at risk. Speaking with Techworld, founder Oz Alashe says the platform differs from other training programmes because it is based on behavioural science and engages with staff. Some of Cybsafe's competitors out there, he says, will introduce training into organisations as a box-ticking measure. \"The key differentiator for us is our platform, which is a GCHQ-accredited awareness training programme, is more than a training programme,\" Alashe says. \"It's focused not just on imparting information but assessing changes in behaviour, so we simulate attacks in order to make sure people know what they should know, and behaving in a way throughout the course of the year that should be improving.\" ZoneFox is an Edinburgh-based startup that uses AI to examine, but not interfere with, network behaviour and provide actionable insight and alerts to suspicious activity.  It recently completed a round of Series A funding led by investment from Archangels, and the company is planning to triple its headcount and build a team in London. Current customers include Rockstar Games and Zenith Bank, and the business has its sights set on the financial, pharmaceutical and gaming sectors. The company claims its machine learning-enabled Zonefox AI is the \"most advanced User Behaviour Analytics platform on the market\", with the crucial difference of only combing the data that it needs. StatusToday brands itself as \"artificial intelligence that understands human behaviour\" - a platform that uses machine learning to try to make sense of human behaviour in the workplace, which could include insider attacks but also plain human error. The company raised PS1 million in seed funding in February 2016 from venture capital firms including Notion Capital, LocalGlobe, Force over Mass Capital, Entrepreneur First, and angel investors. It recently completed an incubator programme with Britain's signals intelligence agency GCHQ. Here, the company gained access to senior experts at the agency the technical and commercial spheres, and cofounder Ankur Modi says that StatusToday's machine learning capability \"certainly improved as a result of the conversations and discussions we've had with them.\" Founded in 2011 and developing in careful steps since then, Digital Shadows is based on a databases-driven 'awareness' system that searches across the shadier side of the Internet looking for the chatter associated with threats against specific firms. Imagine forensics 'before the fact'. Profiled by Techworld in 2015. Co-founded by a core group of engineers who worked at BAE Systems, CyberLytic recently emerged from a spell in the CyLon incubator where it developed an automated tool for responding to cyberattacks. Passed through the CyLon accelerator in London as a mentor, SQR is the Bristol University spin-out that has made its mark by creating one of the first business-class secure messaging apps for video, data and voice with end-to-end security and manageability. Secure messaging has hitherto been a consumer application but its potential foor businesses could turn out to be fundamental. Techworld recently covered the brand new Silicon:Safe, almost unique among UK security startups in that it has invested its development cash in a hardware-based product that protects credentials with a radical architecture in which data enters but never leaves an appliance. The system's inventors claim it can't be hacked because once placed there data can never leave. Founded in London by the Tuvey brothers (who sold ScanSafe to Cisco in 2009), Wandera is a cloud SaaS platform enforcing mobile security that can detect threats in real time. Founded by a core of graduates of Queen's University Belfast, the firm's Enterprise platform allows encrypted, centralised communications, particularly for mobile devices. Flush with $3 million in US venture funding, now based in the US but we still count them as British for the UK start. Another almsot new name, Corvid is an independent 'spin in' of larger UK company Ultra Electronics that offers real-time security-as-a-service. Another of the small group of firms based in Cheltenham and recently profiled by Techworld. Spent time inside the FinTech Innovation Lab accelerator as well as returning the favour for Cyber London, Ripjar is a data intelligence platform that can be used for a variety of tasks, including monitoring feeds such as social media for threats, customer and reputation mamangement. Winner of the Most Innovative Small Cyber Security Company award at last year's Infosecurity Show, under its Ascema brand, Wales-based GeoLang has pioneered sophisticated data loss prevention for today's demands, scoring customers as large as Jaguar-Landrover. The latter uses it to keep track of its large and complex cache of documents covering sensitive IP. Profiled by Techworld. ",

    "title": "BUILT/ aims to disrupt construction sector by digitising sale of materials",
    "content": "The cowboy builder stereotype may be largely an unfair one, but one enduring element of it that remains true is the prevalence of haggling instead of set pricing. Construction sector startup BUILT/ plans to transform that model by digitising the customer experience in a mobile-optimised web store that gives builders a better deal. Founder Nick Thomas developed BUILT/ because the market for building supplies had yet to undergo any digital transformation.  The tradespeople were no Luddites in their personal uses of technology, but a data deficit in a complex supply chain, heavy equipment and a reliance on personal relationships had previously limited its application to sales in the sector.  \"The digital behaviours are there, they're just not transferring to their professional lives,\" he says. \"They actually do want to adopt, they just need to be presented with something.\" A new generation of builders more familiar with e-commerce and a growing desire for the common retail principle of price transparency convinced Thomas it was now ripe for digital disruption.  Any sale of building materials is always negotiated face-to-face. BUILT/ intends to change that by adding transparency to pricing. \"The traditional marketplace is characterised by a personal relationship between the general builder and your branch manager,\" says Thomas. \"It's a personal relationship, and that's how the customer develops trust with the brand.\" The mass adoption of smartphones has made the old model of negotiating prices vulnerable by giving the ability to instantly search the market for more competitive prices. Builders were increasingly craving consistency in the availability of stock and more transparent pricing to match the majority of other retail sectors. \"The retail basics of range, price and proximity are never going to go away; they're always the top three things that tradespeople say are important,\" says Thomas. \"But what they all crave is consistency in the availability of stock in particular. They want consistency of service but they also want this transparent pricing. \"There isn't that much loyalty to the big names. They will say that personal relationship is vital, but you give them something better or something that is cheaper and it will ebb away.\" To provide a service to replace this, he first needed to develop an entire dataset through discussions with suppliers. All of the information on pricing, inventory controls and product descriptions needed to be constructed from the ground up, as such a database didn't yet exist in the industry. When that was completed he was ready to provide a platform to sell the materials. Thomas previously established a fashion and footwear retail business called Cloggs.co.uk which he grew from nothing to a PS12 million business with no external funding before selling it to JD Sports in 2013. His next role as e-commerce and multichannel director at discount bookstore The Works led to the development of a scalable multichannel platform that transforming stagnant website trading performance into a thriving e-commerce business. He then became the group digital and eVentures director at Travis Perkins, the UK's largest builders' merchants, which now provides BUILT/ with the supporting local infrastructure and relationships to overcome the many barriers to entry into the market. They helped him build an omni-channel platform on the NetSuite unified cloud commerce platform, which houses all the information for customers, their orders and suppliers in one place to provide a consistent and transparent service. The system shows real-time product availability online and gives shops access to the inventory from anywhere in the business Builders can source materials on a project-by-project basis by providing transparent fixed pricing online and a choice of how to receive their orders. Customers can receipt order by either delivery or click and collect or just by showing up in store. Builders can set up an online account to review their purchase history and balance and pay their invoices online.  They can create a project product list online and then visit a local store, where a salesperson can access the list and finish the purchase in store.  If the builder isn't ready to purchase any items they can instead add them to their e-commerce cart or list and complete the transaction at a later date. BUILT/ will start small and grow fast when it launches in the UK later this year. \"Our mission is to make the entire purchasing experience as painless and efficient as possible,\" says Thomas. \"Greater convenience and ease of doing business rank among our customers' top priorities.\" ",

    "title": "How The City of London is looking to change its image and attract tech startups",
    "content": "The City of London, or the Square Mile as it is often known, is synonymous with traditional financial services firms. However a recent report shows that the exclusive London enclave is looking to attract more technology startups in a bid to modernise its image. Fintech, insurtech and regtech are all booming areas within the London startup ecosystem, and the City of London Corporation is starting to ask itself if it needs to provide dedicated spaces for these startups to work within the confines of the City, in closer proximity to the companies they are looking to disrupt or augment. This will require a change in perceptions of the area, which tends to be seen as a traditional and expensive place to do business. The report conducted by the City of London Corporation and City Property Association (CPA) states: \"Young, nimble and digitally focused businesses are challenging decades old incumbents, and the City must adapt once more, responding to the cultures, practices and aspirations of such companies to stay a vibrant, populated area of commerce.\" Andy Pyle, the UK head of real estate at KPMG, told Techworld: \"The City at its core has been dependent on financial services, but as they are disrupted, and with Brexit, there will be some jobs likely to move out of London, so diversification is important.\" The first step for the City will be changing these perceptions if it is to attract a different type of worker. The report asks: \"Is an area comfortable with a traditional business week ready to meet the demands of employees who work when and how it suits them? Could it be that internet connectivity, public transport and street-level coffee culture are better served in the surrounding creative and tech enclaves of Shoreditch, Spitalfields and Smithfield?\" The report lays out its strategy for changing this, starting with a flagship, branded accelerator in the City: \"Most City property owners feel that a single, City-branded accelerator/incubator space would be the best way of attracting emerging technology and facilitating an exchange of ideas between small companies and established firms.\"  As it stands the City is flagging when it comes to shared coworking spaces in the area, with very few of London's accelerators and incubators located within the Square Mile. Pyle from KPMG points to the success of the Level 39 accelerator in Canary Wharf as a good example of how this 'clustering' approach can change the feel of an area quickly. The City is apparently looking at tech clusters in Sydney like Silicon Harbour and the transformation of the King's Cross area in London as blueprints. King's Cross has done a great job of transforming the retail offering around the station since the new station concourse opened in 2012. The area now counts Google and a number of tech startups as residents. Despite the perception that areas like Shoreditch are cheaper than traditional spaces like the City, data in the report shows that rents are homogenising across the whole of London. Naturally, cost will always be an issue when it comes to office space, and worryingly the report found that although landlords are supportive of attracting emerging technology businesses to the City, they are \"hesitant to offer discounts or enticements\". The City of London Corporation recognises its role in changing this, and says it will \"need to convince them that the wider benefits of attracting startups will mitigate the possible lower valuation of buildings containing tech companies\". \"Now that the value of diversity is being recognised, owners feel that they can work with the City of London Corporation to shift perceptions, create cohesive public spaces and refit offices that suit a wider range of needs. The City can become a 24/7 hub with a social aspect.\" Speaking with Techworld, Daisy Gleeson, marketing and PR manager at insurtech startup Digital Fineprint, said: \"As rental costs in more traditional start-up locations such as Shoreditch are rising, it is causing entrepreneurs to look for more affordable office space elsewhere. \"It would of course be preferred to be within the City where there is such a high concentration of financial companies... The major downside is that the average cost of an office in the Square Mile is PS90 per square foot per annum, which is probably too much for young startups.\"  Ishaan Malhi, CEO and founder of online mortgage broker Trussle, told Techworld: \"My perception is that the area has been prohibitive to startups from a cost and culture perspective. The City has been hugely successful in attracting large and high-salaried companies to the area and many of the surrounding cafes, restaurants, and shops accommodate for that audience as a result.\" There are still some clear preconceptions that will have to be ironed out if the City is to become a true melting pot of old and new. Startups responded to the authors of the report with concern that they will be \"seen as second-class citizens within the Square Mile\" and are wary of becoming \"marketing initiatives for a corporate innovation agenda\". Despite respondents from large corporates saying that they \"unanimously believe that they would reap the benefits of being in close proximity to young, innovative companies\" those from the tech sector displayed concern \"about the threat of exploitation by large corporates\". Incumbents also fear a dilution of the \"historic context of the City\" and are wary of the trendy fads of startup culture infiltrating the area. The report states: \"While the likes of street food and outdoor cinema events sound appealing, interviewees noted that the City remains a working environment, so the needs of more traditional occupiers must be considered in respect to crowds, access and noise.\" The report outlines the lure for the area to tech startups: \"Access to talent and expertise, a huge potential for commercial partnerships with established players and an explosion in demand for digital products within finance.\" Becky Downing, CEO of insurtech startup Buzzmove, told Techworld: \"The City has great transport links and locating in the City would be a great way to reiterate our message that we're open for business and ready to partner with more insurers on our latest blockchain-based product offering.\"  However, she is resistant to the Silicon Roundabout cliches that the report hints at. \"While cafes and outside meeting spaces can be useful, that's more for early-stage startups,\" Downing said. \"What we'd really need is plenty of office meeting space and completely reliable broadband connections. We're not really interested in hanging out with startups as much as we are partners and customers. We're not seeking to be \"cool\", we're seeking more growth, more success and more partnerships.\" Also, modern startups don't appear to value physical proximity to potential customers or partners as much as the report assumes. Downing said: \"In today's connected age, physical proximity to insurance companies is really not that important from a practical perspective. But the psychological impact of being right next door would be much greater - both for our existing and future insurance partners, and for our customers, knowing that we're located in Britain's most prestigious financial district.\"  This mirrored comments from Phoebe Hugh, cofounder and CEO of insurtech startup Brolly, who told Techworld: \"In reality, being in walking distance doesn't provide enough tangible value to us for it to influence our decision of where to be based, being in London is good enough. We also like being an outsider in a sense, as it gives us adequate space to focus on evolving the industry, whilst not being too attached to the 'now'.\" ",

    "title": "Why Pfizer is helping UK healthtech startups get into the NHS",
    "content": "Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has launched a startup accelerator programme to help late-stage healthtech startups get their technology adopted by the National Health Service (NHS). Speaking to Techworld, Dr Hamish Graham, a practicing surgeon and London manager for the Pfizer Healthcare Hub, said it \"will provide a platform for start-ups to harness Pfizer's global network, enabling them to get access to our expertise, understanding and guidance. We hope, with our support, that they'll be able to reach their goals and get their innovations adopted within the health service.\"  Pfizer says tech like healthcare devices, apps, wearables and virtual reality is potentially transformational for the healthcare industry. The initial programme will help just three startups, and is focusing on companies which have developed a product or service ready for use by healthcare professionals. Graham gave the example of a startup that has made a wearable with a CE mark or software proven in one area, say law or education, and is interested in entering the healthcare space, as the sort of solutions they are looking for. Startups in healthcare face an enormous challenge when it comes to getting their products adopted by the sprawling NHS, but the potential rewards are massive. \"You have to understand their language if you want to get your tech adopted there,\" Graham said, \"You have to understand their priorities and it is a challenge for a lot of startups. They can be fluent in their coding, product development and put a great team together but they then struggle to expand to hospital two, three and four, because they need to communicate their value in a way that a manager can understand it.\" He does recognise that no one solution will be a silver bullet for the NHS's digital struggles. Bluntly: \"If you believed you could find a silver bullet, and get it into the NHS in twelve months, you wouldn't understand the NHS well enough. You can't do that journey in your bedroom, you have to be out there working with hospitals, IT departments and patients.\" Naturally Pfizer isn't the only big four pharmaceutical company casting its eye towards healthtech in the drive for innovation. AstraZeneca recently launched a tie-up with UK healthtech startup Umotif, which focuses on digital patient data capture techniques for doctors and clinical researchers. GlaxoSmithKline is also looking towards the technology sector to try and improve its data capture for clinical researchers. The drugmaker was reportedly in talks with US chip maker Qualcomm last year to more efficiently collect and analyse data from clinical trials. GSK's consumer health division is also looking for \"patent-protected innovations in early- or late-stage development\" in four areas: \"medication adherence, health and symptom tracking, diagnosis/self-selection and treatment.\" The drugmaker wants these digital tools to compliment its existing over the counter medicines and in exchange offers \"GSK's deep understanding of consumers and clinical research experience.\" The difference with Pfizer's approach is that it doesn't necessarily want to license or \"co-create\" solutions with these startups, rather than simply help them get to market. \"What is important for Pfizer is we're not taking any equity and don't want to own anyone's IP and they can work with anyone they want to,\" Graham said. \"If you look at some of the other accelerators, they are quite big on mandatory training requirements and contact time and they may have KPIs around growth or employment in an area, we're not tied by any of those strings.\" Graham realises the Pfizer name doesn't always have positive connotations. \"We could be intimidating to small companies,\" he admits. \"I can say that we don't want IP or equity but I'm not sure how many smaller companies are ready to trust us with that message.\" By starting with just three companies Pfizer says it will be able to offer them personalised support, whether they need help with marketing, health expertise or just a rolodex. \"What we are trying to do is spend enough time with them making sure they have the assets they need and knowing what to say or who to say it to and getting them out there in front of the right people to get that tech adopted,\" Graham said. In terms of internal measures of success for the programme Graham says they have just one key performance indicator (KPI): \"To get the tech adopted by NHS trusts. At the end of 12 months that's how we know if we have done a good job. Are there people using it? We've got no other KPIs.\" So what's in it for them? Good PR, for one. Pfizer was fined a record PS84.2 million by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for overcharging the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug in December. Pfizer is appealing the decision, but helping its biggest customer - the NHS - overcome major problems will score the company some much needed brownie points. Finally, delving into the healthtech world will help Pfizer stay abreast of innovation across the entire healthcare space, not just the high-end drug discovery space. Startups have until 30 April to apply. They will compete for a share of a grant of PS56,000 and a year-long programme of support, including access to contacts within the UK health industry. Pfizer will not ask for any transfer of intellectual property or equity in the business. Applicants will present to Pfizer and a panel of experts at a pitch event at the company's UK HQ on May 18, and the winners announced in June. Startups can apply at: healthcarehub.pfizer.co.uk. ",

    "title": "Who are the virtual reality and augmented reality startups in the UK? Meet 29 of the country's best",
    "content": "Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) revenues are set to rocket from PS4.2 billion in 2016 to more than PS130 billion in 2020 according to research from the International Data Corporation.The UK plays home to a number of emerging players in the industry hoping to cash in on the boom. A recent report by GrowthEnabler estimated that of more than 800 companies working in the segment worldwide, more than 150 are based in the Britain.Here's our pick of the ones to watch out for.Immerse Learning has developed a live training platform to let multiple users join global classrooms to learn in 3D and VR scenarios. Live voice and automated reporting run throughout the sessions while the VR lets participants touch and handle 3D objects. The platform provides critical training in skills such as surgery in a non-critical envirnoment with interactive equipment. Users can instantly switch between the VR gamified learning and a webcam to add face-to-face interaction as required. Air France used Immerse to train pilots remotely, offshore drilling contractor ENSCO for offshore lifeboat safety tuition, and the British Council to provide language courses for young professionals in Saudi Arabia in different virtual environments such as hotels and hospitals. Blippar is a visual discovery and AR app that uses smartphone cameras to overlay information onto the physical world. The CEO and cofounder of Blippar is Ambarish Mitra, was named the Ernst & Young UK Entrepreneur of the Year in October. He will represent the country at the World Entrepreneur of the Year competition in Monaco next June. The company was founded in 2011 and has attracted a disclosed funding total of $99 million dollars, $54 million of which was invested by Khazanah Nasional and the remaining $45 million from Qualcomm Ventures. AR startup WaveOptics designs high-quality and affordable next generation AR lenses that can be adapted to multiple forms including everyday spectacles. The technology developed by the Oxfordshire-based company uses ultra-thin waveguides and photonic crystals instead of conventional augmented reality projection to keep hardware lightweight and energy-efficient. WaveOptics was established in 2014 and has attracted investment from Imperial Innovations, Octopus Ventures, Robert Bosch Venture Capital and the aforementioned Blippar across two separate funding rounds. University of Oxford students Arfa Rehman and Scott Gorman founded VRTU in January 2017 to provide a new way of treating people with dementia by creating reminiscent experiences in virtual reality. The technique known as \"reminiscence therapy\" is common in traditional treatment facilities, but a VR version is more affordable and accessible, while the added immersion makes it engaging and visceral. The startup's name is a disemvoweled \"Virtue\", signifying the developers' aim to add compassion to VR. The app is fittingly available as a free download for patients and researchers, and a monthly fee of PS49 for elderly care facilities. The team was recently accepted on the Augmentor accelerator programme. Visual immersion in VR already inspires awe, but adding motion is an ongoing challenge. The ROVR treadmill proves that the VR experience needn't be a sedentary one. The walking platform reduces simulation sickness by placing VR users in waist-high treadmills resembling a child's playpen.  It was designed by engineers at Wizdish, \"the first locomotion company for the new age of Virtual Reality\". The company was founded in 2009 and is currently seeking funding. Improbable is developing a platform to model reality in virtual spaces that offer new levels of scale and complexity. Its first product since it was formed at the University of Cambridge in 2012 is SpatialOS, a cloud-based engine to power virtual environments.  The company has already worked on projects ranging from a game called MetaWorld to a collaboration with the British government that recreated the entire internet to detect weaknesses.  Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm that was an early backer of Facebook, has invested $20 million in the startup. The Brighton-based AI company is bringing emotional interaction to VR with technology that tracks human expressions by reading electrical systems generated by movement through sensors in headsets. The wafer-thin system known as faceteq measures feelings through facial gestures and biometric responses and provides a new way for researchers, educators and creative agencies to study human interactions.  Emteq is also developing treatment for facial palsy and wearables that sense and respond to signs of drowsiness. The company was founded in 2015 and is currently raising seed money. Ultrahaptics was co-founded by University of Bristol PhD research student Tom Carter following student research on using ultrasound to simulate touch. It claims to be the only company that lets people feel and manipulate virtual objects in the air. The technology uses ultrasound to project sensations onto a hand and has the potential to be used for gaming, household appliances, driving and multimedia. IP Group Plc and Woodford Investment Management have invested $16.55 million in the startup since it was founded in 2013. Immersive Rehab's VR platform is designed to support psychical and neuro-rehabilitation through interactive physiotherapy games. They increase the effectiveness of contemporary treatment in an engaging environment through exercises with virtual objects in a 3D world that can convince the brain that the physical exertion is real. The solution is particularly beneficial for people with upper limb mobility limitations who often lack the necessary strength for the physical demands of traditional rehabilitation by reducing the physical barriers and clearly quantifying the benefits. The company was founded by engineering sciences and biomedical engineering PhD graduate Dr Isabel Van De Keere in September 2016 following her own physical rehab due to an accident at work. In March 2017 it entered the ten-week incubator and accelerator programme Augmentor. Opto Air is the first portable VR headset to be produced with built-in audio. The speakers are integrated into a wraparound VR headset with large lenses and interchangeable magnetic covers. London startup Opto designed the headset for casual users seeking an affordable headset for day-to-day activities such as watching movies and viewing photographs. A Kickstarter campaign launched after Opto was founded in January 2016 that aimed to raise PS40,000 had reached PS43,858 at the time of writing. Liverpool-based Kinicho wants to deliver 3D audio tools for producers to create fuller listening experiences for VR and other immersive applications. The company name combines the Greek words for kinetic (\"kin\") and audio (\"icho\"), reflecting the focus on moving sound in a 3D space. The startup is developing two separate products: a pop-up 20-speaker audio array known as Cosmos, and an audio engine called Sympan for high fidelity immersive 3D audio for ambisonics and bionaural reproduction. Kinicho was founded in 2014 by serial digital entrepreneur, coder and enterprise theorist Garry Haywood and audio specialist in residence at the Foundation for Creative Art and Technology (FACT) Stefan Kazassoblou and is another startup to enter the Augmentor accelerator in March 2017. HoloLamp is marketed as the first portable device to offer an AR experience that needs neither a headset nor hands to view. The system combines a pico projector cameras, computer vision and machine learning to create spatial augmented reality. The desktop device resembles an interactive hologram and is designed for gaming, holographic communication and education. The startup was established in July 2016 and plans to launch a crowd funding campaign to attract investment in the near future. Scottish startup Zappar wants to bring the world to life one zap at a time through a free app that lets you reveal hidden virtual content behind physical objects with a simple swipe on a smartphone. The app was developed at the University of Cambridge and uses smartphone cameras to access information about anything with a \"Zapcode\" icon. Brands who have used Zappar include Warner Brothers, Coca-Cola and Manchester City. Zappar has been self-financed from its operating revenue since it was founded in 2011 and is yet to receive any external venture capital funding. Visual-wise creates photo-realistic 3D designs of buildings that strapping on a headset lets you walk around and view the property before it's even been built. The startup was created in 2011 to makes virtual reality accessible to architects and has been tested by and is currently looking for angel investors. Purcell Architects has already tested the toolset to demonstrate how a proposal for a new extension to a London church would appear once constructed. Gravity Sketch has the lofty goal of transforming digital creation. The London-based startup wants its product to bridge the gap between the growing demand for 3D content and the lack of digital 3D literacy among the general public by making affordable and easy VR design software. The company began life in October 2013 as a research project at the Royal College of Art. The four Innovation Design Engineering students were experimenting with existing 3D design gadgets and decided to develop their own prototype. The result is the first 3D creation tool designed for touch and gesture input.  A limited public beta version of the software was launched in January for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Gravity Sketch was founded in September 2014 and has since attracted an undisclosed amount of grant funding and non-equity assistance from Imperial Create Lab. London startup Reality Zero One is building a platform to digitally replicate real objects and then stream the results in virtual worlds and is another recent entrant to the Augmentor programme. Its solution takes images from scans or uploads that are then reconstruction in the cloud and delivered to VR or AR devices. The end-to-end system promises an easy and accessible system to replicate reality in stunning 3D. The company began life in 2015 with a prototype VR app, but it functioned too slowly, so they began to automate the process. In the second quarter of 2017 Reality Zero will release its first commercially available 3D capture system. Mixed reality gaming platform Koski combines physical and digital gaming in a digital iPad app using real toy blocks to build objects. The device's camera and object recognition help the wooden bricks with magnetic joints come to life in a virtual world where characters and stories develop on screen. The gameplay develops with the actions of the player when they put different tokens on top of the bricks that represent different objects and behaviour in mazes, quests, and problem-solving situations. Koski developed from the Vaclav Mlynar's final project at the Royal College of Art in London, where he was studying a master's degrees in product design with Jakub Pollag. They've been supported by the Augmentor accelerator and plan to soon launch a Kickstarter campaign. The augmented reality property platform lets users view properties on an Android and iOS app by pointing a camera at a Virtual View App-enabled image to access content including photo galleries, videos and 3D property models and floor-plans. Vieweet uses a fisheye lens to let estate agents and house sellers market their properties with fully interactive 360 virtual tours. In June 2014, three months after it was founded, Vieweet won the Barclays Techstars Accelerator Programme. The accelerator has provided an undisclosed amount of seed funding. Curiscope produces a \"Virtuali-Tee\" that uses mixed reality to learn about the human body. Hovering over the design with a smartphone let the working organs underneath come to life on-screen. Placing the phone into a VR headset adds to the immersion. A Kickstarter campaign for Virtuali-Tee has already surpassed the PS70,000 target set by Curiscope, which was founded in 2015. The London-based startup was established in 2015 has also created a 360-degree video called \"Great White Sharks\" to lets viewers swim with the fearsome fish that won a Proggy Award from PETA. Surreal Vision has developed software that creates a virtual stimulation of the physical world that can be used in any condition whether at day or night. The technology creates an up-to-date model of everything that is present in the environment and has the potential to create a true telepresence between people in different locations.  The company was founded by three PhD students at Imperial College London in 2014. The next year, it was acquired by OculusVR for an undisclosed amount. Production studio Visualise produces VR viewing experiences to add an immersive presence to marketing campaigns. Since it began life in 2012, Visualise has added a VR touch to driving at the Audi test centre, skiing through DNA Alpine VR and tourism with Thomas Cook's \"Try Before You Fly\" campaign, The company provides video production, binaural sound, CG VR Production, live streaming, post-production, and app building services. Its rapid rise has been entirely self-funded. Scottish startup Two Big Ears develops immersive and interactive audio applications and tools to add cinematic audio to VR and AR.  The company has developed a cross-platform binaural engine called 3Dception that combines real-time 3D audio, geometry-based sound reflections and an environmental modelling engine that reflects minor aural changes in specific locations. Facebook purchased the company in May 2016, three years after two University of Edinburgh graduates founded it. The London-based startup wants to unite gaming and online shopping by creating virtual stores for real-time 3D browsing. Online retailer ASOS purchased a 10 percent stake in Trillenium and world number one tennis player Andy Murray has partnered with equity crowdfunding firm Seedrs to invest PS200,000 in the company. This startup was founded in 2009, and also offers VR services for travel, real estates, and prototype testing. Former racing videogame developer Darren Jobling founded Zerolight in 2014 to give car dealerships, flagship stores and pop up shops a virtual showroom of their to drive sales  Customers an immersive experience of the product can explore and interact with cars thanks to real-time 3D visualisation, and even take them for a spin with a virtual test drive. The multi-platform digital car configurator has attracted clients including Audi and Jaguar and has raised PS916,000 seed funding from Northstar Ventures and Prime Ventures. Proteus VR Labs was formed to create VR products that fit in with real user behaviour. The company was founded in 2013 and is financially supported by seed funding. The first product released by the startup is the smartphone adapter Freefly. Bjork fans who bough the Icelandic singer's 2915 LP Vulnicura were supplied with the headset to experience her Stonemilker music video in VR. The Freefly headset provides a 120 degree field of vision, a figure that is superior to the 110-degree provided by both the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive and the 96-degree of the Samsung Gear VR. Altergaze claims to be the only Virtual Reality company offering HMD's that can be specifically tailored to an individual's aesthetic tastes. Customers can either order a fully printed and assembled model or 3D print, assemble and sell their own headset designs through the hacker.agvr platform. The headset can be upgraded alongside the smartphone that fits inside it and uses a 50mm diameter multi-lens optical to provide a high-quality visual display unit. The company was founded in 2014 and is funded by Kickstarter. Music startup MelodyVR catalogues live performances filmed in VR so music-lovers can enjoy concerts by their favourite artists at home through a VR headset. MelodyVR provides new vantage points to gigs, ambisonic audio for an immersive listening experience, and the option to eliminate interference for a crystal-clear studio sound quality. The service will launch later this year. The startup was founded in 2015 and is supported by holding company EVR Holdings, which raised PS3.4 million on the London stock exchange in September 2016 to fund a planned US expansion. Augmented reality video games have already exploded into the mainstream thanks to the roaring success of Pokemon GO. Flying the flag for the UK is virtual reality board game Kazooloo. Players use Kazooloo to bring a traditional board game to life through a smartphone or tablet. Its game was selected as one of The Gadget Show's top ten tech products for 2016. froom Gorali Eran and Plarium.com committed $1.5 million of seed funding to the company in 2014, just one year after it had been founded. The wireless all-in-one headset from the York-based company uses a built-in computer and a Wi-Fi chip to create an affordable, untethered VR experience. Auravisor made headlines in April by teaming up with virtual reality pornography company VR Bangers to offer guests at Las Vegas hotels a headset preloaded with porn called the \"VR Bangers Hotel Experience.\" The crowd-funded startup was founded in 2015 and is said to be the world's first production ready wireless VR headset.

    "title": "New and upcoming tech IPOs in the UK",
    "content": "Tech IPOs [initial public offerings] could be heading for a quiet period. Many investors believe we're set to see the market cool off, after a number of startup 'unicorns' (firms thought to be worth over $1 billion) failed to deliver promised returns in 2015. The number of tech firms that launched on the stock market fell to a seven-year low this year, according to the Wall Street Journal. Many startups are choosing to stay private (see Uber, Airbnb, Snapchat) or exit by selling up to another firm. And it's no surprise. Venture capitalists joke 'IPOs are the new down round' (when a startup raises less capital than its previous valuation), pointing to companies like Square, Groupon or Box who went public at a lower price than planned. Music-streaming firm Deezer pulled plans to go public in October, after it failed to convince investors it merited its price tag of $1.1 billion. However you'd be wrong to think it's all doom and gloom. Over here in the UK, there have been some notable recent successes.  Last year in the UK web security firm Sophos raised PS352 million on the London Stock Exchange, meaning it's now worth over PS1 billion, and in November 2015 software reseller Softcat saw its shares jump 20 percent on the first day of trading. Payments firm Worldpay raised PS2 billion in the UK's biggest IPO in 2015 in October 2015. Here are the upcoming UK tech IPOs you should keep your eye on next... A holding company with three businesses operating within the clean technology sector, specialising in solar, absorption and filtration tech.  When is the IPO? Tuesday 2 May 2017  How much do they hope to raise? PS3.5 million ",

    "title": "Latest Uber news: Everything you need to know about Uber's latest announcements",
    "content": "The taxi-hailing app is considered both brilliant and controversial, depending on who you ask. Here we've documented the company's journey to a $50 billion valuation. Disclaimer: it's been a bit of a bumpy one... 13 April 2017 Using a software programme called 'Hell', Uber has been secretly tracking Lyft drivers, The Information reports. Uber used 'Hell' to create fake Lyft accounts which meant it could monitor how many drivers were available for new rides and what their location was. This comes a few months after Uber staff were caught spying on celebrities and former partners using a tool called 'God's View', now called Heaven. Read more on this below. 10 April 2017 Uber has been ordered to stop all activities across the entirety of Italy, Reuters reports. The ban comes after courts ruled that Uber represents unfair competition for taxi drivers, claiming that Uber doesn't respect transportation laws. Uber has been granted 10 days to stop all its activities including any advertising and marketing campaigns. After that, the company must pay EUR10,000 (PS8,533) per day if it continues to operate. 20 March 2016 After joining the company less than six months ago, Uber president Jeff Jones is stepping down, in a move that was \"completely unexpected\" by colleagues. The BBC reports that Jones grew frustrated that a new COO was being appointed and he was not being considered for the position. However, according to Recode, Jones's departure is due to Uber's ongoing controversies surrounding sexism and sexual harassment. In a statement on Sunday Uber said: \"We want to thank Jeff for his six months at the company and wish him all the best.\" Read more here. 13 March 2017 Uber announced last week that it's shutting down its UberTAXI service in London, as of the 31 March 2017.  Launched in 2014, UberTAXI lets Uber customers hail black cabs through its mobile app, rather than a normal Uber car. \"Since we first launched UberTAXI, hundreds of black cab drivers have taken tens of thousands of trips through the Uber app. However, in recent months, those numbers have tailed off,\" said Uber in a blog post published Friday afternoon. \"At Uber we always want our riders to be able to get a car whenever they want and wherever they are - no matter which option on our app they choose. That hasn't been the case recently with UberTAXI, which is why we will be ending this option on 31 March,\" it added. In the statement, Uber said that it would be focusing on car-sharing options and even fully electric cars. 1 March 2017 Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has apologised after a video obtained by Bloomberg showed him in a heated exchange with Uber driver Fawzi Kamel. Kamel expressed his distress at the way Uber treats its drivers, even telling the CEO: \"I'm bankrupt because of you\". \"You're raising the standards, and you're dropping the prices,\" said Kamel. \"People are not trusting you anymore. I lost $97,000 because of you. I'm bankrupt because of you.\" Kamel then added: \"You keep changing every day.\" In response, Kalanick said: \"Some people don't like to take responsibility for their own shit. They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck!\" Then he proceeded to slam the car door. 24 February 2017 Waymo is taking legal action against Otto, a self-driving vehicle company bought by Uber last year for $700m. Uber is being sued for stealing trade secrets and technology, according to the BBC. The lawsuit alleges that Anthony Levandowski, a former Waymo employee, took information from Waymo by 'downloading 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files' before moving on to cofound Otto. \"Our parent company Alphabet has long worked with Uber in many areas, and we didn't make this decision lightly,\" said Waymo in a blog post. 3 February 2017 Following heavy criticism of Uber's practices during recent anti-Trump protests, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has stepped down from Donald Trump's economic advisory council. Kalanick said that his participation was 'misinterpreted' as an endorsement of Trump's agenda. \"Earlier today I spoke briefly with the president about the immigration executive order and its issues for our community. \"I also let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,\" said Kalanick in an email to Uber employees obtained by the Guardian. 2 February 2017 After the protests against Trump's executive order banning refugees and nationals of seven Muslim countries last week, Uber was accused of trying to profit from the protest. This has led to over 200,000 people deleting their Uber accounts following the #DeleteUber boycott, according to a report from The New York Times. 14 December 2016 Uber's self-driving cars will pick up passengers in the San Francisco area today. This expansion of Uber's Pittsburg trial earlier this year involves each enabled Volvo SUV housing a safety driver and an Uber test engineer to take start manually driving the car when needed and monitor the smart technology. All passengers need to do is request an uberX using the standard consumer-facing mobile app. 13 December 2016 According to reports, Uber employees have been spying on celebrities and former partners. Uber staff used its 'God's View' feature to monitor the movements of \"high-profile politicians, celebrities and even personal acquaintances of Uber employees, including ex-boyfriends/girlfriends, and ex-spouses\", wrote Samuel Ward Spangenberg's, Uber's former forensic investigator. Earlier this year Spangenberg was fired from Uber over age discrimination. Uber told Reveal in a statement: \"we have hundreds of security and privacy experts working around the clock to protect our data. This includes enforcing to authorised employees solely for purposes of their job responsibilities, and all potential violations are quickly and thoroughly investigated.\" Uber also said that its \"God View\" tool no longer existed, instead opting for an internal tool called \"Heaven View\". 26 October 2016 Uber has joined forces with AB InBev to transport 50,000 bottles of Budweiser, in what is thought to be the world's first self-driving commercial delivery.  The truck transported the beer more than 120 miles with police vehicles in tow, with reports suggesting the truck driver was relaxing in the back sleeping cab.  16 September 2016 From today Uber will be collecting images of UK city streets, starting with London. According to the BBC, these images will be used to determine the best pick-up and drop-off points around the city with plans to expand mapping activities to Leeds, Manchester and Birmingham. This image data will most likely aid Uber's driverless cars ambitions. 14 September 2016 During an interview with Bloomberg last month, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick revealed that it will deploy around 100 'driverless cars' in Pittsburgh.  Each vehicle will be fitted with self-driving capabilities and be staffed by one engineer, designed to take control of the car if needed and a co-pilot to note its progress, with the addition of a computer to record trips and map their data. This move comes after Uber acquired Otto, a startup aiming to deliver autonomy to lorries and trucks. Numerous reports have suggested Uber may use these capabilities in its own driverless car plan, or potentially its own driverless lorry business. 18 August 2016 Uber is taking legal action against London's transport authority TFL over its plans to force Uber drivers to pass a written exam in English.  The legal battle centres on TFL's new rules for private hire drivers that require people from non-English speaking countries to take (and pass) a mandatory written English test costing PS200. In addition to this, Uber has taken issue with TfL's rule that drivers must be covered by commercial insurance during out-of-work hours. 29 June 2016 Uber has been operating in London since 2012 when it launched 90 cars in the capital. In the same year Uber rolled out services to Toronto and Sydney with a soft launch in Singapore taking place in early 2013.  19 November 2015 Uber has introduced a new feature which allows all of its users to switch between their personal and business profiles, so that business trips are charged straight back to the company. This will cut down on the need to keep receipts and file expense forms, but could also lead to some red faces if users forget to switch between accounts.  Read more here. The man in charge of Uber's international expansion is leaving the taxi-app company, following regulatory challenges in Europe. Neil Wass, the senior vice president for Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific will leave Uber at the end of the year, according to the Financial Times. 8 May 2015 Taxi-app Uber has bid for Nokia's Here mapping business in a bid to reduce its dependence on Google, reports suggest.  Read more here.   27 April 2015 A US court is mulling over a bill that would subject Massachusetts-based drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft to criminal background checks.  That safety provision is just one outlined in a bill that is designed to regulate ride-sharing companies without stifling them. Read more here.  21 April 2015 A court case that alleges Uber discriminates against blind passengers will be allowed to proceed despite an attempt by Uber to have it thrown out, a California judge ruled.  The lawsuit, which concerns several alleged incidents in which Uber drivers refused service to blind passengers with service animals, represents another battle over whether Uber should be governed by the sale rules that cover taxis, buses and other public transportation companies.

The San Francisco-headquartered company has expressed an interest in joining the newly-created, government-backed Sharing Economy UK (SEUK) trade body but there are a number of obstacles that need to be overcome beforehand. Read more here. 19 March 2015 Taxi companies in California have sued Uber Technologies in a federal court, charging the ride-hailing smartphone app company with misleading advertising regarding the safety of its rides. Uber has made false and misleading advertisements regarding the safety of rides on its UberX platform, and criticised the safety of taxi rides offered by the taxi companies, the 19 firms said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco division. Read more here.  11 March 2015 The two companies want to classify their drivers as contractors rather than employees, which means they are not subject to employment protection law. In separate cases, two federal judges said the status of the companies' drivers will need to be decided by juries. If the drivers are considered employees, they could be entitled to minimum wages and any tips that customers pay, as well as other benefits. In that sense, the case is seen as a legal test that could affect other companies in the \"sharing economy.\" Read more here.  4 March 2015 Uber has bought mapping and location company deCarta in a bid to both improve its driver performance and develop new services. California-based DeCarta  holds a variety of data pertaining to mapping, local search and turn-by-turn navigation. Its global location based services were used by Google Maps (2005-2008) and are used today by GM OnStar, Ford Sync, Samsung, Inrix, Blackberry and over 25 mobile operators worldwide.

Ryan Graves, who five years ago reputedly replied \"hire me :)\" to a tweet about a job with an unknown startup, is now worth $1.4bn. Nice money if you can get it, but old new technology money dominates the rankings....

The ride-hailing service is teaming up with Starwood Hotels & Resorts to boost the use of its app among the well-traveled crowd. Through the partnership, members of Starwood's guest loyalty program can link their accounts with Uber accounts and earn Starwood credits whenever they take an Uber ride. They'll earn more credits if they take the ride while staying in one of the hotel company's 1,200 properties in 100 countries.

The latest expansion brings the total amount of money Uber raised from the funding round to $2.8 billion. The extra cash injection doesn't increase Uber's valuation, which is still $40 billion. Read more here.  3 February 2015 Google has already invested at least $258 million into Uber but there are a few reasons why a complete buyout makes perfect sense. The companies are heading in some of the same directions. Both Uber and Google are now working on driverless car technology and transportation and delivery services. Uber announced the creation of the \"Uber Advanced Technologies Centre\" in Pittsburgh through a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, which will focus on long-term technology in the areas of mapping, vehicle safety and \"autonomy technology.\" Were Google to acquire Uber, it might head off a possible confrontation between the companies as both push deeper into developing similar services. Read more here.   3 February 2015 Uber will open a technology centre near the Carnegie Mellon University to help put driverless cars on the road. The research team, based near the Carnegie Mellon campus in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will focus on mapping, car safety technology and driverless robotics.

Read more here.   19 January 2015 Can Uber still be classed as a startup if CEO Travis Kalanick successfully creates 50,000 jobs across Europe this year? The company believes it can, but others aren't so sure.  Many of the world's largest technology companies, including Google and Facebook, still consider themselves to be startups in one sense or another. Indeed, they see being a startup as more of a state of mentality as opposed to how old the company is, how large its revenues are or how many staff it employs.  When asked if Uber is still a startup, a spokesperson for the company said: \"I have not heard otherwise.\" Read more here.  13 January 2015  Boston city officials will be the first to dip their fingers into Uber's pot of data, under new plans laid out by the mobile car-summoning service. The effort, Uber says, is geared toward city planning in areas that include managing urban growth as well as improving traffic flows and congestion. By seeing how residents travel across a city, for instance, municipalities might have better information for creating or reducing parking zones, Uber says. Uber's data would add to the trip records from traditional taxi and other car service providers that local regulators already receive.

The extent of the controversies has made it difficult for some people to keep up, but data analysts at Silk have now created a number of visualisations depicting each of Uber's regulatory conflicts around the world. Read more here.  7 January 2015 Uber has expanded its driver perks programme from the US to the UK as part of an effort to sign up more taxi drivers to its service. Read more here.  6 January 2015 Uber is expanding aggressively worldwide but it is clearly chasing some markets more than others. Data released at the end of last year by data analysis firm Silk suggests that Uber is particularly keen on growing its operations in Asia. Uber wants to recruit 144 non-drivers in Asia, 81 in Europe, 29 in South America, 28 in Oceania, 17 in Africa and six in the Middle East, according to data sent to Techworld at the end of December. In the UK, Uber is recruiting for 13 positions, with seven of those falling under operations, two under local marketing and support and two under public policy and communication. There are no engineering positions being advertised in the UK, despite the well-established engineering communities around clusters like London's Silicon Roundabout and Cambridge.

Uber increased fares by four times due to high demand in Sydney's central business district (CBD) following a hostage crisis in a cafe. Read more here.   ",

    "title": "UK fintech startups must focus on Asian markets post-Brexit, says Philip Hammond",
    "content": "The UK fintech sector must concentrate on Asian markets and nurturing homegrown talent if it is to maintain its position as a global leader for innovative fintech companies post-Brexit, according to the chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond. Speaking at the inaugural International Fintech Conference today at Old Billingsgate in London, the chancellor said: \"We cannot rest on our laurels, we must constantly move onward to remain the best place in the world to start and grow a tech business. We can't remain the number one place for fintech and the other technologies of the fourth industrial revolution by simply relying on our ingenuity, talent and openness, we have to go out and get the business.\"  Hammond identified the UK's time zone, talent, entrepreneurs, markets and the overarching regulatory and tax environment as being responsible for positioning the UK as the global fintech capital. He said the fintech sector must continue to \"strive and graft and fight to seize opportunities\", particularly in the Asian market, if it is to maintain this position after Brexit. The government has already established fintech bridges with India, China, Korea and Singapore to help UK scale ups to expand into Asian markets. \"If the UK is going to make the most of the freedoms it will have after leaving the European Union we have to build trade links with the fast-growing economies of Asia,\" Hammond said. Access to the best talent from overseas is a key concern for the fintech sector post-Brexit. The chancellor attempted to calm these worries, while also reiterating a protectionist stance in regards to increasingly turning to British workers. He said: \"While we need to continue to attract the brightest and the best from around the world to these shores, we must also do better at nurturing and developing the home-grown talent to drive our economy forward in the future.\"  This includes the chancellor's Spring Budget pledge to fund new 'T-Levels' for 16-19 year olds. This will ensure, according to Hammond, that \"we are producing the people with the skills and the aptitude to become the next wave of innovators, entrepreneurs and investors.\" How this will play out is yet to be seen, but there is certainly cause for concern. With rollbacks of the H-1B visas -  so important to high-skilled tech workers - already occurring in the USA and Britain's home secretary Amber Rudd confirming that free movement of labour would come to an end with Brexit, the tech startup sector is keen to see the government clarify its position over who it can and cannot hire in the future. Taavet Hinrikus, CEO at six-year-old London fintech TransferWise, voiced the concerns of many startup founders when he took to the stage. An Estonian immigrant founder, Hinrikus employs a high number of workers originally from outside of the UK at its 100-strong office in Shoreditch. He believes that whether talent is \"home-grown or immigrants doesn't really matter, we just need the best talent.\" \"When we talk about home-grown people we need to instill a more entrepreneurial attitude, as well as development and engineering skills,\" Hinrikus said. \"When it comes to immigrants we need it to be easy to import talent, and make them feel happy and welcome. If London wants to cement its position as the fintech capital of the world the UK needs to take decisive action pretty quickly.\"  Hinrikus reiterated that although he believes London was the best place to found a fintech company in 2011, \"if I was setting up TransferWise today I probably would not choose London.\" He went on to talk about the ways other major technology and financial hubs, namely New York, Singapore, Paris, and Berlin, are already copying the UK blueprint for helping fintech companies to thrive, and how post-Brexit, these hubs will only become more attractive to new companies. \"Over the last couple of years we have seen many other governments around the world look at the UK for inspiration when it comes to fintech,\" he said. \"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and other countries are looking to the UK and what the regulators are doing here and copying what Britain has done. They are looking at opening up access to faster payments, fintech accelerators, Project Innovate from the FCA; all of these things are being copied from Abu Dhabi to Korea, to Singapore.\" ",

    "title": "How financial regulator the FCA is working to keep London the global fintech capital post-Brexit",
    "content": "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recognises it is going to have to be more outward looking and progressive if it is to maintain the UK's position as a leader in the global fintech market post-Brexit. Speaking at the Innovate Finance Global Summit at London's Guildhall this week, Chris Woolard, director of strategy and competition at the FCA said: \"Our approach is bold, pre-emptive and progressive and we are committed to continuing to lead change in this area.\" Woolard admitted that firms are clearly concerned by the implications Brexit may have on the industry. \"In the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum there was a concern that we would see the number of innovative firms fall and the number of those operating with us fall away. Indeed we did see a dip and it is worth reflecting on the fact that we live in an uncertain climate,\" he said. However, since the initial post-referendum dip the FCA has actually seen an uptick in interest from firms. \"In the nine months prior to the referendum we received 264 requests for support, in the nine months after, that figure has increased to 321,\" Woolard announced. The regulator has also seen a growing interest in its regulatory sandbox, receiving 77 applications for the second cohort, of which 31 will progress towards testing, up from 24 in the first cohort. The sandbox is a digital space for firms to test innovative solutions without being at risk of breaching financial regulations. Although the FCA provides these numbers as evidence that innovation is well and good in the sector, it could also be further evidence of the feeling of uncertainty in the market post-Brexit, as growing numbers of firms seek FCA guidance than they would have had to before. The FCA's Project Innovate was set up in October 2014 to \"help firms tackle regulatory barriers to innovation, be it through clarifying regulatory expectations, examining our own rules or enacting policy changes,\" according to Woolard.  Since then it has helped the above number of firms to overcome regulatory hurdles to bring financial services and products to market, as well as enact policy changes like the upcoming open banking regulations. Looking forward, the watchdog wants to extend its reach beyond London to the rest of the UK, and internationally. Although London is still recognised as a leading hub for fintech companies, according to Deloitte, other cities will be looking to capitalise on a weakened capital post-Brexit. Major financial firms like HSBC and UBS have recently warned that they will have to shift staff away from London in the aftermath of Brexit. Earlier in the day Maria Gotsch, CEO of the partnership fund for New York City - replying to the UK's special envoy for fintech Eileen Burbidge - said that New York is \"not willing to concede the fintech capital to London\". Burbidge had earlier reiterated the belief that \"we really do reflect a financial capital of the world and laid over across what is happening with digital, we have a fintech capital of the world\", she said. \"I think the really crucial piece that cements London's position and the UK therefore as one of the leading hubs in the world is that we have really progressive regulators and policy makers\".  The FCA has identified two areas of potential growth: the Edinburgh-Glasgow corridor and the Leeds-Manchester area. \"We are especially interested in areas where we see both fin and tech colliding, so areas with a strong financial centre already and a technology presence often backed by a strong relationship with local universities,\" Woolard said. \"Our aim is to encourage the emergence of more innovative firms and will start next month to offer a regular presence, guidance and informal steers to those seeking to innovate [there],\" he added. Internationally, Woolard says that in the past few months alone the FCA has signed cooperation agreements with regulators in China, Japan, Canada and Hong Kong, and is in discussions with India. \"This transfer of ideas and innovation breaks down barriers to entry, gives firms more flexibility to innovate and increases the possibility of international collaboration, which we believe is in the interest of consumers and the wider economy,\" he said.  Woolard also warned against creating a \"Wild West\" situation \"where different jurisdictions set up their own sandboxes with different standards\" though. \"This runs counter to our ambitions that we know many international parters share: for responsible innovation.\" \"We believe a sandbox that fails to prepare firms to join regulated markets will not help firms succeed in the long term. We see potential risks for the reputation and trust in financial innovation if there are examples in the future for global failure.\" The solution for Woolard is to create a \"common understanding of the principles of good innovation [so that] we can benefit from stronger international collaboration and secure the long term future of the industry.\" The FCA is also looking to expand the remit of its automated advice unit to help companies working within mortgage, insurance and debt sectors, as well as firms that want to provide guidance instead of regulated advice. Finally, the regulator wants to do more around the impact emerging technologies could have on firms. This includes an open debate paper on the risks and benefits of distributed ledger technology. ",

    "title": "Meet the tech startups working to fix the UK's energy crisis",
    "content": "The UK faces a conundrum in the coming years. We have to cut carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050, yet our electricity demand is set to double by then. The Institution of Mechanical Engineers has predicted UK energy demand could outstrip supply within just a decade. While the energy market might be overshadowed by Brexit negotiations and global political turmoil, blackouts would inevitably plunge the UK into crisis.  But rather than being paralysed by fear, a handful of tech startups are getting to work. Their focus: ensuring we use the energy we generate a lot more efficiently.  An astonishing 54 percent of energy produced in the UK is wasted, according to the Association for Decentralised Energy. So how do we bring that number down? One startup called Electron thinks it has found an elegant solution: blockchain. The benefits of blockchain in this space is that the distributed ledger technology allows all players to exist on one platform without handing power to any single entity. This creates transparency, provides a framework for collaboration and creates an immutable, time-stamped record of trades and switches between suppliers, according to Electron cofounder Joanna Hubbard. Electron has built two products on the Ethereum blockchain. The first is 'Demand Side Response' trading (which encourages sites to decrease energy use and sell excess energy back to the National Grid). The second is a service that makes it about 20 times faster for consumers to switch energy suppliers than current rates, thanks to a register Electron has built of all 53 million supply point meters in the UK (which measure our energy consumption). It would let customers switch in two or three hours, rather than the current weeks or months. \"Blockchain is a great way to unravel customers and companies in the energy space. We're really trying to sell the benefits it can bring,\" says Hubbard. \"The idea is to be able to access all suppliers on one blockchain. The tricky thing is we need all of the suppliers to use it. We have to have everyone buying in. The government has been very supportive though,\" she says. This reselling of energy - dubbed 'Demand Side Response' or DSR - is the most cost and carbon efficient way to balance the grid, according to Electron, letting us make best use of existing renewable capacity. And Electron is not the only UK tech company working on this problem. A more established player, Open Energi, was started a decade ago by a 'mad inventor' who had the idea that if every fridge in the UK could just be switched off for a few more minutes every day, it would save a vast amount of energy. This proved too hard to monetise, so the company refocused on the industrial sector - water, utilities and aggregate companies, plus retail (Sainsbury's is a client). \"If there's excess energy we pay the balance back to the National Grid...some of these big utilities companies can essentially become energy suppliers,\" technical director Michael Bironneau tells Techworld. Its technology, which consists of a small control panel used to increase or decrease electricity consumption, is installed at 500 sites across the UK. Say a chiller or air conditioner is designed to be between 18 and 20 degrees. If Open Energi detects there is surfeit of power on the grid, it can switch the chiller on. If there's less power, it can switch it off - helping to smooth out demand and save the client money (while also making our National Grid more efficient), he explains. This sort of DSR technology works for any sector with flexibility over energy consumption, Bironneau says. \"We're exploiting clients' flexibility on their behalf. It acts as a revenue share - we are paid by the National Grid, and we share percentage of that revenue with the client,\" he adds. While laudable, clearly these companies can't solve the UK's energy crisis alone. It's a problem that will need government leadership, plus funding and support. However what these startups do show is that technology will be a huge part of the solution to our energy conundrum. We just need the political will and imagination to solve it. ",

    "title": "UK fintech startups to watch: The hottest UK fintech startups, from challenger banks to peer-to-peer lending",
    "content": "Fintech is booming in the UK, with venture capitalists and the big banks circling companies that can transform financial services, and make everyone lots of money.According to research by Let's Talk Payments more than $5.5 billion (PS3.8bn) of investments were made in the fintech industry between July 2015 and January 2016 alone.Here are some of the hottest fintech startups in the UK right now, from young upstarts to more established names that are eyeing an IPO.Note: fintech can be a nebulous term in the world of startups but for the sake of this list we are defining a fintech startup as a company that is using technology to help people and businesses manage their finances.With barriers to entry coming down fast startup, digital-only banks are starting to get their licences. Atom is one of the first, receiving its licence in June 2015 and launching services through its mobile app in April 2016.  Based in Durham, Atom Bank is marketing itself to young, internet savvy users tired of traditional banks. The website, branding and marketing is both cuddly and slick. Atom Bank started providing two year fixed rate residential mortgages through selected independent advisers in December 2016, joining its two Fixed Saver accounts and SME business lending product. Customers can track any changes to their mortgage progress after receiving a decision in principle (DIP) through the Atom app. Current accounts are due to be added later this year. The bank was founded by Anthony Thomson who co-founded Metro Bank and the CEO is Mark Mullen, formerly of First Direct, so there is banking pedigree at the top level of Atom Bank. Atom Bank has raised an eye popping PS234 million in capital so far, including a reported PS100m venture round in February 2017. Existing investors include hedge fund Toscafund, Neil Woodford, and Spanish bank BBVA. Digital challenger bank Monzo (the challenger bank officially changed its name from Mondo in August 2016 following an undisclosed legal challenge) is building its banking software from the ground up so that customers will have a current account that lives on your smartphone. This will include transparent, real-time information about your money, geolocated transactions, peer-to-peer transactions and historic data on your spending with specific retailers. Monzo gained its full, unrestricted banking licence from UK regulators in February 2017. This means the now-official bank can hold customer money and offer products like current accounts. CEO and former GoCardless co-founder Tom Blomfield wrote in a blog post last year: \"We're tired of hidden fees and charges, endless paper forms, and nothing quite working in the way we'd expect. So we're trying to build a bank that we'd want for ourselves, our friends, and our families.\" Monzo raised PS19.5 million in February 2017, led by Thrive Capital. Other investors included Orange Digital Ventures and Passion Capital, who already invested PS13 million in the startup bank. Monzo is also seeking a further PS2.5 million crowdfunding round through Crowdcube (also on this list) after raising PS1 million in 96 seconds on the platform in March 2016. You can keep up to date with what Monzo is up to through its product roadmap, which is a publicly available Trello board. While working for Skype in London, Taavet Hinrikus grew tired of paying fees when transferring money back to Estonia to pay his mortgage. Along with Kristo Kaarman he launched TransferWise in 2011 as a peer-to-peer money transfer platform which would save people and business owners paying hidden bank fees and inflated exchange rates when transferring money into different currencies. The easy to use online platform lets you convert currency using a calculator tool which shows transparent pricing on the exchange rate and the TransferWise will charge, which is typically 0.5 percent for GBP transfers, as well as how much they think this is saving you. TransferWise is UK Financial Conduct Authority authorised and attained unicorn status in May. The company was valued at $1.1 billion following an additional $26 million (PS17.7m) funding round led by Scottish asset manager Baillie Gifford and existing investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Richard Branson, Peter Thiel, and Max Levchin. Former CEO Nick Hungerford founded Nutmeg to make investments accessible as an online platform. Nutmeg acts as an online wealth manager from as little starting capital as PS500 and charges a management fee of 0.3 percent to 0.95 percent compared to a UK active fund average of 1.58 percent.  When you register you tell the platform what you are saving for and how much risk you want to take before being presented with a portfolio that you can check in on 24/7. The investment decisions are made by the Nutmeg team on your behalf, no algorithms. You can withdraw your money whenever you want with no exit fees. All the hallmarks of a good fintech company are there: an user-friendly online interface, transparent pricing and a mission to bring down barriers. Nutmeg has raised PS71 million to date, including a PS12 million round in January led by Asian bank Taipei Fubon. Other investors include Schroders, Balderton Capital, Pentech, Armada Investment Group and Nigel Wray. Founded by Oxford graduates Matt Robinson and Hiroki Takeuchi, GoCardless uses technology to process business to business payments and direct debits quicker than traditional providers. The technology brings down barriers for small businesses to process direct debits by aggregating payments, and fees are kept low at 1 percent per transaction which is capped at PS2. Customers can process payments using one of three tools: an online dashboard, account software partnerships or as an integration via an API. Customers can't accept credit card or instant payments via the platform though and the system is limited to the UK and Europe as the company continues to grow. GoCardless raised $25 million (PS20 million) in funding so far, including a $13 million round in March 2016 led by new investor Notion Capital, with participation from existing backers Balderton Capital, Accel Partners, and Passion Capital. Revolut started life as a mobile wallet app to help customers avoid fees when taking out money abroad. Once signed up users get a physical MasterCard. You top the card up from your debit account and when you make purchases abroad the card exchanges the money into the local currency so that you don't get hit with any fees. Customers can also easily send money to friends through popular channels like WhatsApp. Even though it doesn't have a banking licence the startup launched its own version of a current account in February 2017, so UK customers can get a personal international bank account number (IBAN) through the app. This means customers can transfer money from an existing bank account and route their salary directly into Revolut, but not direct debits. The app also added spending categorisation, bill splitting, remote card freeze and a chatbot to handle support requests. It followed this up with the launch of a premium service in March 2017, allowing customers to spend, transfer and exchange unlimited amounts of money in 23 currencies without any fees for PS6.99 a month. Revolut has raised around PS20 million to date from venture funds like Balderton Capital, Index Ventures, Point Nine, Venrex, along with angel investors and crowdfunding. This includes a PS6.75 million round in July 2016. Azimo is a mobile money transfer startup in the vein of WorldRemit or TransferWise with a focus on migrants wanting to send money home at up to 90 percent less than traditional remittance services like major banks and Western Union. App users can also request, send and receive cash internationally using just a mobile phone number. Azimo has raised a total of $46 million (PS37 million) so far, including a venture round of $15 million (PS12 million) from Japanese ecommerce company Rakuten in May 2016. ClearBank is the UK's first new clearing bank in more than 250 years. Launched by Nick Ogden, formerly of Worldpay, ClearBank is a little different to most fintech companies in that it is not for consumers. Instead, ClearBank provides access to the primary UK payments and card issuing systems, like Faster Payments and SWIFT, for new entrants to the financial services industry to get started quickly and easily. The startup will be using Microsoft cloud technology through two data centres, which it hopes will give it greater agility, transparency and the ability to charge lower fees than the big four clearing banks, which are laden with legacy technology. ClearBank services are due to be generally available by Autumn 2017. Ogden himself is worth north of PS40 million and the startup has been backed by John Risley, a Canadian entrepreneur, and Petr Kellner, who founded the PPF investment fund. London-based fintech startup iwoca (instant working capital) gives small business fast and flexible access to capital, without the upfront fees, lengthy forms and long-term commitments traditionally associated with business credit. The founding team consists of CTO James Dear, who holds a PhD in theoretical physics from Kings College London, and CEO and ex-Goldman Sachs trader Christoph Rieche. The startup has already lent PS200 million to small businesses.- iwoca has raised $59 million million to small businesses. The secret sauce of iwoca is its risk model, which uses big data techniques to asses small businesses' trading data to make a quick, informed assessment of risk and what credit limit they are subsequently willing to give, ranging from one month's revenue to PS100,000. There are no upfront fees, iwoca charges a basic interest rate starting at two percent and increasing the longer you take to pay. iwoca has raised $59 million (PS47 million) in funding so far, including a $20 million (PS15 million) Series B round led by CommerzVentures, Acton Capital Partners and German VC firm Redline Capital. Tide is a fintech startup focusing on business customers. Business banking is infamously antiquated and time consuming, so Tide has created a set of tools to try and help small business owners with their banking. Customers can get started straight from their mobile by scanning an ID and will be sent a MasterCard to use for business transactions. Tide also provides a set of digital tools to help simplify some of the more time-consuming aspects of business banking. This includes automated bookkeeping, expense tracking with the ability to attach notes, incomes and photos to each transaction, and automated invoice scanning. Your money will be held by Barclays but it won't be re-invested by the bank. Tide also charges lower fees than normal business accounts, with no account or card purchase fees, 20p per transfer and PS1 per ATM withdrawal. Tide raised a seed round of $2 million (PS1.6 million) in July 2016 from LocalGlobe, Passion Capital and some angel investors. Receipt Bank looks to solve a tedious business problem: bookkeeping. Instead of accountants having to receive invoices and manually input the information into an Excel spreadsheet, the cloud-based software automatically extracts the data into the platform and delivers downloadable spreadsheets, or even integrates with your existing cloud based accounting software, saving accountants and small businesses time and effort. All you have to do is get clients to send their invoices and expense claims into the Receipt Bank email address provided when you register. Receipt Bank raised PS3.1 million from Silicon Valley Bank in January 2017, with the money earmarked for expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. This follows a $10 million (PS7 million) Series A funding round led by Kennet Partners in February the year before. SETL is a payment and settlements infrastructure based on blockchain technology based out of London and an engineering centre in Ipswich. The startup has a general purpose blockchain solution for financial services companies looking for immutable payments and settlements called OpenCSD, and has already helped clients like Deloitte - which has invested in the startup - with an ID system based on blockchain. In the company's words: \"The SETL system will enable market participants to move cash and assets directly between each other, facilitating the immediate and final settlement of market transactions. The SETL system maintains a permissioned, distributed ledger of ownership and transaction records, simplifying the process of matching, settlement, custody, registration and transaction reporting.\" SETL has raised around PS30 million in funding so far. dopay has built a cloud-based payroll platform which allows employers to pay people who don't have a bank account (two billion people worldwide according to the startup) without having to deal in cash. Founded by Dutch serial entrepreneur Frans van Eersel in 2013, dopay works out of the Level39 accelerator in London's Canary Wharf. The highly-automated platform also simplifies payroll processes for finance departments, like calculating salaries, emailing payroll slips and submitting government forms. Employees can get their salary paid into a dopay account, which comes with a pre-paid Visa card to use at ATMs, in-store or online, as well as an app for managing their finances on their phone. The company has raised $2.4 million (PS1.8 million) in a pre-series A funding round led by Techstars Ventures and Force Over Mass Capital in January 2016. Trussle was founded in 2015 by Ishaan Malhi, a former real estate and structured finance analyst at Bank Of America Merrill Lynch, and Jonathan Galore, an experienced fintech entrepreneur, the online mortgage advisor has been regulated by the FCA and already claims to manage nearly PS500 million of mortgages. With Trussle you can apply for a mortgage online in less than five minutes, with no paperwork involved. Trussle aggregates mortgage products via an API feed provided by a specialist company, and works with the mortgage advisors bureau (MAB), giving them access to roughly 11,000 deals from 90 lenders in the UK market. Read more: Meet Trussle, the one-year-old startup taking on the UK mortgage industry Trussle has also built a mortgage tracking service, built on the aforementioned API, which will automatically compare a customers existing mortgage with alternatives in the market on the back end and email you if there is a better deal available. Trussle has been backed to the tune of one million pounds by angel investors, LocalGlobe and Seedcamp. Property search giant Zoopla announced a strategic partnership with Trussle in February. Trussle raised PS4.5 million in funding in January 2017 led by Orange Growth Capital and including investment from existing investors LocalGlobe, Seedcamp and property portal Zoopla, who combined for a PS1.1million seed round in February 2016 alongside angel investors Ed Wray and Ian Hogarth. Chip is an automated savings app which links up with your current account. The Chip algorithm calculates how much you can afford to save and transfer it to a Chip savings account - held with Barclays - adjusting all the time depending on spending habits. Users simply have to download the iOS or Android app and grant Chip read-only access to their online banking through an encrypted API. Chip currently works with Barclays, HSBC, Santander, Lloyds, NatWest, Nationwide, RBS, TSB, Halifax, First Direct, Co-operative Bank and Metro Bank. The mobile savings app is a busy space, with rivals like the Facebook messenger app Plum and Moneybox offering alternatives, but Chip's founder Simon Rabin - who created and sold the roaming charge-avoiding app Roamer - says that savings are just the start, with other financial services in its sights. Curve allows you to combine all of your bank cards under a single app and card. Not only does this make your wallet lighter but you can track all of your transactions in one place, in real time. How does it work? Just take a picture of your cards (current account, credit card: regardless of which country that account is based in) and Curve pulls them together into an Apple Pay style display. You then set a default card using the app, allowing you to use your Curve card for chip and PIN, contactless, cash withdrawals or mobile payments, all under a single PIN. The Curve card is build on MasterCard rails, meaning it is accepted anywhere MasterCard is and comes with all the same security, with the added assurance that your actual cards are safely left at home. You also won't get charged when using Curve abroad, regardless of which card you use or which currency you are dealing in. All transaction data is then pulled together in the Curve app. You will get a notification once a payment is made and you can tag and categorise payments on the platform to get a simple view of your finances. You will still be charged for ATM withdrawals when abroad though (PS2) and Curve charges one percent on top of the MasterCard wholesale foreign exchange rate. Update 25/05/2016: Curve has announced that it no longer supports American Express transactions. A tweet from the American credit card company's UK account stated: \"We don't feel confident in the support/service in place. We remain open to discussion with curve [sic] if we can work in the future.\" One of the key selling points for Curve was being able to use your AmEx in locations where it normally wasn't accepted and still collect reward points. Curve costs PS35 to get an account set up and a card shipped out to you, with no further fees. Curve completed a $2 million (PS1.4m) seed round in December, led by Taavet Hinrikus of TransferWise, Ricky Knox of Tandem bank, Ed Wray of Betfair and former members of the Google Wallet team. Cardiff-based fintech startup Wealthify launched in the UK in April with its hybrid investment platform, combining humans and algorithms to offer investment portfolios with lower barriers to entry. CEO Richard Theo told Techworld.com: \"We're trying to democratise investing to make it accessible with a much lower starting point at PS250 [Nutmeg starts at PS500] and the whole simplicity of design is to target the mass market.\" Wealthify will ask you to select a risk proposition, which is presented in plain language. This is then backed up by a suitability test to validate their own logic on risk models, \"so a safety net to make sure people aren't going in the wrong direction,\" says Theo. Then Wealthify will invest in a range of asset classes, like Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), with the algorithms defining which asset classes to invest in and when depending on market information and your risk profile. According to Theo, due to regulatory reasons Wealthify cannot define the returns (although Nutmeg does with its ISA proposition) but: \"Historical stock market trends over the last five years and over the MCIS stock market index shows 8.2% per year.\" This varies dependent on risk. Wealthify has been funded by it's co-founders so far and will be seeking additional funding now that it has launched. Theo said: \"There is no shortage of appetite for investing, no question, but crowdfunding could be good for the advocacy reason.\" DueDil is the UK's equivalent to Bloomberg business when it comes to getting information on companies, but with more detail. The platform pulls together data from thousands of sources including company websites, financial filings, news reports, registry data, trademarks, and country court judgments. This information is then searchable by company and presented in on a user friendly platform. This helps companies do their due diligence (hence the name) and avoid risks by identifying the right companies to sell to, get insights into their business, and make a sale. Since 2011 DueDil has raised nearly $30m (PS20.6m) from investors including Oak Investment Partners, Passion Capital and Notion Capital. and includes customers like Royal Mail, Stripe and Kuoni. Everyone has heard of Kickstarter, a peer-to-peer platform that allows people to raise funds for projects via donations from the general public. Crowdcube takes this idea and applies it to investing in actual businesses. Users of Crowdcube can play venture capitalist but on their financial terms by investing in startups, early stage and growth businesses and receive equity, debt and investment fund options in return. Since 2011 the platform has funded companies to the tune of PS138m already via 245,690 registered investors, including tech startups like Rentify and Luxtripper. Crowdcube itself has raised PS6 million from stockbroker Numis, Draper Esprit and Balderton Capital. Funding Circle's peer-to-peer platform lets savers invest in small UK businesses and earn an estimated return of 7.1 percent, while the businesses themselves get access to loans of between PS5,000-PS1 million without having to deal with banks. On December 29, 2015 Funding Circle passed the PS1bn mark in terms of funding, coming from 46,865 investors. The UK government backed the startup in February 2014 with a PS40m investment from the British government to fund small businesses through the Funding Circle platform. Funding Circle landed in the top five of KPMG's fintech 100 list, the highest ranked UK startup.  Bud is an app which helps customers bundle all of their financial services into a single digital wallet to help keep tabs on all transactions and cut through the noise. Bud plans to launch a 'marketplace' where you can compare different available products this year, but instead of having to do the heavy lifting yourself Bud will include algorithms for smarter matching of customers and products. It is also looking to incorporate an 'intelligent assistant' feature into the app.  Bud has been self-funded to this point but plans to raise its first round of capital in 2017. ",

    "title": "The best tablets for entrepreneurs 2017: What's the best tablet for business use?",
    "content": "Advice on the best tablets for startups and entrepreneurs. It's iPad vs Android vs Surface Pro for the title of best tablet for business.Let's face it, you are likely to buy an iPad. But if you are trying to start or grow a business, your choice of personal tech is critically important. You want something that is portable and powerful and able to support you in working wherever you are. But you also need something that looks the part without breaking the bank.Here is our guide to the best tablet for startups and entrepreneurs.The most popular individual brand of tablet, Apple's iPad is slick and simple to use. Secure and with the best app support on the market. It's not cheap though, and you will need an adaptor for most projectors, which is an issue when presenting. We recommend the iPad Pro 9.7-inch. It's more affordable than the 12.9-inch model and feels more like a tablet for both work and play due to it's smaller screen and ultra portability. However, if you'll be using it for mostly work, the 9.7 Smart Keyboard is on the small side of detachable keyboards. The iPad Pro will be at the top end of most people's budgets, coming in at between PS549 to PS1,029. If you definitely want to go with Apple, there is a slightly cheaper alternative. Simply called the iPad, Apple's newest release will set you back between PS339 and PS559 depending on the model and specs you choose.  You can get an Android tablet that is every bit as good as the Apple equivalent, and it will cost less. But you need to know what you are getting: the Android world is a very mixed bunch.  Android plus points include universal USB support, and the ease with which you can transfer from PC or Mac to Android tablet. App support remains patchy, however, and there is a minor security risk. Designed entirely by Google, the Pixel C is a great option for people wanting a tablet and keyboard attachment for long days at the office and for watching films or TV shows on the go, although it will set you back PS479.99. However, when it comes to Android tablets, the Sony Experia Z4 shouldn't be overlooked. The Z4 is a worthy rival to the iPad Air 2. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 is also a great choice for an Android tablet as it offers solid specs, a great screen and a lightweight design. This tablet comes in at around PS329. The latest Samsung tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, was released in March 2017. It has  an impressive display, the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 CPU and expandable storage of up to 256GB thanks to the inclusion of a microSD card slot. It's a pretty impressive tablet, and this is reflected in the price. It costs around PS599.99. Check out PC Advisor's Best tablets list to be sure you are getting what you need. Hands down one of the best tablets for business, Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 is a power PC in tablet form. No other tablet offers you full use of full Windows: any software you can run on a PC, you can run on Surface Pro. The keyboard cases are brilliant, too, meaning that the Surface Pro really is the tablet that can replace your laptop. For real. Downsides? It is - as you would expect - expensive.  Price points range between PS749 and PS1669. Depending on which specs and accessories you go for, this tablet would be a huge investment. But its impressive specs could make it all worth it. The Surface Pro 4 offers a crisp 2736x1824 screen resolution, up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage (although the 1TB model is not available in the UK just yet) and a 6th-generation Skylake Intel Core M3 processor, making it one powerful machine. However, you might want to hold off buying it as it is rumoured that the Surface Pro 5 could be released this summer.  You can dial down the price and get a Windows tablet from the likes of Dell or HP. Just be sure you know what you are getting. A cheaper Windows tablet may have a poor quality screen, anaemic performance and poor connectivity. Worst of all: it may have poor battery life. Always check the specs, read reviews, and seek advice before you buy. The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S is a good option for those wanting a relatively high spec tablet with detachable keyboard without the Apple price tag (although, it's not exactly cheap). Otherwise, the Chuwi Hi10 Pro and Microsoft Surface Pro 3 are all solid options at more attainable prices. The best convertible tablet/PC hybrids can be a good compromise between power and portability. The worst? Hopelessly hamstrung devices that are good at neither. And there are more of the latter than the former.  Typically convertibles are fat and heavy tablets with cramped keyboards attached. Unless you can really shell out, we suggest avoiding and getting a thin and light laptop.  However, if you are set on a hybrid machine, the Asus Transformer Book Flip and the Lenovo Yoga 900-131SK are good choices. ",

    "title": "Best smartphones for entrepreneurs 2017: What's the best phone for business use?",
    "content": "Advice on the best smartphones for businesses, startups and entrepreneurs. (See also: Best tablets for business 2017.)Let's face it, lots of people will choose an iPhone. But you would be wrong to do so - both in terms of keeping down costs, and of getting the right tool for the job. You need a phone that can help you work on the move, but also need something that will allow you to work across multiple devices, and to secure your data. Reader, you need an Android phone or a BlackBerry that runs Android. Here is our guide to the best smartphones for businesses, startups and entrepreneurs.Apple's smartphones remain unsurpassed in terms of build quality. Unsurpassed, but not out on their own.  Some of Microsoft's Windows Phones and virtually all high-end Androids can match the iPhone's build quality, and most don't require a case to protect all that precious aluminium. Meanwhile, Apple's performance is pretty great, but not noticeably better than the best Android phones.  The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, will have some loyal Apple users jump at the chance of a bigger screen and the newest iPhone on the market. However, going for a slightly older version could save you money and make sure you don't lose out on features.  So if you're really set on getting an iPhone, you could save yourself a bit of cash and go for the iPhone 6s Plus as it houses all the functionality of the iPhone 7 Plus but comes at a reduced price tag. Although, with Apple most likely releasing a new iPhone this year, you could hold of and go for the iPhone 7 which will probably reduce in price.  In March 2017, Apple released the iPhone 7 in partnership with RED, meaning some of the money from each purchase will go to helping those with AIDs and HIV. However, it is only available in 128GB or 256GB. Should you, then, plump for an Android? Quite possibly, but this is not without problems of its own. Android phones can be picked up relatively cheaply and if you go for a high-end model, you can get specs unrivalled by other manufacturers. However its open platform does mean that security can be an issue, something which you will see less of if you go for an iPhone. March 2017 marked the release of the Samsung Galaxy S8, which is rumoured to be the best phone to buy on the market, if you have a spare PS689 that is. And while the specs of the S8 aren't actually that dissimilar to its predecessor (which is fantastic), you will receive a better screen and access to Bixby, Samsung's version of Siri or Google Assistant.  Phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge still offer great displays, expandable storage, and compatibility with all USB-powered peripherals. And because it is Android, your device will be customisable, and compatible with Google Docs, as well as all the other Google tools you use such as Analytics, or Google Drive. So then, there is always the BlackBerry. Contrary to popular belief the old BlackBerry is still alive and kicking out new phones. And the two most recent ones - the BlackBerry Classic and BlackBerry Passport - are really good. For a BlackBerry. BlackBerry phones are good only for business: hardware keyboards, enterprise level security and fleet management, email, spreadsheets. The dull stuff. If that is good for you, good for you. Interestingly, Blackberry is releasing phones that run Android, so you can take full advantage of Blackberry's security features and Androids top-notch specs.  We like the DTEK60, it offers all the best bits of Android within the secure parameters of Blackberry. It hosts the Blackberry Hub, which is a great productivity app, ideal for both business users and traditional Blackberry fans. Which brings us to the unloved Windows Phone. Unloved, but possibly perfect for small businesses - especially if you use Windows 10, Office 365, Skype, and so on. And while it lacks the app support of Android or iPhone, it still has support for all the big apps. The media story isn't much to write home about, and the phones themselves are far from sexy. But they work. And Windows 10 for mobile offers good compatibility with other Microsoft software, great security features, and the ability for a sys admin to look after a fleet from anywhere.  Windows Phone have obvious downsides. Its OS uptake is trailing behind the others listed and the amount of apps available is embarrassingly small, but with the initial release of Windows 10 for mobile, this could all change. Particularly for business users. When opting for a Windows Phone, a good choice is the Microsoft Lumia 950. Users can purchase a Windows Continuum and connect their phone to a monitor, which will run full Windows without the need for a PC. Pretty cool.  Even better is the HP Elite x3 which offers an exceptional battery life, solid specs and a great user experience, although it will set you back PS700 plus. ",

    "title": "Alternatives to Uber: The best ride-hailing apps for people that have deleted Uber, from Gett and MyTaxi to Lyft and Grab",
    "content": "The beginning of 2017 has been a horror show for the world's most valuable startup -- the ride-hailing app Uber -- and its CEO Travis Kalanick. Scandals have ranged from the external -- tax, regulatory and driver-related scandals -- to more recent internal issues regarding Kalanick's leadership and company culture, including ties to Donald Trump's presidency, key executive departures, sexual harassment lawsuits and viral videos.  Experienced tech journalist Matt Rosoff, of CNBC Digital in San Francisco, put it best when he tweeted: \"I've been a tech journalist on and off for 21 years and I can't remember any company having a worse month news cycle-wise than Uber is now.\"  So, as users in their droves #DeleteUber, what are the alternatives for hailing a ride from your phone? In the UK there are a few options for booking a taxi if you want to support black cabs, avoid surge charging or simply stop funding a company with so many black marks against it. Further afield, Uber is competing with some increasingly savvy startups and has even conceded the fight in China by selling its business to rival Didi Chuxing last year.  Here are the best alternatives to Uber, both in the UK and abroad: The UK taxi-hailing app Hailo merged with fellow European taxi-hailing app MyTaxi -- which is owned by German automotive giant Daimler -- in 2016. This creates what MyTaxi describes as \"Europe's largest taxi app\", with 100,000 registered taxi drivers in over 50 cities across nine countries, including 17,000 black cabs in London, its only UK city at the time of writing. In practice the MyTaxi app is pretty similar to Uber in that you can get started quickly and order a taxi to your location and have it paid for using the app. The key difference is taxis are licensed and you won't get stung with surge pricing at times of high demand. In a very lightly veiled dig at Uber and other rivals, MyTaxi CEO Andrew Pinnington told Bloomberg Technology following the merger: \"Unlike some of the other services, we work with the authorities,\" he said. \"Our phrase we use is we're a constructive disruptor.\"  Uber has been battling with incumbent taxi companies, including London's black cabs, for years now, and although it introduced a taxi-hailing option for London black cabs, it removed the feature in March, with the company saying: \"Since we first launched UberTAXI, hundreds of black cab drivers have taken tens of thousands of trips through the Uber app. However, in recent months, those numbers have tailed off.\" This opens the door to companies specialising in linking up riders and black cabs, but the question is whether enough consumers care. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: Your uncle was a black cab driver Israeli startup Gett differentiates itself from Uber and Lyft by offering completely flat pricing, and works with licensed taxi drivers. Although it is admirable for companies like MyTaxi and Gett to not use surge pricing or unlicensed drivers this does have its competitive drawbacks. The hidden advantage of surge pricing is that it encourages more drivers to get into their cars at peak times in order to earn the extra money, meaning it is easier to get a cab using these services. MyTaxi and Gett facilitating normal taxis means these cars can dry up at peak times, as these drivers are more likely to be hailed down by people on the street.  Gett certainly hasn't hit the popularity or levels of brand familiarity that Uber has in the UK yet but it is a serious competitor and is the only other ride-hailing service that operates in UK cities other than London, with users able to use Gett in Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Glasgow, Leeds, Oxford, Cambridge, Reading, Slough, Milton Keynes, Brighton, Bristol, Bath, Cardiff, Portsmouth, Bournemouth, Leicester, Coventry, Sheffield, Nottingham, Bradford, Hull, and Newcastle. The company will also look to use the $300 million that Volkswagen Group invested in May 2016 to aid further expansion. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: That 3.2x surge back from Shoreditch last weekend was the final straw  The biggest minicab company in the UK has been working hard to keep up with changing consumer habits when it comes to ordering cars since Uber appeared on the scene. It has since made sweeping changes to its mobile app and online ordering capabilities. The Addison Lee app is now a handy fall back for when Uber is surging, or for booking airport transfers ahead of time, and is popular with corporate clients that want fixed pricing and support. For consumers, the app works in many of the same ways that consumers have become accustomed to in the age of ride-sharing, with no more calling a taxi dispatch office. The downside of Addison Lee is that it is not available outside of London and can be pretty expensive. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: It's raining and it's late and you are desperate London minicab aggregator Kabbee claims to be up to 65 percent cheaper than a black cab. It pools cars from more than 70 providers, giving users access to 10,000 London cabs. All drivers are licensed and minicab fleets with poor ratings get struck off from the service. The service is currently only available in London though. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: You are tight  The French carpooling startup is a bit different to the other alternatives on this list. Instead of hailing a ride, registered users of BlaBlaCar can carpool with people who are already making a journey, say back from London to university in Cardiff. The European startup has proved popular in its home market and has a sizeable UK pool of registered members, with thousands of rides available every day. BlaBlaCar raised $200m (PS129m) in a 2015 funding round that valued the company at EUR1.4bn. The investment was led by Insight Venture Partners and Lead Edge Capital. The startup has said that it does not plan on expanding to the USA where car ownership is higher and fuel prices lower than across Europe. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: You love talking to strangers   In the USA, Uber's biggest rival is Lyft. The two essentially offer identical services as far as the average consumer is concerned, however, Lyft tries to set itself apart with a more friendly, cuddly image. In terms of the core apps, there has been a fair amount of back and forth between Lyft and Uber. Both surge pricing in times of high demand and both added carpooling features within a day of one another in 2014. Lyft followed Uber's lead in allowing fare splitting the same year, after Uber launched the feature in 2013.  Lyft does have a differentiating feature for tipping drivers, but the company still doesn't recognise drivers as anything more than independent contractors, denying them worker protections and benefits. The two companies have frequently been embroiled in a war of words, with Lyft accusing Uber of ordering and cancelling rides and trying to recruit their drivers. Uber denied the claims. Lyft cofounders Logan Green and John Zimmer have been very keen to publicly take the moral high ground as of late, as Uber is enveloped by more and more scandals. 3/ We are donating $1,000,000 over the next four years to the ACLU to defend our constitution. https://t.co/0umGOlkhSx Why this is the Uber alternative for you: You have a social conscience and a liberal outlook If you are based in Southeast Asia you will know all about car-hailing service Grab, formerly GrabTaxi. Hugely popular in its native Malaysia and in various other countries across the region, like Vietnam, Indonesia and expat-heavy Singapore, where it is now headquartered. Today, Grab claims 710,000 drivers across 39 cities in six countries in Southeast Asia. It also claims 36 million downloads of its mobile apps. The startup is growing quickly, recently opening engineering centres in Vietnam and India. The app itself is pretty similar to Uber as it links up riders and cars quickly and easily. There are various tiers of the service, generally, a Taxi hailing option, Grab cars and Hitch for carpooling. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: You do a lot of business in Singapore Chinese company Didi Chuxing, or Didi for short, is the only ride-hailing app so far to strike a definitive blow to Uber. In August 2016 Uber gave up a multi-billion dollar fight with its Chinese rival by selling its local business to Didi for a 17.7 percent ownership stake in Didi and $1 billion in cash. The company has since garnered the nickname the Uber Slayer, and is set to dominate the enormous Chinese market from here on out. CEO Cheng Wei says that 80 percent of all licensed drivers of China's yellow striped taxis now use Didi to find passengers. Customers can use Didi to hail a car, taxi, rideshare or high-end private car. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: You live in China Russia's homegrown alternative to Uber is Yandex.Taxi, a company run by the country's biggest internet company, Yandex. Yandex.Taxi operates in 48 cities across five countries and reported some impressive figures for 2016: providing 16.2 million rides in December, up 460 percent year on year. Yandex.Taxi drivers are fully vetted by the company and must have private hire licenses. CEO Tigran Khudaverdyan said: \"I'm incredibly proud of the growth Yandex.Taxi has seen in 2016, we aggressively expanded our geographic reach and saw the number of rides increase 5.6 times from 2.9 million in December 2015 to 16.2 in December 2016.\" Why this is the Uber alternative for you: You don't trust American companies Uber has had a tough time in the Indian market, facing regulation and driver scandals, opening the door to local rival Ola to effectively create a duopoly in the market with an aggressive strategy of offering free rides in the aftermath. The Ola app allows you to book and pay for cars and the pricing is clear and transparent, a far cry from the old style of haggling over the price of a ride. Ola also surges pricing and has many tiers of cars and services, from rideshares to Lux services and even a commuter specific Shuttle product. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: Uber in India still scares you ",

    "title": "These 9 proptech startups will help you climb the property ladder",
    "content": "Property tech (proptech) has been on the rise recently as internet savvy buyers, comfortable with the likes of Uber and Airbnb, want an easier way to buy, sell and rent property without dealing with expensive and ineffective estate agents. Here's our pick of the bunch. We will start with the only company that has gone public on this list, Purplebricks. The online-only estate agent uses \"local advisors\" to try and smooth the buying and letting process out and can save money by not having a physical presence on the high street. Founder Michael Bruce explained the idea behind the company to Startups.co.uk: \"Using our local property experts on the ground and a unique online platform, Purplebricks allows people to oversee every aspect of their property transaction as it happens, at the touch of a button, rather than waiting for an estate agents office to open.\" What Purplebricks does differently is charge flat rates, which help transparency and, most importantly, saves consumers money. Purplebricks charges PS798 (up from PS599 pre-IPO) to sell your property (except in certain London postcodes where it is PS1,158), compared to the average rate of 1.8% of the property price traditionally charged. This leads to average savings of PS4,572 for sellers, according to Purplebricks. The fully-managed letting service is PS66 per month, with a flat fee of PS299 (PS199 pre-IPO) or PS599 in London, and Purplebricks provides a full set of 24/7 management tools. Local advisors offer support to sellors and lettors and will take photographs, create a floor plan, write a description and prepare the advert for online aggregators like Rightmove and Zoopla. Purplebricks listed at 100p a share at IPO on London's AIM exchange in December 2015, valuing the company at PS240.2 million (high street estate agents Foxtons, by comparison, has a market cap of PS537 million). Brother and sister Paul and Gemma Young founded and launched Settled in 2015 after Gemma left her job at Google. Settled is a platform that allows homeowners to cut out the middle man when selling a property, much like Airbnb but for sales.  Much like Purplebricks, property owners can pay Settled PS299, who will then visit your property, take photos and create a floor plan before placing adverts across all of the major portals (95% of all property searches in the UK are online, with Zoopla and Rightmove the dominant aggregators). You can arrange bookings remotely and Settled provide support all the way up to completion. Settled claims to save customers PS4,400 on average. Gemma Young, Settled's CEO, told Techworld: \"We're very focused on homes rather than houses, so sellers that love their homes are enabled to have real conversations\" with potential buyers. Young saw the opportunity arise from a system that doesn't put the consumer first, saying: \"People aren't that fond of estate agents as it happens, so it's a bit of a broken system with very little regulation and wildly different service levels.\" This is where Settled comes in, by offering a more personal, transparent service: \"There's lots of smoke and mirrors, and models built around a sale and volume of sales,\" says Young, \"generally one in three or four properties will fall through after an offer, and we are finding it extremely low, less than 0.5%.\" The startup moved into the Garage Soho incubator in 2015 as it looks to improve its brand awareness. Settled has completed its second round of seed funding (amount undisclosed) with the Garage Soho.  The newest startup on this list is Nested, a London startup which promises to help homeowners to sell their property in 90 days, or they will give you the money to make your next purchase interest-free. Nested was created by former GoCardless founder Matt Robinson, former Songkick CTO Phil Cowans and a former business consultant. Using algorithms built by Cowans Nested provides sellers with a property valuation within seconds and guarantees a minimum price from day one, promising to sell the house within 90 days or give them the money. Nested will review the quick valuation and organise an inspection before confirming a guaranteed offer and placing adverts on property portals like Zoopla and Rightmove. They even take care of the viewings.  In exchange for a guaranteed sale Nested charges a minimum fee of 1.8 percent once you close a sale. Nested will then take another twenty percent of any money that is made on the sale above the algorithmically decided value. Co-founder and CEO of Movebubble Aidan Rushby has one aim: putting the renter first. Anyone that has rented a property will know the familiar frustrations: trawling property aggregators to find the property, ringing the agent, being told there is already an offer, inflexibility. Movebubble's app ensures that properties are actually available, saving on that all too common feeling that your chasing ghosts. Movebubble started out with the lofty aim of cutting those pesky estate agents out of the process altogether, but, as many of the companies on this list have found out, inventory is key, and the agents are the gatekeepers. \"Originally when Movebubble was created we believed that renters don't want to deal with agents,\" Rushby told Techworld, \"the reality is they will rent the property from wherever it is. The way we look at it Movebubble is there for the renter, and the agent is there for the landlord.\" The app learns your preferences and tries to filter out undesirable properties the more you interact with it and helps filter out bad agents using an Airbnb style feedback loop. Movebubble is also trying to bring more transparency to the rental business, which is traditionally a black box, so how many times the property has been viewed and if there are actually offers in place will be integrated into the app. According to Rushby, Movebubble currently lists around 70% of all property stock (13,537 according to the demo version of the app I was shown) in London and this comes 95% through estate agents, with some larger landlords topping up the inventory. Currently Rushby is seeing the user base growth as quite slow, with just 30-40 downloads a day, with the majority of successful rentals being completed by fellow young tech professionals. For the time being Rushby is just concentrating on the product and building the user base, concluding: \"Movebubble is here to make the experience for the renter unbelievable so they go through it seamlessly, then we'll look at how to monetise that.\" Movebubble rasied a PS1.2 million round of venture capital funding in February 2016, bringing total funding up to PS2.1 million. Rentify works just with private landlords looking to rent out their property. The company operates on a hybrid platform, cutting out the expensive high street agents in favour of a 24/7 help desk and ARLA certified \"property specialists\". Founder George Spencer explained the business to Wired.co.uk as: \"We are a technology-enabled letting agent, in the same way as Amazon is a technology-enabled bookstore.\" Rentify allows landlords to post an advert, perform credit checks and issue a tenancy agreement all online. Landlords can also manage tenants through the platform including deposit protection, online inventory and rent processing, with 24-hour customer care on hand. They take a 4% commission on a no rent, no fee basis, as opposed to a high street agent like Foxtons which tends to take around 15%. The company claims to have 200,000 independent landlords signed up to the service. At first glance Rentify is far more focused on getting landlords on board than a base of renters at this time, with consumers only able to request details on properties and no specific benefits listed on the site at the time of writing. The company does claim to advertise 1,450 properties each month, but doesn't state how many are let out. Rentify has raised more than PS8 million to date, including a PS1.3 million crowd funding round through Crowdcube.  Taking a slightly different approach to the rest of the startups on this list, Appear Here concentrates on the retail sector, specifically short term rentals and pop-ups, by linking retailers with landlords to find the best spaces available. Appear Here works with both landlords that are looking to find short-term tenants for their space (for example Boxpark, Westfield or market stalls) and brands/retailers that are looking for the perfect space to display out of (such as Apple, Dior or even artists like Jamie XX). Getting established brands to use the platform gave Appear Here a solid portfolio of case studies to show off, and this helped reach the tipping point of convincing landlords to list their space. Founder Ross Bailey took an interesting approach to spending his first batch of seed funding. At just 22 years old and straight out of a School Of Communication Arts post-grad he spent most of the cash on \"editorial, copywriters, designers.\" When investors questioned his prioritising of aesthetics over the technology he explained: \"We would go to landlords and they would say: \"This doesn't happen online\" and were just really against everything we were doing.\" So he needed a website that they would want to be seen on, only then could he secure the required inventory to match the retailer demand he knew existed. Formerly there just wasn't a platform for flexible use lettings, according to Bailey, with lets taking six months on average to close. Bailey claims that on Appear Here that is down to 48 hours, as they provide all in one pricing (rent, rates, utilities and transaction fees) as well as an online payment platform and standardised legal approval through their partnership with Forsters LLP. Bailey is now working on pushing Appear Here out into new \"retail cities\" in 2016 and finding ways to leverage their unique data. \"We are the only ones out there with an understanding of where every brand wants to be, what they will spend, what the next street is, so we have a huge ability to aggregate that data and understand really interesting things around the market,\" says Bailey. Appear Here received PS5.8 million in Series A funding led by Balderton Capital in November 2014, which will be spent on international expansion into \"key retail cities\" and expanding its customer service capability. Another proptech startup focusing on more commercial property is Virtual Commercial. Former commercial property manager Andrew Vertes set out to become the \"UK's first online commercial estate agent.\" Vertes actually describes Virtual Commercial as \"Purplebricks for commercial property\" as he saw an industry resistant to technology. \"Property, especially commercial property, is a dinosaur. It is considered an advantage if you can send an email really,\" he told Techworld. For those not well versed in commercial property management the incumbent model looks a bit like this, according to Vertes: \"You get an instruction, you market it, secure a tenant. The agent gets a fee on completion, some marketing costs upfront and a percentage of the value on the premium.\" This works out as roughly 10 percent of annual rent, two percent of freehold sales and a raft of additional fees. Virtual Commercial on the other hand sets a flat fee, hence the Purplebricks comparison, starting at PS999 for a starter pack and access to the online platform. The average London agent fee, according to Vertes, is closer to PS5,000. The starter pack consists of 12 months of advertising and a 4x3 ft Virtual Commercial board to fix to your property. The platform allows property owners to manage all leads and enquiries. Phone queries are answered by the Virtual Commercial 24/7 freephone service. All leads are held in one place, where you can manage viewings, track progress and add notes. Virtual Commercial also provides training, support and templates for the relevant paperwork and referencing processes so that property owners can become their own agent. Virtual Commercial has bootstrapped its funding to launch this year and outsourced its developers to build the platform, so it is still early days. However, if they can carve out a niche in the very lucrative commercial property market they could benefit from taking this approach and being first to market. The main question will be if property owners see a PS4,000 saving as worth the extra work of becoming their own agent. London startup Goodlord is looking improve the ways that renters, estate agents and landlords transact through a suite of tools on its cloud-based technology platform. Goodlord wants to modernise a number of the stages along the chain of a renting a property, starting with putting down money, signing contracts and referencing, all processes that still tend to need to be done in branch and on paper. This meant building its own e-signing capability for contracts and using Stripe and GoCardless to facilitate payments. In theory this could mean rental properties coming off the market even faster than before as paperwork and deposits could all be done at the viewing itself on an iPad. The startup is currently targeting estate agencies as customers for the platform, counting more than 300 already and claiming to save them between 50-75 percent in admin time and IT spend as a result.  Goodlord raised a PS7.2 million round earlier this year, bringing total funding to nearly PS10 million. One of the younger companies on this list, Propoly (formerly Nanoget) is essentially a messaging service that allows landlords and tenants to communicate without having to go through an agent when logging issues, reporting problems and requesting services like handymen or plumbers. London-based startup Proply moved into the Pi Labs at London's Second Home office space in 2015 ahead of a 2016 product launch, and subsequent rebrand. It has only received unspecified seed funding at this point. Chief financial officer Ben Shemie said that it should be easier to attract customers at the lower end of the market. Shemie doesn't go along with the common line of thought in this sector, that agents are anathema, though: \"At the top end, yeah, agents are good at what they do, because they get the customer to pay more, so sellers obviously like that.\" ",

    "title": "Why open banking apps won't be mainstream until 2020",
    "content": "There was a dose of realism last night as a cross section of the London technology scene agreed that the mandatory opening up of customer's financial data via APIs in January 2018 - otherwise known as open banking - may not be the instant revolution that regulators envision. Speaking at the opening event for the Nesta Open Up Challenge - a competition to find teams creating the best digital services for small business customers on top of these newly opened up APIs - there was general consensus that open banking is over a decade away from mass adoption from consumers. Open banking is basically an inevitability now as regulators in the UK and Europe ramp up implementation of new standards like PSD2 (Revised Payment Service Directive), which will require banks to open up anonymised customer data for third parties to access via application programming interfaces (APIs). The intention is to make banking more transparent, open and competitive, to the benefit of the average consumer. Venture capitalist and global head of Fintech at EY, Imran Gulamhuseinwala, agrees that open banking is \"inevitable\", in that there is \"an unstoppable march to using data and putting it into the hands of customers\".  In reality though consumer adoption of new services may not be as drastic as regulators intend. Tom Blomfield, founder of digital challenger bank Monzo, said during the event: \"People tend to overestimate the impact of technology developments in the short term and underestimate it in the long term. I feel that is what is happening with PSD2.\" Monzo, to all intents and purposes, is very keen for open banking to be a success as its app-centric platform is set up to benefit from the opening up and unbundling of banking services, giving consumers a better interface to manage their finances from. Blomfield, who also cofounded the direct debits startup GoCardless, knows that consumers don't move that quickly though. \"People will be underwhelmed in the short term by what is achieved, but in the long term it will herald a real revolution, but that long term I don't think is five years, it might be ten to twenty years.\"  Jeni Tennison, CEO of the Open Data Institute - a vocal exponent of open banking - agreed with the 2020 timescale. She said: \"We won't see much very different in terms of services until then as it takes time to create a business or service that brings extra value. \"Longer term we can foresee a time where banking operates more as a commodity, so you are less choosing your bank account based on the interface because you can choose the interface you want to use across multiple accounts in a way that suits you,\" she said, referring to an approach otherwise known as banking-as-a-service. Izabella Kaminska, a blogger for the Financial Times' Alphaville site also doesn't envision a groundswell of public adoption from day one. \"My perception is the industry is obsessed with this as a goldmine, it is going to be exceptionally revolutionary, in the short term actually, but the consumer side of the equation is a bit 'meh'. Most people I speak to just don't care enough about their bank, it is seen as a utility,\" she said. Entries for the Nesta Open Up challenge are now open with up to PS5 million in prize money and other incentives available to up to 20 teams that can build the best service, app or tool on top of the new open banking APIs. The aim of the challenge is to bring \"game-changing value for UK small businesses\". For more information visit openup.challenges.org. ",

    "title": "Tech Nation 2017 report highlights the importance of regional clusters to growth of UK tech sector",
    "content": "As the Tech Nation 2017 report went out yesterday the UK government, startup founders and venture capitalists have once again highlighted the importance of regional \"clusters\" to help grow the sector across the whole of the UK, and not just in London. The report, which details the current state of the UK tech industry, shows that new clusters are popping up around the UK, adding to the successes of companies like DeepMind in Cambridge, Skyscanner in Edinburgh, and Sage in Newcastle. It goes on to say: \"The rapid rate of growth of tech sectors in the regions is creating exciting and unexpected concentrations of tech companies. For example Bournemouth and Poole has the highest concentration of high growth firms in terms of annual turnover; while Dundee has seen the highest percentage growth (up 67 percent) in jobs created, second only to London (up 95 percent).\" The report also notes that UK tech workers are paid on average 44 percent more than non-tech workers and that the distribution of these jobs is growing, with salaries in Newcastle, Sheffield and Leeds seeing particularly strong growth, with salaries rising by over 25 percent in the past five years.  In a foreword for the report UK Prime Minister Theresa May noted that it is the responsibility of government to \"deliver a high-skilled, high paid Britain where opportunity is spread across every community, not just the traditional areas of London and the South East\". However the idea of a Northern Powerhouse, and that the tech sector is given enough attention outside of the M25, has often led to scepticism. Although the various clusters are growing, London still dominates most metrics. For example, digital turnover in London for 2015 was PS56 billion, with the nearest cluster being Reading at PS12.5 billion. What the report does show is that 2016 saw more investment from venture capital and private equity funds going to companies' from outside of London than within. Based on data from Pitchbook for all venture capital and private equity deals in 2016, PS4.6 billion (68 percent) was invested in companies from regions outside of London, as opposed to PS2.2 billion (32 percent) in London-based companies. Of the regions, Edinburgh-based companies brought in the most investment in 2016 at PS159 million, then Cambridge at PS153 million, then Bristol and Bath at PS109 million.  Karen Bradley, secretary of state for culture, media and sports echoed the party line on the importance of distributing this investment across the UK. Speaking at the launch event for the report yesterday she said: \"Money is pouring in from around the world and our task is to spread it around even further.\" Wendy Tan White, who is currently a general partner at Entrepreneur First, takes a positive view of companies like chip designer Arm Holdings being acquired overseas, saying that it could be the UK's \"Intel moment\". \"That liquidity really pushes investment into the cluster,\" she said during a panel session yesterday. \"There will no doubt be a massive influx of investment now around Cambridge because of that. With Skyscanner in Edinburgh, I know those guys are investing and really holding companies up there. For an ecosystem to work for young startups you need a set of mentors that have existed through every stage.\" Saul Klein, a venture capitalist at Index Ventures agreed, stating that \"exits create ecosystems\". Echoing White's comments regarding an Intel effect, he was referring to the theory that a successful tech company can infuse capital and talent into an ecosystem and create more companies in the long term. The same effect can be seen more recently in the way that PayPal alumni Elon Musk, Ken Howery, Luke Nosek, Max Levchin and Peter Thiel went on to either build (Tesla and Palantir) or invest in (Facebook) some of the biggest tech companies of the past decade.  The flip side of this though is that a lot of long term value is removed from the UK economy, as these companies profits end up going to US investors. As Giles Palmer, CEO of UK startup Brandwatch said: \"I would focus on this idea that we create lots of [intellectual property] IP here and have great researchers but a lot of those guys end up creating value for the shareholders of American companies. \"So I would encourage all of us to think about how we can build UK companies and on being a UK entrepreneur. Let's take IP and talent and create British businesses that retain the IP and value as much as possible for as long as possible.\" CEO of Sage Stephen Kelly added: \"This is not binary, it is not London and the rest, we want all boats rising. The better London does, the better the UK will do.\" ",

    "title": "The UK's new breed of digital challenger banks: Atom, Monzo, Starling and Tandem - Ranked",
    "content": "As the dust settled on the 2008 financial crisis, the Bank of England started a process that would eventually open the door for a new type of bank to enter the market. In an attempt to introduce more competition into an industry that was seen as a black box from the outside and which had lost touch with its customers, the Bank of England revealed a simplified two-step process with lower capital requirements for setting up new banks in 2013.  Two years after these changes the Bank of England reported a visible change in the market. It said: \"We expect this trend to continue over the next few years, particularly where there is a gap in the market - whether it be the service they provide, the customers they target, the products they sell or the technology they use.\" A YouGov survey from 2013 shows just how far the public's trust in the banking industry had eroded. Eighty-four percent of respondents agreed with the statement \"bankers are greedy and get paid too much\". This is where the challenger banks come in. These new banks can start afresh from a reputational and technological standpoint. Not only have they not been tarnished with the financial crash but they can build their IT systems from scratch, saving on the costs of maintaining sprawling legacy systems, not to mention a network of expensive brick and mortar branches on the high street. Fast forward to 2016 and this new breed of bank is starting to get licensed. These banks are looking to appeal to modern customers with an entirely mobile, digital banking experience, with greater transparency around where your money is going and how they operate internally. They promise to offer digital products that live on your phone, with potential features like real-time balance information, deep-dive spending data, biometric security, open API integrations, no foreign exchange charges, simple money transfers and artificial intelligence layering for more predictive banking. Let's not get carried away though. However good an idea a new type of bank sounds, it is far from simple to execute. First they have to acquire a licence, then they have to create a product that is so much better than the incumbents that it drives people to switch their bank, something consumers don't tend to do.   Lastly there is the issue of trust. It is mildly annoying when Uber crashes and you lose a taxi. There's much more at stake when you make an important transaction. So these new banks know full well how important a reliable service is when trying to convince people to trust a new type of bank with your hard-earned cash. As experienced fintech commentator Chris Skinner told Techworld.com: \"People talk about \"the Uber of banking.\" There is no Uber of banking. There won't be one, and anyone that has the ambition to be one will hit a wall.\" Skinner wasn't all doom and gloom though. He added: \"Some are starting with the idea that they want to be a cool tech-based digital bank but they don't have a clear idea of where their customers will come from. Some are more seasoned and understand the customer propositions, and those are the ones I have more confidence in.\" My (entirely arbitrary) criteria for ranking these new digital banks, in descending order of importance is: Do they have a licence, funding to date, people (the pedigree of both the internal leadership and its investors), breadth of banking products, user experience of the mobile app and branding/marketing. So, the banks, in order: The only bank on this list based outside of London, the apparent beating heart of fintech, comes out on top: Atom Bank from Durham in the North East of England. Atom was authorised to take customer deposits as long ago as November 2015 and launched in full after its regulatory authorisation restrictions were lifted in April 2016, when it launched its mobile app.  Atom Bank started providing two-year fixed rate residential mortgages through selected independent advisers in December 2016 to join its two Fixed Saver accounts and SME lending product. Customers can track any changes to their mortgage progress after receiving a decision in principle (DIP) through the Atom app.  The current process doesn't exactly sound game-changing though. Atom says: \"Customers can find an intermediary who is able to discuss Atom mortgages via our customer support team,\" via email or phone. Atom works with 800 mortgage providers and will make all providers searchable once this process becomes available on the app, with the bank unwilling to share a timeline for this functionality at present. Atom also told Techworld that it is working on a mortgage tracking service, similar to that offered by startup mortgage brokers like Trussle and Habito, but again provided no timeline. Atom will be launching a full suite of banking products throughout 2017, including current accounts, debit cards, overdrafts and instant access savings, all of which will be managed via the app. Unlike Starling or Mondo (more on them later) Atom hasn't built its core IT systems from scratch, instead building on commoditised banking software from FIS before layering integrations within the middleware and building a unique front end (the mobile app) on top. Atom will offer a full repertoire of banking products, from current accounts and savings to loans and mortgages for both personal and business customers. Chief innovations officer Edward Twiddy explained the motivation behind this approach to Techworld: \"From our perspective the core engine needs to be bulletproof, located in a bullet proof environment. It doesn't need to be fancy.\" Twiddy explained that the core systems that facilitate the moving of money need to integrate with a number of legacy systems, and regulators and credit unions would be more comfortable integrating with an established, commodity software. Atom bank has an impressive pedigree at board level, with the co-founder of an established challenger Metro Bank, Anthony Thomson, as Chairman, and CEO Mark Mullen was hired from HSBC's internet and telephone banking division First Direct. Being from the North East allows Atom to present a good, honest northern front, much like BT did with its marketing of PlusNet as \"good honest broadband from Yorkshire,\" after acquiring the small internet service provider (ISP) for PS67m in 2007. In Atom's words: \"Based in Durham in the North East, we're a passionate bunch of people who want to make banking better. We're building a bank, with lots of heart and plenty of soul.\" Funding: Atom Bank has raised PS135m in capital so far and is reportedly looking to raise another PS100 million. Set up by Tom Blomfield following his controversial exit from rival challenger Starling (which he co-founded with Boden after exiting another fintech company he founded, GoCardless, in 2013), it is not surprising that Monzo (formerly Mondo) is seemingly founded on similar principles to the above. Namely: a full-stack approach to the technology and a user-friendly, data driven approach to personal finance. Monzo gained its full, unrestricted banking licence from UK regulators in February 2017. This means the now-official bank can hold customer money and offer products like current accounts. Monzo wants to make it possible to open an account without a human conversation, in under a minute and with as much starting capital as you want. As Blomfield puts it: \"I'm not asking people to get married on the first date. So deposit fifty quid and we'll give you a card and you can see how it works, and if you have a problem see how we deal with that.\" Thanks to being one of the most open in its approach, Monzo's app is the one we know the most about from a features perspective. There is a real-time breakdown of your spending habits, quick mobile money transfers, integrations with the likes of Transport for London, Uber and fellow fintech company Nutmeg, some AI layering to better predict your banking habits, zero foreign exchange rates and possibly biometrics for security. Blomfield feels that a challenger bank will have a truly disruptive impact on the industry and become one of those can't-live-without home screen applications, saying: \"There will be bank started this decade that will be the size of Google or Facebook.\" The founder is also openly critical of challenger banks that are building off of established, commoditised banking IT systems: \"If you just want to see the same old products then go ahead and buy the pre-existing products, but if you want to be adaptable and deliver 21st century expected experiences, then you need to own the stack. If you were to ask Google or Facebook if they could have delivered on a generic back-end and built a nice front-end they would have laughed.\" You can also keep up to date with what Monzo is up to through its product roadmap, which is a publicly available Trello board. Funding: Monzo raised a PS19.5 million investment round with Thrive Capital, Passion Capital and Orange Digital Ventures in February alongside a PS2.5 million crowdfunding round on Crowdcube (the Crowdcube site crashed due to investor demand from Monzo's previous PS1 million round). This brings total funding to PS22 million.  Founded by Anne Boden, the former chief operating officer of Allied Irish Bank, Starling received its initial license with restrictions in July 2016 and started accepting beta customers to open current accounts through its app in March 2017. Where Atom Bank has built its core banking systems on commoditised banking software from FIS Global, Starling is building its IT systems from the ground up, in-house, something it refers to as a \"full stack\" approach. For a fuller explanation Boden's blog post on the subject is pretty succinct. The app will offer alerts for smarter money management, helping to avoid customers incurring unwanted fees. You will get a real-time picture of your accounts and spending and money transfers should be seamless. Head of marketing Terry McParlane told Techworld.com: \"We're trying to flip the banking model on its head. Where banks have used data against their customers, our approach is taking the opportunities of the technology and open APIs to empower customers on how to use their money.\" Funding: Starling has raised PS70m to date, led by angel investor Harald McPike.  Tandem received FCA and PRA accreditation on 30 November 2015 but received a setback in March this year when its banking licence was suspended after investor House of Fraser pulled out of supplying a proposed PS29 million of funding due to \"uncertainty about whether China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange would approve the transaction\". The challenger bank needed the funding in order to take deposits and offer basic retail banking services. CEO Ricky Knox told the Financial Times that Tandem is still planning to unveil its app in the coming months, but \"we will no longer be launching savings accounts in the short term\", he said. In November it launched its app in beta for what it calls a community of \"cofounders\" to open a savings account. Credit cards, loans and current accounts are due to be rolled out sometime in 2017. Tandem has opted to use off-the-shelf technology to provide its core banking software and infrastructure with Fiserv's Agiliti platform, which it developed in collaboration with Atom Bank. This allows Tandem to go-to-market quicker than building the core system themselves. CEO Ricky Knox told The Memo in 2016: \"A really cool mobile app is great, but it's not what is going to drive mass customer uptake.\" Where Tandem is looking to stand out is in its proactive approach to money management, helping customers make their money go further instead of the bank looking to sell products that will make them money. This will come in the form of notifications if you miss a payment or approach your overdraft, as well as preferred rates for alternative savings and investment services, both with Tandem and third parties. Tandem appears to be focusing its marketing on millennials, as well as distancing itself from the sort of banking institutions the public seems to have lost trust in. Tandem therefore is a \"good bank\" and a \"new bank built by people like you,\" as shown by its Twitter cover image of people in casual clothing, some with beards, some without. Funding: According to the FT Tandem has raised more than PS100m in capital ahead of launch. ",

    "title": "How Nvidia hopes to lure AI and machine learning startups away from cloud giants AWS and Microsoft",
    "content": "Nvidia, the graphics processing unit specialist, is looking to attract startups working with machine learning technology to opt for their hardware over cloud providers like Microsoft and AWS, in a land grab for the lucrative niche of AI startups. Startups building products on top of cutting edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology require a huge amount of computing power in order to process large amounts of data, which is expensive. Cloud giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have traditionally given away thousands of dollars in credits for startups to court them onto their platforms. This can pay huge dividends if you manage to get a Snapchat or Airbnb onto your services early on, as shown by Snap's $1 billion commitment to AWS over the next five years. For AI-focused companies these credits could be put towards running graphics processing units (GPUs) - which are better than traditional CPUs at processing large amounts of data - on their virtual machines in the cloud at a discount. This is extremely useful for the kind of compute-intensive modelling that is required in the background for companies using machine and deep learning techniques. Now, the GPU manufacturer Nvidia is going head to head with the cloud giants with its Inception Program, in a drive to court the best AI startups directly onto their hardware. Jack Watts, startup business manager at Nvidia explained to Techworld that the aim of the programme, which was launched last summer, is \"nurturing those startups and helping them get access to hardware and marketing lift with us, but really the whole thing is about driving this community of startups which are doing weird and wonderful things with AI and Nvidia GPUs.\" Members can apply for GPU hardware grants and will be invited to try the latest software and hardware, such as the Nvidia Deep Learning SDK, Digits deep learning GPU training System and the GPU Inference Engine. Nvidia also provides startups with access to expertise, so they can speak to solution architects to ask questions about which hardware would be best for a specific project (the answer probably being Nvidia), or for advice on certain frameworks or cloud providers. Members also get access to the Nvidia Deep Learning Institute (DLI), with credits going towards training courses.  Startups will get the chance to catch the eye of Nvidia's ventures programme, called GPU Ventures, which got good returns on an investment in mobile game developer NaturalMotion, a company that was acquired by Zynga for $527 million in 2014. The part that will really grab startup founder's attention though is the discounted hardware. The Nvidia DGX-1 supercomputer, for example, can provide 2-3 times performance improvements over other GPU options in the market and is available to Inception members at rates comparable to that given to academic institutions. The problem is that a DGX-1 retails for PS178,000, so balancing that sort of capital expenditure (capex) against the operational expenditure (opex) of spinning up virtual machines in the cloud is a tricky proposition for startups. This is exactly the issue that UK AI startup Onfido has been grappling with since joining the 80 or so UK startups on the Inception programme. Speaking to Techworld, Rahul Amin, CTO and cofounder of the identify verification startup said that it is \"hard\" to decide when to buy hardware against spinning up instances in the cloud, and that they currently do a combination of the two. \"We probably haven't found the right balance yet,\" he said.  Onfido uses machine learning to verify government issued documents for employers and sharing economy platforms that are increasingly keen to verify users and cut down on fraud. Which means Amin understands the importance of GPUs to his core business as well as anyone. \"GPUs have been a fundamental part of this process for doing machine learning\", he said. \"We started off with a singular machine with a gaming graphics card, as a startup it was all about being efficient. We started to train models for extracting text from a document and as the company grew we have introduced various servers and each development machine has GPUs in them.\" Cost is the main issue for a startup though, even one as well funded (PS25 million to date) as Onfido. \"It has always been a concern how much we spend on GPUs,\" Amin said. \"If you spin up a machine in the cloud it is going to cost you if you run it for a long time, so balancing what is the best way to train models has been an interesting decision and a conversation we continually have in terms of optimising our hardware and providing engineers with the right level of hardware.\" ",

    "title": "How to get a job at a startup: 8 tips and tricks",
    "content": "The number of startups in the UK keeps growing, and the number of jobs they offer with them. According to StartUp Britain, a record 657,790 new businesses were started across the country in 2016. But finding the right role at the right company isn't easy.Tech careers advisor Samantha Hepburn went from teaching herself how to code to running three tech communities of her own. She shared her insights on how tech recruitment works and how to find a startup job at the Jobbio EXPAND careers event in London. (Browse the latest tech jobs with Techworld.)Startups aren't all free food, goodie bags and foosball tables, and neither are they solely staffed by developers and entrepreneurs. They encompass a wide spectrum of cultures and career opportunities. \"The nice thing about that is that every startup is looking for something different, so there is a startup out there that is looking for your skill set,\" says Hepburn. Her preferred description is the one proposed by Paul Graham, the computer scientist and venture capitalist behind Viaweb, the world's first application service provider (ASP): \"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup, nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, take venture funding or have some sort of exit. The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.\" \"It doesn't matter what your skillset is or what they do, they all only want one specific thing,\" says Hepburn. \"Humans. They're trying to foster their own culture, and every culture will be different for every company. What's really cool about this is that now more than ever it is not only about what you know, but who you are as a person. What do you bring to the table? What are your skills? What is your demographic? \"You need to start thinking about what it is. Not every startup is looking for the free agent forward thinking innovator who loves autonomy, never needs to be managed, can sit on a beach in the Bahamas and get all the work done. Not every startup is looking for that.\" If you showcase who you are an as individual they can see how you'll fit into the culture and interact with the team. \"There are so many startups out there and finding a job regardless of where you're looking can be really hard and time-consuming, so you need to start identifying what it is you actually want,\" says Hepburn. She recommends that startup jobseekers write a list of whatever they liked in their previous jobs and studies, whether it's work tasks, office environment, colleagues or social aspects and to then do the exact same thing for the things you hated. Highlight the non-negotiables to establish your professional priorities Traditional recruitment agencies and CV libraries such as Reed, Monster and Indeed aren't always the richest sources of startup jobs. The reason why? \"It's bloody expensive,\" says Hepburn. \"It costs the company anything between 10-20 percent of your annual salary to hire you through a recruitment company. Most startups don't have that money, and even if they did, they'd rather spend that money on something else. So they're using alternative methods.\" Recruitment agencies aren't entirely barren plains, but they're time-consuming to search and a CV rarely reveals who you are. Job boards yield fertile lands. They allow recruitment agencies to post relevant roles or let you apply directly to the hiring company. AngelList, Jobbio, Unicorn Hunt and Tech City Jobs all advertise a wide selection of startup jobs. Tech mailing lists are another avenue, and the production costs force companies to post their job advertisements strategically. \"The chances are if you're reading a mailing list, you're the demographic they're looking to hire,\" explains Hepburn. \"So take a punt and apply.\" Don't neglect to search through a company's cheapest place to advertise: its own website. The list of operating startups is constantly changing. Tech Britain provides a comprehensive map of the country's startup community and lets user search by industry to find the sector in which they're most interested. Even if a company that you love is not advertising a role, you can reach out to them regardless. If it doesn't result in a job immediately, it may still do in future. Startups tend to grow organically, expanding an idea devised by friends into a team composed of former colleagues and acquaintances. \"A lot of hiring through startups happens through a referral process of people they know,\" says. \"So how do you get hired? You get into their network.\" You don't have to stalk them at their yoga class. Networking events take place every day. They can be found through Meetup groups such as Find a Tech Job, communities such as Circle, and mailing lists devised by working spaces or organisations such as General Assembly. The events often centre on a talk, but the networking drinks afterwards provide a better chance to meet people and learn about their companies. Even if it doesn't lead directly to your dream job, meeting people who have found theirs can help teach you how to get yours. At the very least, being an active member of a community will be a useful addition to your CV. The CV needs to reflect the requirements of the job that you're applying for, so it may need modifications for different individual roles. Cover letters are another important document to attract a potential employee's attention. \"I say short and sweet but you need to not only tell them why you are good for the role, you need to tell them why you chose them,\" Hepburn suggests. \"Why out of all the startups in the world, do you want to work for them? People want people who want to work there. It's hard, it's long hours, it's smaller teams, people have to get their hands dirty, so you need to write in that cover letter why it is.\" Lacking a specific skill doesn't mean that you can't learn it. Sometimes showing your interest and passion is more important than your qualifications. Global corporations may boast massive HR departments, but they'll likely be small ones at a startup, if there's any HR team at all. The head of the department will often be the person responsible for recruitment. \"The marketing team needs to grow? The marketing manager is probably looking for a candidate,\" says Hepburn. \"They have a full-time job to do and they have to recruit you. Once you've joined, their workload will probably drop, but they've got to get the work done. So if you ping them an email, drop an application and you don't hear back, it doesn't mean they don't like you.\" Recruitment is a skill and they might not have the time or training to do it efficiently. Sometimes when startups are growing fast they hire new roles without knowing exactly what they are looking for, so talk to them and offer your own advice. They'll value your feedback and honesty even if you think that they don't need you. It might lead them to remember you when they're looking for a more appropriate role. Whichever part of the application of the application process you're at, don't be afraid to follow up. Hepburn likes to receive an email reminder a week after the initial contact. \"But then I also have a three strike rule,\" she adds. \"If after three times they don't get back to you, move on. One, they obviously know whether to respond, and two, you've got better things to do.\" Don't burn your bridges if you don't get your job, as they may still want you in the future. Staying in touch could have further career benefits. \"Keep that connection open, stay in their network,\" says Hepburn. \"One, they could actually phone you up at a later date and you could go work for them, and two, the industry is actually smaller than you think and they could refer you into other roles.\" ",

    "title": "Never mind 'perks' - here's why tech companies should focus on culture",
    "content": "Ping pong tables, free food, slides, sleeping pods, pet-friendly offices and on-site gyms are just a few of the perks tech companies like to boast they offer to employees. Some of the benefits on offer sound amazing. Who wouldn't want desk massages? But these attention-grabbing schemes can come at a price for employees: high stress and long hours. \"Don't confuse perks with a positive workplace culture,\" Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at the University of Manchester, tells Techworld. \"For most, perks are about attracting and retaining talent, while providing an environment that can help them to do their best work...Every company has their reasons. I think these are often sound and sometimes misguided,\" says Rob O'Donovan, cofounder of human resources startup CharlieHR. However \"perks are not the thing that makes a person's job satisfying,\" Cooper says. \"What causes people satisfaction at work? Number one is to be valued and trusted. Most important is good relationships with work colleagues,\" he adds. At best, perks can be the icing on the cake of a healthy, happy work environment. But at worst, they can be infantilising (bales of hay to sit on in meetings, anyone?) and trapping (who needs to leave the office if there's a gym, napping areas and free food?!). Perks can be \"tactical interventions that seek to address cultural malaise at a reactionary level...sadly many people think that by only treating surface symptoms, cultural magic will happen\", says Esko Reinikainen, 'culture hacker' and cofounder of Satori Lab. O'Donovan agrees: \"Where it goes wrong is when perks are considered a silver bullet to problems and there isn't a clearly defined or well thought through strategy. There's the idea that if you stick a ping pong table in the office and fill the fridge with free beer everyone will be happy, but it's far more nuanced than that.\" \"These perks can even begin to make people develop lopsided relationships. If you look at the people in these tech companies they work long hours and sit in front of screens. As many diversions as there are in the office, they don't have the time to make the most of it,\" Cooper adds. So what should firms focus on instead? More face-to-face contact, reasonable working hours, ensuring manageable workloads and good quality managers for starters, says Cooper. \"In the end it's about relationships. We've got to change the nature of the work environment. We need more face-to-face contact, no sending of emails in the same building, and we need people to switch off after work,\" he says. One of the leading indicators of happiness at work is your relationship with your line manager, says Cooper. \"If they are bad and inefficient, or socially insensitive, that will damage people's health,\" he explains. Some firms have taken the idea of trust and transparency to another level: trivago allows staff to determine their own working hours and they have unlimited holidays, according to organisational development lead Anitta Krishan. \"We believe that the measure of an employee's performance is not time but the value they add to our business,\" she says. Companies should encourage people to interact and form good relationships with work colleagues if they want staff to be happy at work, according to Cooper. He also recommends restricting email access out-of-hours (as per Daimler and the French government). \"I'm not negative about these perks and creating that kind of environment. But it isn't the answer to the productivity puzzle. The leading cause of absence from work is stress, so we have to think about that carefully,\" he adds. The main priority should be identifying which patterns of behaviour contribute to or detract from a healthy culture, says Reinikainen. \"From that awareness, organisations are in the position to develop strategies that amplify or dampen the issues that incentivise or disincentivise staff from behaving in the ways that contribute to the desired healthy culture,\" he says. Ultimately, the things that make people happy are having good relationships at work, being paid properly, feeling trusted and valued by your line manager and feeling you have control and autonomy in your job, according to Cooper. Perhaps it is that, and not perks, that tech companies should pay a bit more attention to if they truly value the happiness of their staff. ",

    "title": "10 UK RegTech startups to watch: meet the UK startups making regulation and compliance smarter",
    "content": "RegTech startups tend to focus on helping financial institutions contend with growing regulatory requirements after the 2008 financial crash, including automation of compliance tasks, mitigating operational risks and improving risk assessment through smarter use of data and more intuitive software.Deloitte's 2016 report (pdf) 'Is RegTech the new FinTech?' puts it simply: \"Increasing levels of regulation and a greater focus on data and reporting has however brought the RegTech offering into greater focus thereby creating more value for the firms that invest in these solutions.\"Rob Moffat, partner at Balderton Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in two RegTech startups on this list, told Techworld: \"The banks are under pressure and finding it hard to find new revenue sources. There is more and more regulatory costs, so they are more open to ways to change and improve there.\"Here are some of the most innovative RegTech startups in the UK today, whether they are helping big banks stay ahead of their complex compliance requirements, or businesses remain compliant through smarter anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) checks.London-based credit risk management startup Credit Benchmark was founded in 2012 by ex-Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers employee Mark Faulkner. It specialises in pooling, aggregating and anonymising credit risk data from leading global banks, so that financial institutions can make better risk management and capital allocation decisions. Credit Benchmark completed a $20 million (PS16.5 million) funding round in July 2015 led by Balderton Capital. ComplyAdvantage is another Balderton Capital-backed RegTech startup which provides businesses with a feed of proprietary anti-money laundering (AML) risk data as well as on-boarding screening solutions and a monitoring platform for know your customer (KYC) processes. The system collects data from sources such as Interpol's watch list, international sanctions and media reports to automate due diligence on clients that pose a criminal risk. Off the back of this data it can provide solutions like enhanced due diligence reports, risk and compliance advice and HR services. Stephen Ball, VP of sales and marketing, told Business Insider: \"We're focused around understanding the risk around people and companies you do business with. What we've built is an AI and machine learning thing under the radar for several years. It's a very difficult thing to do, we've invested millions in building our team and to monitor global data sources and build profiles of people who pose financial crime risk.\" ComplyAdvantage raised $8.2 million (PS6.8 million) led by Balderton Capital in October 2016. London startup Onfido is using machine learning to provide organisations with faster access to robust identity and background checks for employees and clients. Founded by a trio of Oxford graduates, the platform plugs into various publicly available databases to give employers quick identity verification and background checks for things like employment and criminal records. In their own words, Onfido's \"intelligent software revolutionises the archaic background checking industry through automated data aggregation and verification\". Where this can help with regulation is for employee background checks and anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulatory requirements. Onfido raised a strong Series B funding round of $25 million (PS19 million) in April, led by Idinvest Partners. The London startup DueDil's underlying database allows for compliance teams to self serve reports on clients to aid in AML and KYC reporting. The DueDil platform pulls together data from thousands of sources including company websites, financial filings, news reports, registry data, trademarks, and country court judgments. This information is then searchable by company and presented on a user friendly platform. This helps companies do their due diligence (hence the name) and avoid risks by identifying the right companies to sell to, get insights into their business, and make a sale. Since 2011 DueDil has raised nearly $30m (PS20.6m) from investors including Oak Investment Partners, Passion Capital and Notion Capital. Its customers include Royal Mail, Stripe and Kuoni. CheckRecipient saves you from the horror situation of sending a sensitive email to the wrong recipient. The core product, called Guardian, analyses millions of data points across your organisation's email network to detect patterns of behaviour and surface misaddressed emails. If the machine learning algorithm spots an unusual email address or detects potentially sensitive information in the content it will prompt the sender to double check before sending. It also provides pre-packaged solutions for preventing misaddressed emails as well as problems like email rules, compliance and audit and sensitive attachment protection. CheckRecipient integrates with existing email platforms including Microsoft Exchange and Citrix. The startup is institutionally backed by Winton Ventures. A graduate from the Microsoft London accelerator, Suade was founded by two former city traders and focuses on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) which helps firms simplify their compliance processes and regulatory obligations. Suade wants to give everyone involved with the regulatory submission process a single platform, with automated workflows and a single source of truth when it comes to the data. Cofounder Diana Paredes told Techworld that their technology helps organisations move away from legacy systems, \"by leveraging modern technology you can do things faster, more efficiently and transparently. Openness is key in regulation\". Suade has received funding from the European Commission and ODI (Open Data Institute) to work on an open source project called Financial Regulatory Data Schema (FIRE) and was part of the government's Afterburner Programme. East-London based startup FundApps is going after the very specific business problems of shareholder disclosure. The solution is a cloud-based system which automates shareholding reporting. The API delivered platform brings together up-to-date regulation information from its partner Aosphere, with pre-populated filing documents that promise to cut down on human errors and save compliance teams time by matching and automating a key part of their workflow. FundApps has been bootstrap funded up to this point. Similar to Onfido, Oxford based RegTech startup Contego focuses on checks for people, clients and ID documents to ensure compliance. Its underlying database allows Contego to provide risk management tools for companies to perform employee screening, fraud investigation, KYC and AML checks, and monitoring services. Customers can integrate Contego into existing systems and workflows with its API. Contego received PS900,000 in seed funding in 2013 from the Rainbow Seed Fund; the Angel CoFund and a set of angel investors. Percentile focuses on building software for risk officers at capital markets firms to stay abreast of regulatory requirements like stress testing and the Basel III framework. The London startup wants to help risk managers get away from spreadsheets. It automates and aggregates risk across the organisation and the wider market to take away some of the more tedious work related to regulatory requirements. London-based regtech startup Kompli Global provides organisations with identity and background vetting for staff and customers, helping them to spot 'politically exposed persons' (people entrusted with a prominent public function). It was founded by serial entrepreneur John Davies (pictured) in July 2016.  Using its own Boolean search engine and local staff in every major country, Kompli helps companies vet individuals, and spot and continuously monitor PEPs and their associates around the globe. This makes it easier for organisations to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering regulations while onboarding and maintaining relationships with people and companies. ",

    "title": "How the Powervault intelligent home battery is transforming domestic energy storage",
    "content": "The United Kingdom is on the cusp of an energy crisis. A recent study by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) claimed that increasing usage, the loss of coal and the closure of nuclear power stations could lead electricity demand to exceed supply by 40-55 percent by 2025. Hopes have been pinned on the power of renewable energy to address the gap, but without dramatically improved storage options, it will remain incapable of supporting the maximum levels of demand. Powervault offers a solution. The intelligent home battery is designed to automatically store solar and off-peak grid electricity, ready to be unleashed whenever it's needed. Powervault CEO Joe Warren first encountered the challenges of energy consumption at the beginning his career in the internet sector in the 1990s, where he had to ensure there was enough electricity to keep tens of thousands of computers running. Warren has been working in what he calls the \"smart grid sector\" for about ten years, investigating new ways of managing electricity on the network. \"About five years ago I realised that we were deploying so much wind and solar energy that we really needed to find some way of storing it so we could use it when we needed it,\" he says. \"That's because a lot of wind energy and a certain amount of solar energy effectively ends up being wasted because it's not needed at the time it's generated.\" He discovered that storage system at Powervault in 2014. The company developed a consumer battery device and appliance for homeowners that stores low-cost solar electricity without having to buy it from the centralised grid. Later that year, Powervault launched the first plug-and-play energy storage device. Inside the Powervault cube are a collection of power electronics to make the energy usable, a monitoring system to check energy is being generated or consumed, control electronics that determine when to charge or discharge, and batteries to power it. \"If you're generating electricity and that's going back onto the grid, it charges up the batteries,\" says Warren. \"And conversely, if you're consuming electricity then it will discharge the batteries to reduce your electricity bill. \"If you have solar panels, most of the electricity typically goes out onto the grid and our device can keep that in your house.\"  Data analytics through a cloud-based system optimise the scheduled charging of the Powervault to take account of price variations at different times of the day. This lets customers on time-of-use tariffs save money by charging up on electricity during the off-peak hours while they sleep. The feature should prove particularly useful in light of the government pledge to install smart meters in every home UK by 2020. The device holds roughly enough electricity to power between one and two-thirds of the electricity most people use in a day. It's about the size of a slimline dishwasher, and users typically install them in their garage or utility room. Last year Powervault launched a new version of the product. Alex De Winter, a former British Gas employee from Leicester, was one of the first customers to purchase the new device. Alex had been spending PS15-20 per month on electricity before he decided to install solar panels on his roof. They caused his bills to drop to PS6-7 per month in the summer and PS15-18 in the winter. He then used an electronic monitoring system to discover that 90 percent of the energy generated by the solar panels was being exported back to the grid. The Powervault promised to reduce this. Alex and his partner installed the device and made a few changes to their electricity consumption habits to maximise the benefits. \"These smart behaviours become second nature after a while, and ensure we minimise our electricity bills even further,\" he says. The changes paid off. His total electricity bill for the month of July dropped to just 60 pence, rising to PS4 in November. Powervault was founded by Andrew Woodsworth of Sustainable Venture Development Partners and currently has 16 members of staff. The company has gained funding from angel investors, venture capital investors and three crowdfunding campaigns set up on Crowdcube that attracted donations from PS10 to PS90,000. Another fundraising campaign is planned for later this year, and the investment will support the development of further features for the device, such as second-life recycled batteries to boost its green credentials and reduce running costs. The company is also working with a number of electricity suppliers and utilities including eco-power networks to see how the technology in its clouds can help direct the energy to benefit both the network and the customer.  Powervault is disrupting the energy storage market at an opportune time. The business models of larger utilities have traditionally relied on large centralised power stations and spending billions of pounds to spend on network infrastructure, but industry developments are forcing them to rethink their practices. \"We're getting to the point now where it's going to be cheaper to generate and store electricity locally rather than necessarily buying it from the grid,\" says Warren. \"So there's a general trend towards a more decentralised energy system using smarter technology in people's homes to optimise the use of their battery or the solar panels or electric vehicle.\" He describes Powervault as being both part of the existing ecosystem as well as the new player. This balance between the past and the future is a powerful position for the company as an energy crisis looms. \"We're really in the beginning of a revolution in the way that energy is generated and supplied to people,\" says Warren. \"We think there's a much bigger market opportunity to combine energy storage with smart meters, and that will allow us to achieve our vision of Powervault becoming as commonplace as a washing machine or a dishwasher, and having one in every home, rather than it just being linked to solar PV. \"We're going to be using a lot more electricity in future because as more electric vehicles are rolled out we're going to need to consumer more electricity to power that, and that's going to place a lot of extra demands on the network. It was never designed to have that much put through. We're going to need to look at innovative new ways to help manage those pressures on the grid, and home energy storage is one the key ways of doing that.\" ",

    "title": "How Branch helped UK startup Bloom & Wild with its deep linking issues",
    "content": "It's the day before Valentine's Day and I have forgotten to buy my girlfriend anything. At the top of my inbox I have an email from the flower delivery startup Bloom and Wild offering me a discount code on bouquets and guaranteed delivery for February 14th. I click the link and am taken straight into the mobile app and the discount has already been applied to the products I can see on the screen. How did the startup's backend system know where my order was originating and to apply a discount code without me having to enter it at checkout? That is the work of Branch's deep linking, and it is having a profound effect for marketing teams at some of the world's biggest retail startups. Branch is a tech startup from Silicon Valley that was created when the app developer founders saw how difficult it was to link between channels like web and email to a mobile app, where conversions tend to be higher. The advantage of this is opening up traditional customer acquisition channels to drive mobile app downloads, instead of relying solely on the app store. Accommodation booking giant Airbnb is using Branch links to drive app installs and reported a 19 percent uptick as a result. As Ramsey Pryor, head of international expansion at Branch, told Techworld: \"We have been working on this full time for two and a half years with 50 engineers and although it may seem simple it's not once you look across platforms and every instance. You get a benefit of outsourcing that headache to us.\" In terms of UK customers Branch already has major commercial companies like Notonthehightstreet.com and Skyscanner using its tools to drive more conversions. Branch takes a developer-first approach to user acquisition, similar to Silicon Valley giants like Stripe and Twilio, and relies on its community to spread the word. Once the free SDK is implemented at a company they tend to start leveraging the premium, more marketing-facing tools like deep linked email, smart banner ads and user journey analytics. The Bloom and Wild example above comes from Branch's ability to deep link within email marketing, which is important because 70 percent of email is done on mobile now, according to Branch. Bloom and Wild Flowers cofounder Aron Gelbard told Techworld: \"We realised we wanted to send emails regarding products and to include a call to action to allow users to buy in email, so we wanted that to point to the product in-app if they have the app, and the website if not.\" After this first use case, Bloom and Wild expanded into more sophisticated deep linking to personalise which content customers were landing on and to make applying discount codes more seamless. Gelbard says the company has seen a significant decrease in drop offs at the point where customers had to apply a discount code manually. The startup is also using Branch's deep linking capabilities to gain better attribution insights. Gelbard explained: \"We now use [Branch] when there is no discount code, so by attribution as well. So if you click an adwords link, or an email about Valentine's Day with no discount code we still apply a code with a Branch deep link which hides that code. That enables us to not need to give out as many codes and still track the user.\" Gelbard said that he didn't see a viable alternative on the market to solve his deep linking issues and that he was impressed by Branch's developer ecosystem and standing in the startup community. The company is already looking ahead to Valentine's Day next year, applying data science to improve the user experience further. Gelbard explained: \"We are growing the data science team for personalisation and have started to implement this for different customers, seeing different products, in a different order depending on what the data says is most interesting to them. \"So for Valentine's Day we merchandise differently around previous purchase behaviour to make the process more seamless.\" ",

    "title": "12 reasons your Wi-Fi speed stinks and what you can do about it: How to improve your Wi-Fi speed 2017",
    "content": "Slow Wi-Fi signal can leave even the calmest person ready to throw their router out the window. Here's why your Wi-Fi signal is slow, plus we explain how to speed up your internet connection and boost your Wi-Fi strength and connectivity. Whether you're a small business, a startup relying on as home broadband connection or a company with bigger connectivity needs, read on to boost your Wi-Fi connection...Additional reporting from Sandro Villinger.First you've got to establish the actual speed you're receiving. To do this simply visit a speed testing site, we like Speed Test. From there click begin and it will tell you your upload and download speed. The UK average download speed was around 22.8Mbps last year. The latest Wi-Fi standard is 802.11ac. This standard and the 802.11n are the most desireable for fast connectivity. If your router is either 802.11b or 802.11g standard a new router would definitely boost your Wi-Fi speed and provide a longer range of connectivity. If you've been a loyal customer, most internet providers will send you the newest router for free but others may charge a delivery cost of around PS3-PS6. Here's how to check what Wi-Fi standard you're running on: 1. Click on the Wi-Fi shortcut (usually found on the bottom right of PC screen) 2. Hover your cursor over the broadband service you are using 3. The standard will be listed next to 'Radio Type' The day your router is set up, it automatically detects the least crowded channel and makes that its default. However, with the arrival of new neighbors or offices nearby, the situation may change quickly. All of a sudden, one channel may be used by a handful of routers while others are deserted. There are some great tools that will help determine whether you should change Wi-Fi channel. Software like InSSIDer and NirSoft analyses the entire Wi-Fi spectrum and gives you details about your home network as well as channel usage meaning you can change to a less busy channel. Most internet providers will have step-by-step tutorials on how to do this as procedures can differ. The 2.4GHz frequency is crowded. Not just with neighbors using the same frequency, but also baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens and more. Modern 802.11n and 802.11ac routers offer \"dualband\", which means they're sending two network signals; one at 2.4GHz, and one at 5GHz, which is far less crowded and offers more channels. One drawback is that many device makers only go with the 2.4 GHz receiver. This includes all portable gaming consoles, and also a slew of smartphones. To get a speedy connection activate both networks and connect the mobile devices to the 2.4 GHz network, just enabling the 5GHz network for your laptops and desktops. Sometimes you can't have the luxury of choosing the 5GHz frequency band or selecting a \"lonely\" channel. In such cases, it may be worthwhile to limit your router to sending out signals at intervals of 20MHz. For small businesses with guest Wi-Fi, limit the guest access to 20MHz giving you and your employees a stronger signal with fewer dropouts. An easy, yet often forgotten piece of advice. Make sure that your router's firmware is up-to-date - especially if you've purchased a new one. Expect bandwidth, feature set and resiliency to signals to increase with the first few firmware updates. The latest firmware update can be downloaded from the manufacurer's website and is relatively simple to update as most have a helpful how-to wizard. Sometimes a USB or built in wireless adapter/driver cannot fully communicate with your PC or laptop and updating it could give it the push it needs to get working again. There are a few free tools to make this proccess easier such as Driver Talent which identifies the problem and offers the best downloadable update available for most operating systems. Mac operating systems can find software update solutions on the Apple website. Use a Wi-Fi heatmapping tool to measure the impact of distance, frequency changes and building structures on signal strength. Two tools that are great for this job are NetSpot for Mac and Heatmapper for Windows. Both tools allow you to track Wi-Fi coverage in your office or home. The more points you scan, the more exact your Wi-Fi heatmap. Once you're done, you end up with a map that shows you not just the signal strength but also the throughput of your Wi-Fi network.  Some routers are set up with their \"power savings\" mode on by default. The goal: save a few milliwatts. Unfortunately, this commendable approach reduced bandwidth disproportionately. If you value bandwidth over minimal power savings, check out the router's setting and look for entries called \"Transmission Power\" or various Eco modes. Turn them OFF. Also, do check if your router sports some sort of \"Automatic\" transmission setting. You may want to turn it off and go \"100 percent\" all the time. Unfortunately, the laws of physics sometimes stand in the way of proper wireless bandwidth and signal strength. The distance between your router and the wireless adapter is a more relevant factor than you might think so avoid placing it near thick brick or concrete walls. Placing the router higher up could make a difference to wireless signal. Your Wi-Fi signal can become weak if your PC is too old or too untidy. One way to boost your Wi-Fi speed is to declutter your PC and shed any unnecessary files or programmes that could be slowing it down.  There's plenty of software that claim to speed up your PC and make the general day-to-day running much smoother. We like AVG PC TuneUp, Avast! Cleanup, CCleaner, and F-Secure Booster. For the best tools to clean your PC see: Eight tools that could speed up your PC. If you share your internet connection with people that like to download videos, stream TV shows or play online video games, you might want to consider setting up a few rules. You could suggest that they download content during less popular times. But if you don't fancy any awkward confrontations, there are tools out there that will prioritise apps or programmes. This should result in the most important programmes getting bandwidth priorities.  ",

    "title": "Meet M Squared, the Scottish laser specialists \"selling the shovels\" for the quantum computing gold rush",
    "content": "A small manufacturer of laser technology based out of Glasgow is carving out a niche for itself at the forefront of the quantum computing boom. Traditional laser companies, like Silicon Valley giants Coherent and Toptica, have their hands full with the vast materials processing and manufacturing market for smartphones and computers, allowing M Squared to focus on edge applications like medical research, chemical detection and quantum computing. Dr Graeme Malcolm, CEO and founder of M Squared explained to Techworld that the company was founded with the intention of looking at \"some new themes for where lasers, photonics and quantum technologies would all become important\". M Squared was already selling lasers to many of the labs working on quantum computing, but it wasn't until three years ago that he started to see the potential for the technology to really take off, when he saw the progress being made in the field at institutions like MIT, Harvard and the National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg. Fast forward to 2017 and computing giants like Google and Microsoft are starting to take this area seriously. First though, let's take a step back and look at how quantum computing works, and why lasers are required at all. First, imagine an atom at room temperature shaking around in different directions. What M Squared does is take three pairs of laser beams at different directions to hold the atom in place. The force of the super-pure light uses recoil energy to slow the atom down, cooling it to a millikelvin in temperature, colder than the temperature of deep space.  Once the atom is cool it becomes easier to manipulate the behaviour of the particle and it becomes what Malcolm calls \"a very pure quantum particle\", or what is known in quantum computing as a qubit, the quantum equivalent of a traditional computer bit. In short \"we can now cool the atoms and hold them in arrays where they can become the qubits for quantum computing\", he said. It is at this point that researchers can start to perform some of \"the tricks that [Albert] Einstein and [Werner] Heisenberg were able to do the theory of 100 years ago\", he said. The problem in the past has been scaling these arrays beyond small strings of qubits, which limits the amount of information processing that can be done. This is where it gets a bit technical. Malcolm explained that \"once you have more than one qubit you can create this state called an entanglement where this photon or that photon can be entangled together. So they can become qubits that are zeros and ones and every state in-between zeros and ones.\" This opens each qubit up to store an unprecedented amount of information because it isn't limited by binary logic. Existing quantum computers like the commercially available D-Wave 200Q claims to consist of a lattice of 2000 qubits. Malcolm says that existing players in the market have struggled to maintain entanglement beyond six qubits though, \"so they do lots of little fragments of quantum computing and amalgamate them together, which isn't a scalable quantum computer\".  M Squared instead is looking to create a more \"universal, scalable quantum computer\". Malcolm says it has already provided lasers to the University of Innsbruck in Austria, which has allowed researchers to entangle 50 qubits together in a string, the tipping point where quantum overtakes a traditional supercomputer. Researchers at the university use what they call bra-ket notation to apply quantum algorithms to the system for scientific use cases like researching the quantum qualities of hydrogen bonds and computation-heavy genetics research. Another piece of work M Squared is applying its expertise is in what Malcolm calls \"precision time\". By lining up the cooled atoms into a lattice \"each atom will interact with its neighbour in a well-controlled manner\", he says. By making this lattice vibrate in a controlled environment you can start to develop an extremely accurate measure of time. For example, one M Squared customer, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado has used laser technology to develop an optical-lattice clock which \"is accurate to one second in a million, million, million seconds. Which is longer than the entire lifetime of the universe to date. So they have built a clock that wouldn't have lost a second of time since the start of the universe,\" Malcom explained. This sort of precise timekeeping will prove useful to the financial services industry as it looks for more accurate timestamps for regulatory audits on markets where high-frequency traders are increasingly at play. It is also important for the development of blockchain technology as the audit clock needs to be accurate to ensure the system is as immutable as promised. M Squared wants to help super charge the development of quantum computing and become the backbone to the development of the technology by producing the ion 'traps' required to manipulate atoms in a way that allows users to control the system. \"At a certain point we start to pair lasers up and fine tune the relationship to enable some of these complex multi-qubit systems and putting a control layer over the top,\" Malcolm explained. In practice this looks like a computer chip which has ions lined up along it. This is held in a 'trap' -- or even lots of micro traps -- where lasers on the top and bottom of the unit hold rows of ions in place. This makes the traps 2-3 millimetres in height, instead of around one millimetre in a traditional silicon computer chip. Malcolm believes that they can keep scaling these down though as \"we keep moving the miniaturisation of the laser technology forward\". In terms of price M Squared lasers certainly haven't scaled down to the silicon chip level yet either, with each laser starting at around PS50,000.  Instead of just being usable by a handful of scientific researchers, companies like M Square and D-Wave want to democratise quantum computing in the future. The difference is, M Squared just wants to provide the infrastructure, it doesn't want to solve the memory or coding problems the rest of the industry is grappling with, or build the hardware or software to use it. In theory this could position the Glasgow-based company of around 75 people to become the Intel of the quantum computing boom. Now all it needs is the big bang. ",

    "title": "Everything you need to know about the biggest tech IPO of the year: Snapchat parent company Snap Inc",
    "content": "Snap Inc ($SNAP), the parent company for social media app Snapchat, floated on the US stock exchange yesterday with shares opening at $24 (PS19.62) a share. Shares reached $24.48 (PS20) by market close, a 44 percent jump, valuing the company at $28 billion (PS23 billion). This exceeded all expectations. Snap was reportedly targeting a valuation of between $19.5 billion and $22.3 billion, according to Reuters, before it priced 200 million shares at $17 (PS14) on Wednesday, setting a valuation just short of $24 billion (PS19 billion) and raising an initial $3.4 billion (PS2.8 billion) for the company. That is double Twitter's current market cap of $11.5 billion, making it the biggest tech IPO since Facebook in 2012. For context, Facebook raised around $16 billion (PS13 billion) and was valued at $104 billion (PS84 billion) at the time of its IPO. The cofounders Evan Spiegel (26) and Bobby Murphy (28) made $217 million (PS177 million) each in the IPO.  The sale always had timing on its side after the technology IPO market floundered in 2016, the slowest since 2008, so investors were keen for fresh opportunities. The IPO was unusual in that the cofounders only issued non-voting stock: shares that do not give the holder voting rights at shareholder meetings. This means the cofounders can run the company how they like without listening to stockholders. The pre-IPO S-1 filing stated: \"We are not aware of any other company that has completed an initial public offering of non-voting stock on a U.S. stock exchange.\" Investment managers at top US pension funds were not happy about the no-vote shares in the build up to the IPO, according to the Financial Times. Investors will have to ask themselves if the latest social media float will turn out to be a money-making machine like Facebook, or a floundering mess like Twitter. Snap is going public earlier than either of the other social media giants at only five years old. For context, Facebook held its initial public offering (IPO) in 2012, eight years after being founded, with a peak market capitalisation of over $104 billion and an opening share price of $38. Twitter's IPO in 2013, seven years after founding, opened at $45, at a market capitalisation of $26 billion. This handy chart from Business Insider shows that Snap comes in well below Twitter and Facebook in revenue, losses and daily active users at the time of its IPO. Snapchat says it has 158 million daily active users, far below Facebook's reported 1 billion, and is losing more than $500 million a year at the time of IPO. Where both Snap and Twitter were losing millions of dollars at the point of their IPOs, Facebook was pulling in $1 billion in profit the year before floating. Monetising users should be the key metric for companies like these, but that hasn't stopped investors flocking to Snap stock. Snap Inc describes itself as a camera company in its IPO filing, but it is not yet clear what this means exactly. The filing does admit that Snapchat's first foray into hardware with Spectacles \"has not generated significant revenue\" though. It went on to state: \"We do not have manufacturing capabilities and depend on a single contract manufacturer. If we encounter problems with this contract manufacturer or if the manufacturing process stops or is delayed for any reason, we may not deliver our hardware products, such as Spectacles, to our customers on time, which may seriously harm our business.\"  In the build up to the IPO the New York Times reported that the company is also developing a drone to allow for users to snap overhead footage. In its initial IPO filing with the SEC the risk factors set out for investors ran to 42 pages. This treasure trove of concerns included what I will call 'the Twitter problem': If we are unable to successfully grow our user base and further monetise our products, our business will suffer. In addition to this the filing also seems to admit that Snapchat recognises that its app is hard to grasp for casual users, which would hinder growth. The filing had a series of ten diagrams showing how to navigate the seemingly simple app. It read: These new behaviors, such as swiping and tapping in the Snapchat application, are not always intuitive to users. This can create a lag in adoption of new products and new user additions related to new products. To date, this has not hindered our user growth or engagement, but that may be the result of a large portion of our user base being in a younger demographic and more willing to invest the time to learn to use our products most effectively.  The media-shy cofounders also laid out their concerns around unfavourable press coverage in the document, stating: We and our founders receive a high degree of media coverage globally. Unfavorable publicity regarding us, for example, our privacy practices, product changes, product quality, litigation, or regulatory activity, or regarding the actions of our partners or our users, could seriously harm our reputation. One of the more blunt, and worrying for investors, risk factors states: We have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability. This is a fairly common risk factor in tech S-1 filings, but that doesn't dampen the fact that investors will have to trust that Spiegel can work out how to turn Snap into a profitable company. What this boils down to is that for Snap to be a sound investment you would have to believe that the company is capable of creating more popular products in the future, also known as forecasting future returns on past performance, which tends to be a bad idea. Essentially an investment in Snap, complete with no voting rights, is an investment in Spiegel's genius and your comfort levels with that.  Institutional investors, brokers and the lucky venture capitalists are the winners here, as per, but would I invest some of my journalist salary, using my imaginary stock broker, in Snap stock? Not a chance.  It will be interesting to see if any other tech unicorns look to test the public markets following Snapchat's successful raise.  ",

    "title": "How do startups get investors: tips from founders",
    "content": "A minority of startups are lucky enough to never have to shake down others for cash. Either they are self-funded, or they make enough money from clients from day one. However, for most companies investors are vital to help them get off the ground and subsequently expand. Techworld spoke to entrepreneurs who have been there and done it. We got their advice on how you find investors, how you judge which investor is right for you, and how you then agree terms. Here's what they had to say... The first move is to look at your contacts book. Who do you know, and how can they help you? Nick Katz, cofounder of Splittable, recommends a form of networking called 'spiderwebbing', where you meet entrepreneurs, high net worth people, plus friends and family, pitch them on the business, and try to get them to introduce you to at least two people. Carlos Espinal, partner at Seedcamp, agrees it's worth trying to get introductions: \"A strong and functional relationship is the key to any successful investor-founder engagement. As such, the best way to approach finding investors is through introductions from people you trust.\" You have to pitch to a lot of people so be prepared to deal with rejection during this early phase. This is no bad thing - in fact it helps you to improve, says Katz, who pitched 109 people for his first PS150,000 round just over two years ago and ended up with eight investors. He has since raised PS1.2 million across three rounds. \"Getting 'no's' makes you stronger but importantly, no matter how awesome you are your first pitch will be 1000x worse than the final pitch you deliver to close your round,\" he says. Katz adds: \"This is one of the best reasons to start with friends, family and investors you won't be upset about saying no, i.e. people you think would probably say no, no matter what. Burn some of these investor meetings early!\" It's also worth allotting more time to fundraising than you expect. Katz says it takes \"somewhere between two to four times the amount of time you think it will...you won't close in two months. It's going to take six to nine months for your first round\". You need to do your research, advise ManoMano founders Philippe de Chanville and Christian Raisson. Check investor listings and ratings, look at the types of startups they invest in, keep on top of the latest news within your industry, try to get an introduction from a third party, they suggest. Finally, you should always aim to meet a potential investor in person, not just via phone or email. You should think of an investor as an extension of your team, according to Adam Ludwin, cofounder of Captify. Use their insights, knowledge and experience but \"ultimately take the viewpoint that from day one you will include them in your strategy and growth plans... Listen to your investors and you'll be better poised to avoid damaging pitfalls,\" he says. Ideally you want a mix of investors - some that are supportive and boost your confidence, and others that are more challenging and push you on, says Katz. Colette Ballou, founder of Ballou PR, agrees. \"Look to bring in investors of different genders, races, ages and sexual preferences. Your customers will be diverse so it is important that your investors reflect the company's audience,\" she says. Espinal says there are three simple factors: relationship (can you talk openly together, and could you deal with a crisis?), functional capability (does this investor have the right background to help you?) and focus (does this investor invest at the stage and sector your company is in?). It's worth remembering it is a two-way relationship, so don't be scared to ask investors what they can bring to the table, advises Ballou. \"Do they have expertise in expanding companies into different markets or building a great company culture? Can they help you get follow-on funding?  Ask them directly, take note of their answers and hold them to it,\" she says. Katz offers the following advice: During meetings Katz advises listening carefully, trying to avoid interrupting and suggests adapting your pitch to each individual investor you meet. Get advice from people you trust and who have knowledge of negotiating investment terms - be it entrepreneurs, lawyers or other professionals, suggests Katz. Watch out for \"predatory early stage investors\" he warns - of which there are many. It's worth trying to create competitive tension with multiple, competing offers - but keep it simple. \"Try to be as plain vanilla as you possibly can. The simpler the better. The better, the faster you close,\" he says. It's important to be flexible, advises Colette Ballou. \"For people who can't afford to invest, consider placing them on your advisory board and granting them a small amount of equity,\" she says. Ballou also recommends term limits for advisory board members: \"It's controversial, but consider having one-year term limits for advisory board members - renewable, of course. Why should you be stuck with advisory board members who no longer fit your needs?\" Although it's tempting to be aggressive, remember you'll have to work with an investor for a long time, so find someone you can negotiate a fair deal with, says Espinal. \"Prepare in advance by familiarising yourself with what are standard VC terms...Pick your battles and be knowledgeable about what is standard by also asking other founders of similar type of company and that have received venture backing,\" he adds.

    "title": "Who are the hottest robotics startups in the UK? Meet 13 of the country's best",
    "content": "The UK has provided a loving home for robots ever since Captain Richards & A.H. Reffell built one of the world's first in 1928. \"Eric\" is now reborn following a Kickstarter campaign to bring him back to life and has been given a starring role in a new exhibition at London's Science Museum. The country's startups are ensuring he won't be lonely in future.The robotics market is set to reach $226 billion worldwide by 2021, according to market intelligence company Tractica, more than six times its current value. Research by CB Insights suggests British startups currently account for six percent of the global market, but a growing ecosystem of ambitious visionaries supported by the recently-announced PS17.3 million of funding from the government means many are well-positioned to become world-leaders in the sector. Minimally invasive surgery tends to be a highly expensive procedure, but Cambridge Medical Robotics is developing a next-generation robotic system that could make it affordable and universally accessible. The startup has already successfully tested the performance of the platform on cadavers. The big plans have already attracted big backing. In July 2016, the company raised $20.3 million in a Series A funding round from investors including ABB Technology Ventures, LGT Global Invest and Cambridge Innovation Capital. London-based startup Automata was founded in January 2015 to democratise robotics by lowering costs and improving usability. The company plans to use a robotics-as-a-service (RAAS) business model to integrate robotics into existing workflows more efficiently and to bring automation to new markets. Automata has attracted an undisclosed quantity of funding from ABB Technology Ventures (ATV). Founders Mostafa El Sayed and Suryansh Chandra previously worked as lead designers at Zaha Hadid Architecture, and their first product should be a welcome one in their former profession. The low-cost, plug and play, table-top robotic arm called Eva is ideally suited for design studios, but has been developed to also work in SMEs from a myriad of other industries. University of Sheffield spin-out Consequential Robotics was established to develop companion and assistive robotic systems to enhance quality of life as people age. The first product developed by the startup is a mechanical pet with dog-like features called MiRO that is said to be \"the first robot that thinks like an animal\". MiRo is controlled by technology modelled on the biological brain, and a limited number are currently available to professional researchers for PS1,900 plus tax and shipping. Iconic British designer Sebastian Conran teamed up with the university's Professor Tony Prescott and Dr Ben Mitchinson to found the company in 2016. The research was supported by Innovate UK and it's received funding as part of an EU project. Ai Build wants to develop robotic technologies to support 3D printing in the built environment. The London startup was born in November 2015 and attracted PS75,000 of seed funding from Seedcamp the next year. Founder Daghan Cam envisions a future of construction in which industrial robotics and machine learning automate fabrication processes and help make large-scale 3D printing affordable. Last October the company unveiled the Daedalus Pavilion to showcase the technology's potential. The 5m high and 4.5m wide structure was built using a customised KUKA robotic arm and a 3D printing gun. Bristol-based Reach Robotics is developing monster robots controlled by mobile devices to use with video games. The company has created more than thirty prototypes since it was launched in 2014, but the first design to be released commercially is MekaMon.  The customisable machines are designed to let players engage in combat through augmented reality gaming and are currently available from $275 (PS224).  Reach Robotics has secured a disclosed total of $250,000 (PS200,575) in seed funding so far from seven different investors. Open Bionics designs 3D-printed bionic hands for amputees using medical grade materials. The open source initiative produces devices that are easily reproduced using off-the-shelf materials and teamed up with Disney in 2015 to create a superhero-themed range of prosthetics for children.  The company has received a total of $120,000 (PS96,270) equity funding and $20,000 (PS16,045) seed funding. In February it added $1 million (PS802,100) in prize money after beating more than 1,000 other entrants to the International UAE Robotics for Good Award. The winnings will be used to push the product through the final stages of medical testing before it can be made available to everyone who needs it. Oxfordshire startup Animal Dynamics emerged as a spinout company from the Department of Zoology at Oxford University that builds bio-inspired vehicles using deep science to understand naturally-evolved designs. The team are working to develop a portfolio of products based on research into flight, swimming and walking in the natural world. The company was co-founded by biomechanics professor Dr Adrian Thomas and entrepreneur Alex Cacciain in 2015, and has attracted seed funding from angel investors Oxford Technology and the University of Oxford Isis Fund (UOIF) to build and test its first products and an undisclosed amount of Series A funding. The creators of Moley Robotics claim to have designed the world's first robotic kitchen. The automated chef is operated by a smartphone and combines the standard kitchen equipment of oven, hob and sink with the unusual addition of two dexterous robotic arms that take care of the cooking. The company has raised a total of $1.17 million (PS939,000) in equity crowdfunding since it was founded in 2014. A prototype of the device won the \"Best of the Best\" award at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Shanghai the next year, and a consumer version is set to launch sometime in 2017, supported by an iTunes-style library of different recipes. Primo Toys are designed to help children learn, play and create with technology. Their first release is a wooden robot called Cubetto that helps teach young children how to code through tactile learning. Cubetto is placed atop a map on a floor mat and the child puts coloured blocks on a board that tell the smiling robot where to go.  The company was founded in 2013 by Matteo Loglio and Filippo Yacob to help kids become creators of technology rather than just consumers. They've attracted a total of $1.18 million (PS950,000) in funding so far, from investors including Randi Zuckerberg, the sister of Facebook founder Mark. Cubetto is currently available to buy for $225 (PS180).  London-based startup Emotech has designed what it bills as \"the first personal robot with individual personality.\" The deep-learning capabilities of the voice-controlled device known as \"Olly\" let it adapt to the personality of its user over time through daily interactions. The technology won the creators four different CES Innovation Awards in 2017. The robotics startup was founded in August 2014 to explore ways of improving the relationships between people and technology and has already secured $10 million (PS8 million) of Series A funding from Alliance Capital and Lightning Capital, plus an undisclosed amount of angel funding. Serial entrepreneur Tom Lipinski developed Q-Bot after he uncovered a problem with laying floor insulation in older homes while working on a previous project aimed at reducing domestic energy use. Q-Bot is his solution. The tiny four-wheeled robot is inserted through an air vent armed with a 3D scanner and insulating foam to survey the underside of floorboards and apply insulation as required. Q-Bot was founded in 2012 and won best startup at the Invention and Entrepreneurship in Robotics and Automation Awards in Seattle in 2015. The system has been trialled with clients including Camden Council and CityWest Homes, and the company claims it can save between PS200 and PS300 a year in energy bills. A total of PS2 million has been invested in Q-Bot from the EU Horizon 2020 Programme and two rounds of seed funding. Starship Technologies develops small self-driving robots designed to deliver goods locally within 30 minutes. The electric six-wheeled personal couriers drive on pavements at a pedestrian speed of four miles per hour to the location of the customer who then unlock the delivery using their personal code. The startup is headquartered in London but its engineering operations are based in Estonia. Skype co-founders Janus Friis and Ahti Heinla created the company in 2015 and have gained $17.2 million (PS13.8 million) of funding from eight investors including HOF Capital and Playfair Capital. Dr Alexander Enoch developed his idea for Robotical while working with bulky machines during his PhD in Robotics studies at the University of Edinburgh. The compact bipedal robot called Marty harnesses the power of play to teach computer skills to children by letting them reprogramme the device and customise its 3D-printed parts. The company has received funding from the the Royal Academy of Engineering's Enterprise Hub and more than PS86,000 on a crowdfunding platform. Marty is currently available at a special pre-order price of PS99 plus shipping. ",

    "title": "15 UK Healthtech Startups to Watch: From patient apps to genomics startups",
    "content": "Healthtech is a vast sector spanning biotech, life sciences and medtech. A healthtech startup could be developing consumer-facing apps to help book NHS appointments, better technology for clinician workflows or even using machine learning to work through genomics data to boost drug discovery programmes.Back in 2014 the Mayor of London Boris Johnson launched MedCity, a joint programme between academic powerhouses Imperial, Kings College London, UCL, Oxford and Cambridge universities to build a life sciences cluster in the south east of England.At the time Johnson hit upon the diversity of the sector, saying: \"Together with Oxford and Cambridge we form a 'golden triangle' of scientific innovation and we need to channel that intellectual pre-eminence into a positive impact on our economy. MedCity will span everything from research to clinical trials to manufacturing, across biotech, medtech and healthtech.\"The current Mayor Sadiq Khan has also backed healthtech with the digitalhealth.london accelerator scheme, which is currently helping 32 companies design technology solutions for the NHS.Here are just some of the UK's best healthtech startups to watch...Babylon Health is an app which uses machine learning to connect patients with doctors. You can input your symptoms, upload a photo and it accesses NHS data to set up a phone or video consultation at a time which suits you.  The app also has an AI powered chatbot which allows you to ask medical questions 24/7, a feature which allows you to get prescriptions delivered to your nearest pharmacy. It even doubles up as a health monitoring app which can be synced with your wearable devices. Babylon Health is free but you will be charged for time spent talking to a GP, with unlimited GP access charged at PS5 a month or PS25 per consultation and more for specialist and therapist appointments. Babylon already works with the NHS and raised a $60 million (PS47 million) in funding from NNS holdings, Vostok New Ventures and returned investors Kinnevik AB. This follows a $25 million (PS20 million) round last year led by Swedish investors Kinnevik and including investment from DeepMind co-founders Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman. BenevolentAI is applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to the genomics space, with two business units: Benevolent Bio, which focuses on drug discovery, and BenevolentTech, which is more of a research institution looking at the application of AI to genomic data. The startup's aim is to expedite the traditional drug research process by ingesting huge amounts of data and literature using proprietary algorithms and NVIDIA's DGX-1 deep learning supercomputer. BenevolentAI then builds tools on top to match the workflow of drug discovery scientists so that they can easily mine and interrogate the data, ideally reducing the time to market for important drugs. The existing drug development process can take at least fifteen years, costs upwards of tens of billions of dollars and is high risk, according to BenevolentBio CEO Jackie Hunter. \"Most people in the pharmaceutical industry work on things that never make it to market or even to man,\" she told Techworld.  BenevolentAI is one of the best funded healthtech startups in the UK, bringing in a massive Series A round of PS72 million in a single undisclosed round. Echo is a free app which allows you to order repeat prescriptions to your door. You just tell Echo what prescription you need and where your local GP is. It partners with NHS Digital to plug into the various systems needed to verify these details. It is then delivered to your door by first class Royal Mail, for free. The app reminds you to reorder, when to check in with the GP and even when to take your medicine. So how does it offer all of this for free? Co-founder Stephen Bourke explained to Techworld that Echo essentially works like a \"Deliveroo for prescriptions\", in that it takes a cut of the gross profit a pharmacy makes from the NHS drug tariffs it receives to distribute medicine. Echo has raised a PS1.8 million seed round led by LocalGlobe in November 2016 and was selected for the TechCity UK Upscale programme in January 2017. Launched last year, Thriva sends out a finger-prick blood testing kit which monitors your baseline health and offers lifestyle advice to improve general wellness over time. CEO Hamish Grierson realises the recent debacle of US startup Theranos over-promising what it could test for from a simple finger-prick test may have dented consumer trust in this area, but tells Techworld that Thriva does things differently. \"The first thing is that Theranos are and were trying to develop proprietary testing hardware, so machinery that analyses blood testing, and we are not doing that,\" he said. \"For the reason Theranos encountered around accuracy and trust we are using tried and tested and accepted lab capabilities that the NHS themselves use frequently.\" The baseline test tracks cholesterol, liver function, iron levels and vitamin D and costs PS49 per test, with a recommendation to get tested every three months. The information is then put out to a network of GPs that provide commentary and lifestyle advice which is sent to the user on an online dashboard. \"Thriva is about empowering people to proactively manage their health and make better decisions as a consequence,\" Grierson said. Grierson would like to expand the amount of tests Thriva can run to include urine and DNA. \"We are creating a platform for internal testing. It doesn't really matter what type of biomarker you want to test for we will make it easy and affordable and that's the plan,\" Grierson said. He is also looking to build upon the rich data Thriva is collecting to push predictive insights. Thriva is based in the Huckletree shared working space in Shoreditch and raised an undisclosed funding round in June last year. Andiamo is a startup with an incredibly sad founding story. Naveed and Samiya Parvez came up with the idea following the death of their child Diamo - who had cerebral palsy - in 2012. Diamo's death made the parents spot a gap in the market for tech-enabled orthotics, taking advantage of the lower barriers to entry for 3D printing to produce bespoke braces and orthotics for children.  The startup has got the attention of Sir Richard Branson and is in conversations with the NHS. However Parvez told Techworld in 2015: \"There is not a lack of funding but a lack of imagination. Risk capital is going to iterations of the same ideas with minor tweaks.\" London and New York-based Touch Surgery wants to help train surgeons through a 3D simulation app. The app was created by a group of plastic surgeons who saw a gap in the way the NHS trained surgeons that would be more cost effective than using cadavers. The app gives trainees simulated surgeries from which they can learn and practice as well as tips, advice and feedback. It is already being used by medical students at Imperial College London. Touch Surgery raised a $1 million (PS800,000) seed round led by Episode 1 in 2014. iamYiam is a UK healthtech startup founded by former venture capitalist Lorena Puica after she developed a thyroid condition and wanted to promote a more preventative approach to healthcare. You start by taking a saliva DNA test from Xcode, which is sent in the post. This tests for forty parameters and \"enable us to understand how you process nutrients, respond to certain activities, any pre-disposition to diabetes or slow metabolism\", says Puica. The iamYiam algorithms then match you to therapists and a personalised nutritional plan. Puica says she wants to do more machine learning work on the patient data they collect to improve the matching algorithms and better predict effective healthcare plans. The startup is focusing on attracting corporate clients and has raised angel investment so far with a PS2 million round planned for this year, with Puica's ex-employer Octopus Investments involved. Vida is a home care service which uses technology to match carers to patients and deliver personalised care programmes. You start by setting up a care assessment through the Vida website, after which its algorithms will align the patient's needs to carer skills. The carer will then provide a personalised care plan for a flat fee of PS15 per hour of care. Founder Naushard Jabir is a former mergers and acquisitions analyst turned entrepreneur that started Vida in May 2016. Vida already has a spot contract with the Kingston local authority and a spokesperson for the startup told Techworld: \"We're speaking with a number of other local councils throughout London\". Vida is currently funded by an unnamed group of angel investors. Founded in 2012, Umotif focuses on bringing high quality patient data to doctors and clinical researchers. For patients Umotif is a way of capturing timely and accurate symptom, medication and wearable data in an engaging mobile app format. So as opposed to unreliable paper diaries or weekly appointments with the doctor it is bringing more timely data into the equation, which will improve patient care and data quality for researchers. For doctors and clinical researchers it is a white label Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product, providing a secure patient data source which is accessible through a web portal, complete with dashboards. All data is HIPAA (USA) and Information Governance (UK) compliant and is stored in the cloud with AWS. The startup has raised some seed capital previously and has already had its services procured by NHS Digital and major pharmaceutical companies. It is working with a number of hospitals and clinical trials, such as the recent successful trial for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Doctify, similar to Babylon Health, is a healthcare platform that allows patients to search, compare and book appointments with specialists across 47 medical areas, and includes reviews from other users. The startup was launched by two practicing NHS doctors: Dr Stephanie Eltz and Dr Suman Saha. Doctify raised an undisclosed Series A round led by Amadeus Capital Partners in October 2016. Conceived by Cambridge graduates Victor Dillard and Edward Perello in 2012, Desktop Genetics aims to help people interrogate the CRISPR genomics database, using artificial intelligence (AI) to simplify the process for researchers. Desktop Genetics' Deskgen cloud platform essentially guides researchers through the genome editing process. There are also CRISPR libraries for advanced users. The startup has raised $3.2 million (PS2.6 million) to date from a variety of investors. Big Health is targeting mental health with its \"digital medicine\" non-drug programmes, starting with its first solution, the online app Sleepio. Sleep is a good indicator of mental health and the app starts by monitoring sleep patterns, provides a sleep score and delivers guides to improvement. For certain cases Sleepio will recommend Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, tailored to each individual's needs by a virtual expert. Big Health works with employers to improve the general mental health of employees, including media company Comcast and LinkedIn. The startup also has a research arm looking into mental health issues. Big Health was founded by Colin Espie, a professor of sleep medicine at Oxford University and NHS innovation fellow Peter Hames. It has good investor pedigree too, raising $15.3 million (PS12.4 million) to date led by Index Ventures in Series A and Octopus Ventures in Series B. Health Unlocked is an online community for people to share their health experiences with others, ask for advice and receive support. Instead of those terrifying Google results, users can ask real people that have suffered from certain illnesses questions and receive useful advice. Popular groups include anxiety support and lifestyle changes, for example smokers looking to quit, running and weight loss communities. The startup describes itself as the social network for health, with more than 600,000 members and 40 million visits a year. The startup partners with patient advocacy organisations, providing them with access to its audience and also offers a range of commercial services, including patient insights. Health Unlocked is part of the NHS Innovation Accelerator programme. Founded in 2010 by Pablo Graiver, Dr. Jessica Mann and Dr. Eithan Ephrati, Antidote is a platform for connecting patients with medical researchers. You simply input information (condition, location, age, sex) and Antidote will suggest clinical trials that you can participate in. Researchers get access to more patients, accelerating their research. Antidote has taken clinical trail information and made it machine readable, allowing the startup to better match patients to the right trials using its algorithms. Antidote has raised $17.9 million (PS14.3m) to date, led by Amadeus Capital Partners (Seed $1.25m); Octopus Ventures (Series A $3.2m); Smedvig Capital (Series B $13.5m). Cambridge-based DuoFertility is combining software and hardware to help couples to conceive. The startup combines a mobile app with a small wearable sensor which monitors ovulation. Using customer data, DuoFertility's algorithms learn about fertility cycles and help identify fertility windows up to ten days ahead of time. The startup will pair you off with a fertility expert to provide a personalised support plan according to your data. Three months of the service will set you back PS359.99 for three months, which includes a consultation and the sensor. The DuoFertility maker Sensiia has received around $9 million (PS7.2 million) in total funding to date, with the most recent round in 2014 led by Longwall Venture Partners. ",

    "title": "Latest Facebook news and announcements: Everything you need to know",
    "content": "Keeping up with Facebook's latest news can be tough. But don't panic, we've listed all the important stuff you'll need to know about Facebook's biggest and most recent announcements.Read on for Facebook's biggest announcements...This week, money transfer firm TransferWise announced its integration with Facebook's Messenger app, enabling users to transfer money internationally.  Launched as a chatbot, this service will guide Facebook users through the process of transferring money and even notify them when the best time is to exchange money.  The bot is available in the U.S, Canada, Australia and Europe. In February 2017, Facebook launched a tool allowing businesses in the U.S. and Canada to create job postings through their Facebook Pages. In an attempt to take on Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, Facebook's new tool is aimed at small businesses and will enable potential candidates to respond to a job posting directly from the social network.  The initial ad will be totally free to the employer but those wanting to boost the post to gain more exposure, like any Facebook ad, will be charged. Last year, Facebook launched a 'unified inbox' for businesses using Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. This new feature will provide one application for businesses to keep on top of Facebook, Messenger and Instagram conversations. The unified channel will hold conversations on businesses' Facebook posts, posts on pages and messages and comments on Instagram. Facebook's unified inbox is being tested with specific organisations with the aim to roll it out to the wider audience in the coming months. Facebook has launched Marketplace, a Gumtree and eBay-style application letting people buy and sell items locally. In a blog post, Director of Product Management Mary Ku said: \"Facebook is where people connect, and in recent years more people have been using Facebook to connect in another way: buying and selling with each other. \"More than 450 million people visit buy and sell groups each month -- from families in a local neighborhood to collectors around the world,\" Ku added. Debuting in the US, the UK, Australia and New Zealand first, Facebook's new Marketplace smartphone app should be available in the coming days with a desktop application expected later in the year. First introduced at Facebook's F8 conference earlier this year, Facebook's Profile Expression Kit now enables all developers to create and share photos and videos created in third-party apps on Facebook profiles.  For example, via Boomerang, Facebook profiles can house a profile photo videos rather than static photos.  Other integrated apps include MSQRD, BeautyPlus, Lollicam, Flixel Cinemagraph Pro and Vine. At its 2016 F8 conference, Facebook announced that businesses will now be able to provide chatbots to deliver automated customer support.  Developers and companies alike will be able to access Facebook Live's API, meaning live videos could become increasingly popular this year. Last year, Facebook announced Surround 360 - an open-source VR camera. This was great news for developers that want to build their own and for future Oculus Rift owners. In 2016, Facebook's Send and Receive API allows developers to create their own messenger chatbots for basic businesses responses to more specialised bots. For customers already engaged with a brand, last year Facebook started pushing messaging ads to reconnect with consumers.  Announced in 2016, this kit will enable Facebook users to have video profile photos recorded from third-party apps. Account Kit is plug-in for developers to help businesses grow and monetise from their apps via push notifications and bigger push campaigns.  Facebook announced (12 April 2016) that Dropbox would be integrated with Facebook messenger, enabling users to send and preview Dropbox files. This announcement comes a week ahead of its F8 conference which is expected to bring many more updates and new features to both the messenger and Facebook app.  According to The Next Web, Facebook is helping blind people 'see' photos by using artificial intelligence to narrate them via its iOS app. By using neural networks, the Facebook app will generate a description for every photo e.g. 'three women smiling with champagne'. Lat year, Facebook added five new emotions buttons. Love, anger, haha, sad and wow have joined the 'like' button to respond to friends posts.  If you're using Facebook on a laptop or PC just hover over the 'like' button to choose your emotion and if using the Facebook app on your phone, hold down the 'like' button to reveal the latest five emotions.  Last year, Facebook reportedly changed its newsfeed algorithm to puts stories you want to see at the top of your newsfeed. Facebook will use posts you usually like, comment on or share to determine what users would like to see at the top of their newsfeed when they login. While we all know Facebook regularly makes changes to its newsfeed in a bid to perfect it, this change could improve the newsfeed user experience. In 2016, Facebook reported that it would close its mobile development platform Parse in 2017 to focus efforts on other projects. Facebook bought Parse in 2013 and had customers such as Quip and Orbitz, according to the New York Times.  Facebook are reportedly open-sourcing the Parse server and offering a migration tool to help integrated apps migrate to other platforms.  Last year Facebook launched a professional network. The platform, 'Workplace by Facebook' aims to keep the look and user experience of the usual Facebook newsfeed with chat capabilities and likes and comments. Facebook also blocks game requests according to reports. Last year it was reported that Facebook is testing a new feature to help users get over a nasty break-up. Facebook will hide statuses from exes and their name won't appear when tagging someone in a photo or status. Facebook added 'Music Stories' to users' timelines. This feature allows users to listen to thirty seconds of songs and albums from Spotify and Apple Music. This service is currently only available on the Facebook iOS app. It was reported in 2015 that Facebook was launching a breaking news app. The app will be called Notify and will provide real-time news updates. Facebook announced a feature enabling its users to connect with others they may not already be 'friends' with. Facebook can send notifications alerting users of new messages to be either ignored or responded to. Previously, these messages were sent to the 'other' folder within the inbox and for most of us, never seen. Last year, Facebook allegedly tested real-time sport updates to be delivered right to your phone. It's reported that users will be able to subscribe to receive updates that will appear within the messenger app. New developer tools can integrate GIFs, photos, videos and audio clips in the Messenger tool. Zuckerberg also revealed that businesses will be able to integrate with Messenger as a way to speak to its customers - similar to how firms deal with complaints or FAQs over Twitter. Developers have been given a dashboard to measure how people are using their apps so they can better understand their devices, allowing them to tailor their marketing campaigns to ensure their app takes off.  Video and display ad revenues for mobile app publishers can be managed through LiveRail's monetisation platform. This means developers can follow Facebook's method of providing personalised advertising.  In 2015, a new line of IoT Parse SDKs were announced, starting with one specifically for Arduino Yun - a wifi-enabled makerboard that helps connect inanimate objects to smartphones. Parse's founder Ilyar Sukhar gave a nod to a smart garage door manufacturer that built a door that can be unlocked through a smartphone through Parse.  Facebook's chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer announced in 2015, several open sourced designs for its infrastructure that developers can use. Firstly, an iOS version of React Native - which allows developers to build Ios AND Android UIs without a browser or WebView has been opened up on Github. In addition, Fresco, Component Kit, Year Class and Connection class have been open sourced and Nuclide is set to follow.   Facebook's artificial intelligence experts have already proved influential through their recent research publications. But the F8 developer conference showcased one of their most recent technologies, Memory Networks, which showed a machine able to answer sophisticated questions about a Lord of the Rings synopsis.  ",

    "title": "Meet Hire Space: the tech startup transforming the events industry",
    "content": "The UK events sector is worth about PS40 billion a year, but it is still a remarkably traditional 'offline' industry based on relationships between individuals. That's something one startup is slowly starting to change. Hire Space, an online marketplace for venues, was launched three years ago by two friends: Edward Poland and Will Swannell. Neither had any experience in events or venues. Swannell was a secondary school teacher and Poland worked for an MP. The idea came to Swannell when he realised how many schools sit empty after hours. The startup was originally conceived as a way to help underused public sector buildings, struggling with austerity, to bring in another revenue stream, Poland tells Techworld. It has since become far wider in scope, with 5,000 venues across the UK listed and another 100 added every month. The site hosts an eclectic mix of spaces from the London Eye and the Olympic Velodrome to Hampton Court Palace and Shakespeare's Globe. The startup employs 40 staff and the majority of its users work in the professional events business organising conferences, parties, weddings and meetings, according to Poland. \"We have an incredible team. They could run the business. And they free me up to have the luxury of thinking about big strategic questions,\" he says.  \"We wanted it to be a transactional platform letting people book a venue in a few clicks. We wanted it to be website first,\" he explains. The company has now raised PS2.5 million in total, including PS500,000 from crowdfunding platform Crowdcube and early angel investment from Karen Hanton, founder of restaurant booker TopTable. Hire Space is free for users but takes commission from venues (apart from public sector spaces, which are allowed to list for free).   Poland hopes Hire Space's data might help provide insights into the events industry. \"Last year we had about 25,000 enquiries and 4.5 million page views on the site. That's great insight, so we will release a report based on the data,\" he says. \"We are very new to this sector. Our competitors' main reaction has been to be baffled, confused or fearful,\" Poland adds. The company's relative youth is no bar to ambition however. Looking ahead, Poland says he is considering expanding overseas and growing the range of services offered. \"There is enormous potential for Hire Space. We get people at the start of the event planning cycle. We could even become a full events marketplace. We're in a position where we are thinking about what's next,\" he says. ",

    "title": "Snapchat IPO: Here's what tech firms should know about going public",
    "content": "Snap Inc. is aiming to raise $3bn at a $25bn valuation through an IPO. Whilst many IPOs \"pop\" on their first day of trading, Snap (the company behind Snapchat) may well be a \"flop\". Snap is being censured by institutional investors with respect to its corporate governance and analysts are expressing concerns over its financials and stagnant growth. This article looks at some of the challenges companies face going into an IPO. The biggest mistake most CEOs make is that they misunderstand what an IPO is. An IPO is a financing event and a recapitalisation - it is not a liquidity event. Directors need to be clear on what the objectives of the IPO are (i.e. is the money to be used for future expansion, shareholder liquidity, enhance market standing, etc.). The purpose of the IPO will inform the deal structure, the likely identity of the investors in the IPO and the desired valuation. The jurisdiction in which a company is incorporated or in which it does the bulk of its business may not always be the best jurisdiction in which to float. Different markets have different regulatory requirements, investor bases and liquidity levels. AIM is relatively light touch from a regulatory/compliance perspective and offers access to certain funds however it can suffer from a lack of liquidity. NASDAQ may offer greater liquidity and the possibility of achieving a better valuation, but is more burdensome from a compliance perspective and will be more costly (particularly for a UK company). Essentially, an IPO is a sales pitch. Any company preparing for an IPO needs to set out what differentiates them from their peers, where the company is now and where it is going, where the company sits in the market and what the proceeds will be used for. Very few companies are suitable candidates for IPO - they either have to be mature companies with steady revenue streams or companies with high growth potential. Going into an IPO process, many companies will need to seriously look at their finance function. This is important both going into the process as well as ensuring that the company has the resources to meet its compliance obligations post-IPO. A company will need to provide audited financial for the last three years. Any unaudited accounts will need to be converted and updated to include all relevant public company disclosures. This exercise can divert a lot of management time and it is important that the finance function has sufficient resources in order to manage this. An IPO can bring unwanted attention. If you look at the IPOs of Wolfson Microelectronics, Twitter and Facebook they were all subject to pre-IPO litigation. In each instance, this was litigation designed to frustrate or hamper the IPO. Not only is such litigation unwelcome PR, but it can also divert a lot of management time from both the IPO process and running the business. Part of the equity story (as well as ensuring that the company meets certain corporate governance standards) is the management team. Public market investors want to ensure that the management team have the right technical, qualifications, skills and experience. Any company wishing to IPO should review their board composition to ensure that they have the right personnel. Finding the right candidates and properly integrating them can be time consuming. Any company wanting to IPO has to act as a public company. Board meetings will need to be properly formalised and relevant board committees (i.e. audit, remuneration and nomination committees need to be put in place). The company will also need to ensure that it is in compliance with any relevant codes of practice. Last of all, companies need to note that the IPO market is cyclical, it may not always be open, even for the most suitable prospects. Also, even when the IPO markets are open, there are still times during in a year when it will be impossible to get anything anyway - this is important as slippages in the timetable can disproportionately impact the timing of the IPO.

    "title": "Meet Brolly, the UK Insurtech startup using AI to 'fundamentally change' the insurance industry",
    "content": "Brolly may have only graduated from incubator Entrepreneur First in September, but this startup already has ambitious plans to give customers a single place to view, manage and buy insurance from their mobile. To really shake up an industry rife with inertia and outdated products Phoebe Hugh, cofounder and CEO at Brolly, aims to go back to the days where your insurance broker knew what you needed and helped you to manage an insurance portfolio, before the days of price comparison sites and online portals. Instead of connecting you with a human broker though, Brolly uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Hugh, a psychology graduate from the University of Manchester, left her job at insurance giant Aviva in March 2015 and enrolled in the prestigious Entrepreneur First programme, joining the sixth cohort a year later in March 2016. There she met her cofounder, CTO Mykhailo Loginov. She had become jaded by an industry that only ever seemed to \"unlock a whole host of frustrations\" in customers, and which had not yet produced a successful new consumer brand or startup focusing on doing things differently.  Hugh explained that before the internet all insurance was managed by brokers \"who would manage everything\". \"The products haven't changed. So people end up not getting advice anymore, they are trying to figure stuff out and end up under insured or buy stuff they don't need.\" In short: management of insurance policies has become fatally fragmented, \"so there is no portfolio visually. Everything comes through your email or paper or an online portal, there is no join up,\" she told Techworld. \"The biggest issue that results from that is inertia, so you end up leaving things and you end up paying double, because you aren't rewarded for loyalty, you are reprimanded. This is characteristic of how the market is today and what we wanted to do at Brolly was cut through that.\" The first step was getting an app off the ground. This soon became three interlocking products, all housed in the Brolly app. In Hugh's words: \"The app originally was designed to focus on the biggest issues consumers were facing, and we grouped them into: understanding insurance, managing insurance and buying insurance.\" These became the Brolly Advisor, Locker and Shop.  With the advisor Hugh wanted \"to create an advisor which based on what you put in you get valuable output to help you understand where you might have gaps in cover\". In practice you provide the app with information such as lifestyle and financial attributes, and then give the app access to your inbox so that it can scrape your existing policy documents into the locker. Now the algorithm takes over and \"spots where you have gaps, like income protection insurance, explains what it is and asks would you like to get a quote?\" The locker is \"the hub, it's where customers manage everything they have and anything they buy goes in there and anything that isn't they can be advised on\". In the locker customers can access documents, contact providers, see how much they are paying and upcoming renewal dates. Any gaps can be advised upon and then, once it comes online later this year, products can be bought in the shop. The last piece of the puzzle is the shop, which Hugh says is the most demanded feature. It is currently being tested with beta customers and is set to become available to the public in the summer. Brolly will start by offering home, motor and travel, with more product lines to come. Hugh wants the shop to be \"extremely fast and fully self service, so a couple of taps to get your policy. It is about convenience, there is not a huge focus on getting the cheapest policy, it is more customers that value quality products and want a fast way to buy something outright\". The shop will also learn more about you and even \"if they don't need a quote today it gives us the ability to look around in the background to push notifications to the user to suggest the best time to switch, so it is trying to be that proactive advisor in someone's pocket,\" Hugh summarised. Brolly will take a commission on any products it sells through the app and the insurance providers in exchange get access to high quality customers, according to Hugh. \"Due to the relationship we are building with our customers we really have a deep understanding of their lives, we know this homeowner has two cars and children and likes to travel and it is delivering an entire holistic person and insurers see tremendous value in being able to tap into good quality risk and stripping out fraud,\" she said. This personal profile isn't handed over to the insurer but is anonymised. Hugh explained: \"Pricing today is focused on product lines not the individual, and it is using actuarial models rather than holistic pictures of people. \"So an actuarial model for the entire customer base whereas we use machine learning techniques to get right down to personalised risk models. That is where the value of our data lies.\" She added the Brolly platform is poised to incorporate data from wearable devices and car telematics in the future too. Insurtech is set for a bumper year, with KPMG already predicting that 2017 is the year the nascent industry will \"come into its own\". If Brolly is going to take advantage of this it will need to get the shop up and running and ramp up customer acquisition. Hugh is already looking at the ways UK challenger banks have taken a transparent, community-first approach to get early adopters on board. Brolly will almost certainly have to contend with a raft of imitators soon enough. To date Hugh believes that most startups have focused on smaller pieces of the puzzle than an all-in-one solution. The question will be if Brolly has bitten off more than it can chew. \n\n\n\n(function(){\nvar params = {};\nwindow.setupVideoCustomParams = function(){\nif(typeof window.pageVideoCustomParams !== 'undefined'){\nreturn;\n}\nvar pubAds = googletag.pubads();\nfor(var prop in pubAds){\nif(prop.length===1 && Object.prototype.toString.call(pubAds[prop]) === \"[object Object]\" ){ //why not use typeof??\nvar adsAttrObj = pubAds[prop];\nif(\"URL\" in adsAttrObj){\nfor (var key in adsAttrObj) {\nswitch (key) {\ncase \"pcat1\":\ncase \"pcat2\":\ncase \"pcat3\":\ncase \"kw\":\ncase \"artid\":\nparams['video-'+key] = adsAttrObj[key];\nbreak;\ncase \"chan\":\nparams['video-channel'] = adsAttrObj[key];\nbreak;\n}\n}\nbreak;\n}\n}\n}\nwindow.pageVideoCustomParams = params;\n}\ngoogletag.cmd.push(setupVideoCustomParams);\n})();\nrequire(['jquery', 'jwplayer'], function($,jwplayer){\nif (typeof window.jwplayer === 'undefined') {\nwindow.jwplayer = jwplayer;\n}\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function(){\nvar timestamp = new Date().getTime(),\nadvertisingTag = \"\" + adConfig.zone + \"&sz=640x480&ciu_szs=&unviewed_position_start=1&output=xml_vast2&impl=s&env=vp&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=0&vad_type=linear&vpos=preroll&pod=1&min_ad_duration=0&max_ad_duration=30000&ppos=1&\",\ncust_params = {\n\"playertype\": 'clicktoplay',\n\"video-id\": \"3656945\",\n\"stg\": \"false\"\n};\nif(typeof window.pageVideoCustomParams === 'undefined'){\nwindow.setupVideoCustomParams();\n}\n$.extend(cust_params, window.pageVideoCustomParams);\nvar cust_params_url = '';\nvar prevQuality;\nfor(var paramKey in cust_params){\nvar paramValue = cust_params[paramKey],\ndelimiter = cust_params_url.length > 0 ?

    "title": "Level39's Ben Brabyn on his plans for Europe's largest technology accelerator",
    "content": "Canary Wharf has a chequered past. It went from being one of the busiest docks in the world to being deserted by 1980, before reinvention as a business district, with the first buildings completed in 1991. The construction company then promptly went bankrupt and in December 1995 an international consortium bought the scheme. That consortium became the Canary Wharf Group. It is this PS5 billion company that owns Level39, Europe's largest technology accelerator, located on the 39th floor of One Canada Square (it has since expanded to include levels 24 and 42). Level39 opened in March 2013 and has since grown to house more than 200 startups with about 900 people between them, according to Ben Brabyn, who took over the reins in February 2016. He was previously COO of UKTI's 'Innovation Gateway', having worked with JP Morgan after a stint as a captain in the Royal Marines.  The accelerator doesn't take equity in any of the companies it hosts. It offers membership packages for desks, meeting rooms and other amenities starting from PS325 a month.  It's clearly a model that's working: a brief tour reveals rooms packed with people typing into laptops, taking calls, holding meetings and getting coffee. It's a hive of activity. \"We don't have time limits, a deadline or a demo day. We don't take equity or behave like investors. We treat all as best we can, with the same price for a desk for everyone. We are not picking winners,\" Brabyn tells Techworld. The accelerator has a wide variety of specialisms, including fintech, cyber security, smart cities and retail tech. \"We're more a meta accelerator really, we don't do any one thing - and we host a lot of others' accelerators, including UBS, Accenture, EY and Silk Ventures, who are helping the Chinese to engage here. Increasingly we are a team of teams, a host of centres of excellence rather than one in our own right,\" he adds. Level39's genesis lies in the 2008 financial crash. \"There's been a focus on diversification [beyond solely the finance sector] in Canary Wharf since then, led by Sir George Iacobescu [CEO of Canary Wharf Group],\" he says. Of the 120,000 people that work in the area, less than half of them now work in finance, compared to 80 percent in 2010, according to Brabyn. Level39 is part of this wider push to diversify Canary Wharf, and to try to provide more support for earlier stage companies, not just the vast multinationals that the area is so famous for. \"Within five minutes from here we've got 30 percent of banks' IT budgets. We can provide access to customers, capital, talent, regulators and government bodies, and deep sectoral knowledge,\" Brabyn enthuses. There is also a growing academic presence: UCL has moved its School of Management postgraduate programme onto the 38th floor below, for example. Of the startups within Level39, the soaraway success is Digital Shadows, a cyber security company with 75 employees which works with big names like the NSA and the Bank of England, and has offices in the US as well as UK. However there is a dizzying array of early-stage companies based there: Revolut, dopay, MapR, OpenCorporates, Coinjar, DigitalGenius and Credits, to name but a tiny few.  Looking ahead to 2017, Brabyn says his focus will be on ensuring access to talent post-Brexit and international expansion.   \"Level39 is scaling up now. We're taking over three floors. We're going from a startup to a scale up ourselves,\" Brabyn says. On that ever-present topic, Brexit, Brabyn refuses to be downbeat. He approaches the topic in as upbeat a manner as everything else: \"Let's focus on what we can do, not what we can't\", he says.  ",

    "title": "These 9 UK fashion tech startups will help you dress better",
    "content": "As more and more shoppers purchase their clothes online the fashion industry is having to adopt technology at a faster rate than ever.These eight startups are bringing big data analytics, facial recognition and 3D technologies together with retailers to help you shop and dress better.Lyst is an e-commerce platform that brings together more than 11,000 fashion brands and retailers, allowing shoppers to use a single shopping basket, instead of clicking out to each individual retailer's websites. So how does it differ to an e-commerce site like ASOS? PR manager Katy Lubin told Techworld:  \"Scale and size, we have more stuff than anyone else with over three million products from 11,000+ brands and retailers. Insight, we have a data science and analytics team that are looking at 4.5 million changing data points every hour, such as new products dropping, new stock, changes in pricing etcetera, which give us the ability to build up a picture of how the world is shopping in real time. Lastly authority, we work with all of the best partners around the world, such as Saks in the USA and Selfridges here in London.\" Lyst is one of the better established names on this list (no pun intended), featuring in TechcityUK's Future 50 and it has already pulled in more than PS42 million in funding from the likes of Groupe Arnault, Accel Partners and Balderton Capital. Kieran O'Neill founded Thread in 2012 with the aim of helping men dress better through combining personal online stylists with big data insights. You start out by telling the platform some of your fashion preferences (do you wear skinny jeans or bootcut) and how much you tend to spend on clothes, what size you wear and some of your favourite brands and some outfits you like. You are then assigned a personal stylist (shout out to my stylist Sophie Gaten) who reviews the preferences and emails you a list of suggested items. Thread currently has eight stylists working in house for its 250,000 active users, with one stylist in particular having 45,000 clients. If this seems like an untenable workload that is where the technology comes in. Founder and CEO Kieran O'Neill told Techworld: \"It's a combination of the stylist and the algorithm.\" Once the stylist has sent over the first set of recommendations the Thread algorithm starts to work, learning which items you like and dismiss before sending out weekly recommendations. This frees up stylist's time to concentrate on the initial taste profiles and the human actions of messaging, so you can even ask your stylist what she would recommend you wear to a wedding this summer. Thread is a free service which makes its money by working directly with big fashion brands, clustering orders at wholesale rates before selling and shipping items itself. Thread has raised more than PS7 million from seed and series A funding, with Balderton Capital the lead investor. Metail is a London-based startup founded by Cambridge graduate Tom Adeyoola. It is applying computer vision technology to various problems the fashion retail sector faces, from digitisation of garments and photography to the elusive virtual fitting room for ecommerce sites.  Its main consumer product is the MeModel, which is a virtual version of you built simply using measurements which can be dressed in garments from partner retailers. The startup wants to digitise the world's garments by using \"software to deform and warp garments based not just on how it changes shape but the underlying shape of the person under the garment,\" according to Adeyoola. Most recently Metail has announced its Composed Photography solution. This leverages its garment digitisation expertise to essentially deliver all the onsite model photography a retailer needs at far lower prices than existing outsourcing providers. Metail has raised nearly $20 million (PS16 million) to date from New World Private Equity and angel investors. It is currently planning a Series C round which will likely be led by strategic Asian investors. Wearable technology is still in it's infancy, and although smartwatches and fitness trackers are growing in popularity, they are still a way off in terms of aesthetics and subtlety. London-based startup Vinaya is a wearable technology company that recently launched its Altruis range (from PS220-275) of women's jewellery that connects with your devices to push custom notifications via subtle vibrations to a ring, necklace or bracelet. Vinaya has an ambitious design lab which is hoping to produce wearables that help re-balance our growing addiction to technology by adjusting to users moods and habits and dialling down notifications where appropriate. Founder Kate Unsworth told TechCrunch that the plan is to apply data-analysis to: \"Brain activity and psychology to try to understand how people are feeling -- and as a result of that the types of products that we can build to help them feel better.\" Eileen Burbidge of Passion Capital led on Vinaya's seed funding round of $3m (PS2.1m) in November 2015. Farfetch is a platform that brings together more than 300 high-end, independent fashion boutiques from across the world to a single shopping basket. Meaning you can shop for niche pieces from Italian boutiques from your trendy flat in Shoreditch. The only unicorn on this list (valued at more than $1 billion), Farfetch completed a huge funding round in March 2015, raising more than $194m (PS137m) from investors that includes fashion publishing giant Conde Nast International. Even e-commerce giant ASOS never reached a $1b valuation pre-IPO. Have you ever wanted to ask someone on the tube where they got their shoes from? No, just us then? Regardless, if you see an item you want to own but don't want to ask the person, simply snap a sneaky picture on your smartphone and use Snap Fashion to identify similar items from hundreds of UK retailers. You can then make the purchase through Snap Fashion, either in your browser or using the mobile app. Snap Fashion founder Jenny Griffiths received an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list last year before she even turned 30. Griffiths has already won the Decoded Fashion startup pitch, and first place at Cisco's BIG awards in 2012. Snap Fashion has raised an undisclosed amount during seed and series A funding rounds from investors Venrex Investment Management and Time Inc, respectively. Pocket High Street was born to support the little guy, the small retailers that struggle to compete with big e-commerce sites. The idea was to provide a quality online platform for shoppers to discover small retailers. The London-based startup provides an open platform which connects to major inventory systems, so that small shops can reach a larger audience and offer a click and collect delivery option. Pocket High Street has raised an undisclosed amount during a seed funding round so far. A fashion startup that is truly embracing cutting edge technology is Holition, which looks to help brands and retailers embrace 3D technology and augmented reality. Their latest product is where it gets really interesting though. Face allows cosmetics brands to show how their products look on shoppers without applying any product. Using 3D technology a smartphone or tablet can act as a virtual mirror. The possibilities for this sort of technology in the fashion and retail spaces are pretty intriguing. Holition already boasts Louis Vuitton, Tag Heuer, Lacoste and even fellow startup Lyst as clients. As shoppers continue to flock online, fashion brands are looking for ways to confront the problem of virtual fittings. Fits.me is basically a virtual reality changing room. It works by building a 3D model of shoppers so that they can try clothes on virtually. Fits.me claims to be able to model to a level of accuracy that accounts for clothes \"measurements, design intentions, grading rules and stretch factors\". This also opens up opportunities for retailers to send recommendations not just dependant on taste but also fit. Fits.me has raised PS9.2m in funding so far and was acquired by Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten in July, but will continue to operate out of London. Their services are currently only available on a bespoke basis. Shirt-makers TM Lewin, Hawes & Curtis and Thomas Pink are amongst the first clients of Fits.me. ",

    "title": "From card counting to clothing: How UK startup Metail is using computer vision to change the retail industry",
    "content": "As an economics student at Cambridge University Tom Adeyoola knew as much about card counting at the Blackjack table as he did about garment supply chains. In short: nothing. However, over the past eight years Adeyoola has gone from building online blackjack games to 3D modelling clothes and consumers. The connective tissue is computer vision technology - where computers can learn to recognise objects in digital images. Speaking from their London office in a redeveloped Victorian wool warehouse in Whitechapel, Tom Adeyoola, founder of the startup Metail, and his CTO Jim Downing explained how the business developed its underlying computer vision technology and how they plan to commercialise it in 2017.  In 2007 Adeyoola was sitting in his hotel room in Macau trying to solve a work problem: how to take advantage of looser rules around online gambling thanks to the Gambling Act of 2005 and create a live blackjack game for his employer Inspired Gaming Group. He wanted to create a game \"where you could have players or machines playing against a live table\", he said, \"and the way to solve that was by looking up and using cameras to recognise cards being dealt live in the casino\". The next step took a leap of faith. Adeyoola Googled 'leading expert in computer vision' and found Professor Roberto Cipolla at Jesus College, Cambridge. \"So I cold called him from my hotel room in Hong Kong. I asked him how easy it would be to create this system from scratch and he said 'no problem, come to my lab'.\" Cipolla introduced Adeyoola to one of his ex-PhD students: Duncan Robertson, whom he commissioned to build a proof of concept for this gaming system. The experience proved to the young entrepreneur that he was able to take a concept through to completion, and he started to set his sights on his own project. After months of soul searching he settled on online clothes shopping, an experience he calls \"emotionally draining\". He asked himself: \"Could I do that through creating a 3D virtual you?\" and saw a range of external signals that the timing was right: the growth of online retailers like ASOS, broadband penetration, the growing maturity of computer vision and cloud services. \"I felt that people had failed to solve the hard problems,\" he told Techworld. \"People tended to stick to the data side. So tell us loads of data about yourself and we will match you to clothes, and that was very onerous on the consumer. I didn't feel that was a way to get mass adoption. It needed to be easy.\"  Adeyoola says most of the retailers he spoke to had been burned in the past trying to find a workable solution, and had set their sights lower, opting to just take on size advice rather than providing a 3D visual of the consumer. \"For me it felt like you needed the visual to get a sense of getting something back from the user for asking them for the information,\" he said. So the Metail team worked away at its core MeModel consumer application, looking for ways to improve the accuracy of visuals in order to drive adoption rates. The startup went from asking consumers to arduously submit photos of themselves to simply working from measurements. \"We established that by using height, weight and bra size, and then adding in hips and waist, you can get the accuracy level we were getting from a photo and deliver a visualisation in under ten seconds, which is key.\"  Metail will be bringing photos back though to allow users to increase the accuracy of their model. \"Now people are moving to mobile we have gone mobile first and we will start to allow users to do more to increase the accuracy of their model.\" The CTO Jim Downing has also been working on deep learning algorithms to apply to user submitted photos. He explained: \"Where we used to fall down was users submitting Facebook pictures as it was all they had. So with deep learning we could make it more robust to those inputs. It will be able to work out what the pose was and which bits of the body it is seeing.\" Next Adeyoola turned his attention to digitising clothing items, and found the main stumbling block was cost. \"No one had been able to digitise clothing for cheaper than $300-400 per garment, so it was absurdly expensive.\" Adeyoola wanted to get that figure down to $3 per garment, and he turned to Duncan Robertson again to solve it \"because I felt the technology direction I needed to go in was computer vision\". The eventual solution was to simplify the process by digitising garments in 2.5 dimensions instead of 3D. Adeyoola explained: \"So starting with a sample we digitise against ground truth, which is a mannequin, and then based on the standard elements of how the garment changes into different sizes we use software to deform and warp that garment based not just on how it changes shape but the underlying shape of the person under the garment.\" So now Metail had to ensure that both the underlying MeModel and the overlying garment interacted correctly, and at speeds that wouldn't put users off. Before cloud providers like AWS allowed startups to specify the number of graphics processing units (GPUs) they wanted to use a company like Metail had to do everything on its own servers. \"So we had to build our own virtualised server farm of Mac minis, which was the best bang for your buck graphics processing unit on the market. Now you can specific GPUs in AWS and that has changed things a lot.\" And the cost? \"Now we are at $10 and have the R&D to get down to $3 and push those boundaries,\" Adeyoola said. \"Because we have gone out and made the process of digitising garments so cheap our big focus is digitising the world's garments. So we did 40,000 last year and want to do 100-200,000 this year.\" This approach led to a new revenue stream of its own. \"So this autumn we have a product called Composed Photography which is leveraging our digitisation expertise to deliver all of the onsite model garment photography a retailer needs at considerably less cost, increased flexibility and increase efficiency,\" Adeyoola said. Metail would essentially become the photography department for a retailer, using its warping software to reduce the amount of photos required to digitise a garment. \"So we needed to be able to do the photography in a way that we supply some sort of rig to go into their supply chain,\" he explained. \"So it could be operated where the garments are, because the samples are gold dust and that is where you need to do the photography.\"  Downing added that the breakthrough came when they realised \"that we didn't need a person behind the camera with a standard set of settings. The idea that by using computer vision you could still get good results was controversial at the time.\" The focus was on making it easy and simple enough to be operated by low cost labour. So for a one dollar labour cost per garment all of those images are sent to the cloud and processed by Metail. This allows retailers to shoot a model once and the collection on a mannequin and the software layers all of the items onto the model. Cutting recurring photography drastically and doing a lot of work in software potentially allows retailers to cut spending on models and focus on hiring superstar brand ambassador they only have to shoot once. So instead of having a stable of ten models, a brand could hire one Cara Delevingne. This also gives the startup a platform for selling in its value added services into retail customers, like the MeModel from which is takes a revenue share on all sold items. Eventually Adeyoola wants Metail to \"be wherever anyone is having a conversation about fashion\". What he means is, by digitising the world's garments a user could be reading Vogue magazine, scan the dress and see it on the MeModel, share it on Facebook and buy it on Amazon, all from their phone. Then there is the growing data side of the business. By having detailed data on what does and doesn't fit, and where users are abandoning items on their MeModel the startup's data could potentially enrich retailer's recommendation engines, or automate returns information to improve size recommendations on the back end. \"As we see garments as we shoot we can use deep learning and computer vision to apply attributes to those garments.\" So take a brand new jacket and Metail could use the metadata to liken it to an older item and pair it with similar recommended outfits as it did before. This is particularly powerful when you pair it with data around a user's body shape.  Adeyoola has high hopes for Metail in 2017, pushing towards greater commercialisation, especially in a UK market which has been tougher to break than Asia. He says that, regardless of the growth potential of Asia, breaking into your home market is important, if not simply for morale, and that one of the leading UK retailers is starting a trial next month. Metail has raised nearly $20 million (PS16 million) to date from New World Private Equity and angel investors. It is currently planning a Series C round which will likely be led by strategic Asian investors. ",

    "title": "The future of banking security: take a glimpse at the BT Adastral research centre",
    "content": "The business of banks relies on keeping savings safe, but hackers are finding ever more sophisticated methods to access them. Swindlers stole PS755 million across payment cards, remote banking and cheques in 2015 according to Financial Fraud Action UK, an increase of 26 per cent compared to 2014. The declining cost of technology iss lowering the barriers to entry for budding fraudsters, while emerging technologies give them new methods of theft. However the banking sector is developing solutions to match them. BT showed Techworld some future security solutions at its Adastral Park research centre in Suffolk. Cryptographic protection for real-time banking transactions today relies on mathematical equations that are normally sufficient for our computation powers. Contemporary encryption keys are often changed intermittently, as constant changes can be a major inconvenience for everyone involved. \"That's fine the way it is\", says BT lead consultant Ian Monteath, \"because these keys would take the age of the universe to crack.\" The rise of quantum computing introduces a disturbing threat to the way things are. Its vast computing power means encryption could be broken in a relatively short amount of time. Help is at hand for the security teams of the future. Quantum key distribution developed by BT and Toshiba can mitigate the threat by exploiting the laws of physics to make data encryption almost unbreakable. Encrypted data is transferred through the quantum key distribution system (left) and monitored by the eavesdropping device Encoded information is fired down optical fibre in single photons of light at a rate of up ten gigabits per second. Keys can be checked every millisecond if required, so a quantum computer has to crack potentially trillions of keys in order to access a meaningful volume of data. An eavesdropping device monitors any evidence of interruption creeping into the transmission on a tapping meter, which is reflected in the time of its arrival.   The laws of quantum physics dictate that you could change anything in the quantum world just by observing it. \"That's what makes this look like an ideal way of transferring keys,\" says Monteath. \"Anybody that tries to break and have a look at the data, they essentially start to corrupt the data.\" Any breach is identified immediately and the transaction aborted to avoid disaster. Because it can exchange data at such a high rate, an uncompromised key can still be used from the catalogue that's been stockpiled, and a new key can be sent automatically with no noticeable disruption. On the counter of the BT's model high street bank branch stands a Fujitsu biometric palm reader that can verify the identity of customer with a touch of the hand. Monteath places his palm above the device and it scans the veins underneath the surface of his skin by emitting an infrared beam sensitive to light reflected off haemoglobin in his blood. The pattern is recorded by the sensor and compared to his record on a database before access is granted. \"There's another technology which uses fingers, which are much more prone to constriction in the cold conditions,\" says Monteath. \"The reason they went for the palm in this instance was the depth of the veins within the palm are sufficient, and they don't tend to constrict as much as the ones on your fingers.\" A further form of biometrics is also on display. The facial biometric recognition tool known developed by a startup called Iproov can authenticate identity through a smartphone camera.  Monteath positions within a circle on the smartphone screen before a sequence of colours flash light across on the details of his face. Most similar devices only analyse an image, but this one goes a step further by streaming a video to the servers. Using a photo wouldn't work as it wouldn't reflect the light off his features in the same three dimensional way. It may be possibility to deceive by making a first-rate bust, but only if it's of a quality that few are capable of creating. \"It has to be Hollywood-grade prosthetics,\" says Monteath. \"It has to be that good before you've even got a change of it working.\" ",

    "title": "Meet the brothers behind RentProfile, the UK's first online landlord checking service",
    "content": "Like many victims, David Munday was a university student when it happened. He was looking for a place to rent, and found one on Gumtree. After viewing the property, David decided to move in, and transferred money for the deposit and first month's rent to the landlord. On the day he was due to move in, the landlord was nowhere to be found. He had fled the property, taking David's money with him. Effectively homeless, David had to move in with his elder brother Paul in London, and commute back to his university for the remainder of his studies. It's a sad story but one that's all too common. David, now 25, was one of eight students at the university conned by the same scam, at a loss of more than PS20,000 between them. Action Fraud received 3,193 reports of rental fraud in 2015, a figure the Local Government Association suggests represents just five percent of victims as embarrassment prevents most from reporting the crime. It estimates that PS63 million is lost to such cons every year. The two brothers from Oxford hatched a plan to prevent others suffering from the same scam. Paul, 35, was then head of account products at Betfair, looking after areas such as login and registration. \"When you join a site like that, there are actually quite a lot of checks that go on in the background,\" he says. \"I think most people have been through a tenant check, and we felt why isn't there a landlord check?\" In October 2016, Paul and David launched RentProfile, the UK's first online landlord checking service. The platform hosts a database of verified landlords whose credentials can be checked by potential tenants. If the landlord isn't listed, they can be sent an invitation to join, or a fee of PS9 can be paid to RentProfile to conduct the checks and compile a report.  \"No one's ever done a landlord check like this before,\" says Paul, 35. \"There are things like registers of landlords, but the problem with these is normally you put in a name or an address, but you don't know if who you're dealing with is that person.\" Their checks combine public domain records and other datasets to determine whether a landlord is legitimate or not. Land Registry records are used to verify the ownership of the property. The datasets offered there are either free, available for a fee or accessible only after further due diligence is conducted. Property ownership records can be forged, so RentProfile conduct further checks for safety. They include records of identity, landlord licensing and prosecutions and additional reports from other renters. The verification procedure is automated through an algorithm they designed, but they also conduct additional manual verification.  Paul manages the business side of RentProfile, while David handles technical development. He studied sport management at university, but decided against pursuing it professionally. His career took a new turn when Paul introduced him to Codeacademy, an interactive platform offering free coding classes. \"A lot of it was just learning through doing things and making mistakes. You know, breaking it, fixing it,\" he says. \"If you look around, it's quite surprising how many things you can get for free or low cost online from top universities.\" The self-taught developer now boasts qualifications on his CV from illustrious academic institutions such as Harvard and Stanford. He applied his new skills to design RentProfile using the Ruby on Rails framework. \"Originally after all this happened, David didn't know how to code,\" says Paul. \"I was looking for a cofounder for some time, somebody who could code it up and had considered outsourcing. In the end David was just very natural when it comes to this sort of work and development.\" In their research for the project, the brothers spoke to a few hundred renters and landlords and the RLA (Residential Landlords Association). They also commissioned an independent survey that showed there was a market for their idea and enthusiasm from both sides. Of the roughly 500 renters they surveyed, five percent had been victims of rental fraud. They've attracted around PS200,000 of investment so far, half of which has come from a government grant from Innovate UK. The brothers hope to expand their business to flagging illegal sublets with listings sites and local authorities. RentProfile shares its APIs so others can replicate the functionality, including embedding its website profiles in sites such as Gumtree. Getting local authorities and housing associations on board hasn't always been easy, but they've been supported by British trade association techUK and the housing sector innovation agency HACT.  Another idea they're working on is offering background checks on tenants, who can then share the results with landlords. The system would give renters an advantage in a competitive property market, and provide landlords with reassurances that their clients aren't rogue tenants. \"We sit in the middle,\" says Paul. \"There's good and bad on both sides, renters and landlords, and what we're trying to do is identify where that line is, and I think building up who people are and their history is our plan to do that.\" David never did find the landlord who ran away with his money, but he hopes the launch of RentProfile will prevent others falling victim to the same fate that he did.

    "title": "Access to tech talent crucial to Brexit negotiations, says Facebook EMEA VP Nicolas Mendelsohn CBA",
    "content": "Britain's impending exit from the European Union has led to fears over the future success of Britain's tech industry, but Facebook's EMEA VP Nicolas Mendelsohn believes there could be benefits if the country plays its cards right. Mendelsohn was speaking at a Culture, Media and Sport Committee hearing in the House of Commons on Tuesday discussing the impact of Brexit on the creative industries, tourism and the digital single market. \"It's both a threat and an opportunity,\" she said. \"The opportunity perhaps could be around what we do in our own country to skill up.\" Facebook chose London as the location for its first overseas office in 2007, and will open a new headquarters in the capital this year where it will add another 500 employees to its current UK headcount of 1,000 staff members. \"The future pipeline is perhaps the most important thing of all,\" said Mendelsohn. \"We came here from a tech company perspective because London is an incredible place for the tech industry and it's an incredible place to find great, highly skilled talent.\"  Key to that investment and London's status as a tech powerhouse is the continued channel of international talent into the city, and Mendelsohn wants this at the centre of Brexit negotiations. \"We would seek reassurances both for the people that are already here but also for the people who we might want to here in future, that they can come here and so can their wives and families, so that would probably be the main area that would be of importance,\" she said. Gaming and visual effects companies, many of which are very small, have especially urgent needs for talented professionals. \"You might make a game that can go all round the world, that's enjoyed by millions of people [and] it might literally be seven or eight people working out of Dundee being able to collaborate with the skill sets they need around the world,\" said Mendehlson. Bureaucracy is a barrier to collaboration, and difficulties accessing visas could prevent business progression. The negotiations also represent a chance to make it easier to access talent, by making British systems more responsive to industry needs. Tech talent is predominantly young, mobile and highly skilled, but wages and employment periods can vary immensely. The current tier two VISA has a qualifying salary of PS30,000, but this figure can increase when demand is high. Creative Industries Federation chief executive John Kampfner called for a system that looks beyond earnings, which is not always an accurate assessment of a worker's value. \"I would recommend some sort of caveat determining value that doesn't only use earning potential as the criteria,\" he said. Future requirements for overseas talent would need to cover long-term appointments, medium-term collaborations, and emergency visas to quickly bring in talent when required.  The recent rhetoric of Theresa May was reassuring, Kampfner added, but it needed to be reflected in official policy. \"This is a real opportunity for central government, in conjunction with local authorities, to really take advantage of that,\" he said. Mendelsohn was particularly concerned with the protection of Intellectual Property and the ability of the industry to sell content territorially. \"[IP] for all of us and the entire industry is absolutely crucial, because so much of our industry is built on having that and protecting the IP,\" she said. \"I think maintaining the core strength of the current regime is absolutely crucial going forward but also making sure we proactively negotiate and make sure we retain proposals going forward as well. This really is a red line for us.\" Key to her concerns was access to the Digital Single Market, an EU initiative established to cultivate the continent's digital economy and support access to online products and services. Its protection of the free flow of data across the continent is crucial to the future of small British businesses. \"Currently today there are 300 million people on Facebook that are connected to a small business in the UK,\" said Mendelsohn. \"That freedom of movement between the data is incredibly important in order that those businesses can trade freely, and it hasn't been an issue to date and hopefully it won't be going forward either.\" Discussions on the Digital Single Market are ongoing, but Britain's future role looks likely to be diminished. \"There is quite a lot of evidence that the UK has stepped back from the negotiations and that on a number of fronts is problematic,\" said Kampfner. There are already examples of UK institutions being forced reduce their role in EU collaborations. The Guardian reported in July that some British academics have been asked to leave projects funded by the EU as they are now considered a financial liability. But not all the opportunities offered through EU membership must end when Britain leaves the union. In addition to skills, the EU offers funding, regulatory framework and trade and investment opportunities that benefit the tech sector. The UK could still benefit from some of these after Brexit. \"We voted to leave the EU,\" said Arts Council England chair Sir Peter Bazalgette. \"We didn't vote to leave the Council of Europe and we didn't vote to leave creative Europe [or the single market]. We can continue with some of these things and they are very important.\"  Research and development receives 18.3 percent of the UK's funding from the EU, according to a House of Lords committee. It's possible to remain engaged with some EU funding bodies. Switzerland, for example, retains access to the Horizon 2020 pot by continuing to contribute to the EU budget. The growing resistance to immigration and multiculturalism could produce a less welcoming culture that would make the country a less attractive destination, as the reaction to the policies of President Trump has demonstrated. \"There is also the question of the atmosphere,\" said Kampfner. \"Where do you want to be? Whatever visa regime we introduce, Britain has a very sort of warm, open, inviting, meritocratic message to send.\" ",

    "title": "US biometrics startup Humanyze is bringing its employee tracking badges to the UK",
    "content": "MIT spinout startup Humanyze supplies biometric badges and accompanying software to companies wanting to track their staff. The five-year-old company is starting to make inroads into the UK market. Techworld spoke to the CEO Ben Waber about what organisations can learn about their staff using biometric tracking, and how to deal with the privacy concerns raised. Humanyze badges look like a normal employee ID badge but are equipped with radio-frequency identification (RFID) and near field communication (NFC) sensors, bluetooth for proximity sensing, infrared to detect face to face interaction, an accelerometer and two microphones.  The badges 'talk' to beacons set up around the office to detect proximity. The microphones, which seem inescapably creepy, \"don't record what you say but [the microphones perform] voice processing,\" Waber explained. \"So how much you talk, do you dominate conversations? Tone, volume, speed.\" Waber says all the data is processed in real time and nothing is recorded. It is processed in the cloud and distributed to the relevant employee and managers get an aggregated, anonymised view of their teams. The company combines this physical world data with data from work systems (primarily Microsoft) to pull calendar and email usage data (not content, it says). By combining digital communications data with data from the physical world managers can use Humanyze dashboards to get a \"holistic view of what goes on in the company\", Waber says. Managers can start to see how they spread their time between people, how different teams talk to one another, if meetings are inclusive enough and how cohesive groups are. Waber says that managers can use this aggregated data to see \"what top performers do that others don't? You can test how you manage the business, A/B test different [office] layouts before implementing them.\" Waber says the overall aim is \"quantifying the value of employees having coffee together in the age of of working from home.\" Employees can also access their own personal dashboards to see \"what you do, how you compare to the team average. If you want a different role you can look at what they do. You can start to see how you compare, so benchmarking within your company,\" he said. Concerns over workplace monitoring and biometrics came to a head last year when Daily Telegraph journalists objected to their desk time being monitored. The main issue here was around consent. According to Buzzfeed the staff were not asked for consent to be monitored at their desk and only discovered what the devices were after \"googling the brand name and discovered they were wireless motion detectors produced by a company called OccupEye that monitor whether individuals are using their desks\". In the UK, Citizens Advice states: \"Your employer can legally monitor your use of the phone, internet, email or fax in the workplace if: the monitoring relates to the business; the equipment being monitored is provided partly or wholly for work; and your employer has made all reasonable efforts to inform you that your communications will be monitored.\" However, \"some employers monitor their workers without informing them that this is happening, for example, by use of hidden cameras or audio devices. This is very rarely legal.\" Waber says that he thinks these sorts of laws and regulations are out of step with this next phase of physical, biometric tracking in the workplace though. \"You need government regulation on this to ensure that people opt in for this stuff,\" he said. Waber is naturally keen to avoid this kind of reaction to his technology. So, when an organisation contracts Humanyze they will come into the office to brief staff on how the system works and what is, and isn't, recorded. Everyone signs a disclaimer and there is no obligation to take part. When asked if not taking part could be damaging from a career perspective, in other words, that by even asking employees to take part you are applying implicit pressure, Waber didn't miss a beat: \"If you tried to force people you would have a negative impact on the workforce that counteracts any positive effect the tech has,\" he said. Furthermore, employees that don't want to participate can wear a \"fake\" badge, however he says that generally Humanyze gets 90 percent participation, \"so we are generally quite good at communicating the value of this and make sure we do it the right way,\" he said. Transparency will be key to adoption of this sort of technology. Waber is unhappy with the tabloid (and broadsheet) press coverage Humanyze has been getting in the UK so far, where they tend to exaggerate the privacy concerns. For example, a piece by The Mirror about the company leads with the entirely misleading headline: \"Your boss could track you day AND night using new smart technology.\" Waber laughed off the headlines, saying that being able to track employees day and night would not only be wrong on a moral level -- \"from a privacy perspective it is the wrong thing to do,\" he said -- but on a business level too. As he said, trust is vital to Humanyze when it comes to attracting new customers. \"Any potential value of that information would be dwarfed by the legitimate negative reaction that people would have,\" he explained. In terms of the UK market Waber admits that uptake has been slower than in the US and Japan but he is \"seeing uptake in healthcare and financial services\". However he wouldn't be pushed on which companies are using its services. ",

    "title": "TickX revisited: A year in the life of gig, theatre and festival ticket comparison site TickX",
    "content": "Dubbed the 'Uber of events', TickX pulls over 70,000 events from over 30 ticket sellers. The app compares gig, theatre, sports, club night, comedy and festival ticket prices on one site and smartphone app. \"If someone's thinking of a ticket seller we want them to think TickX. We want to be the one-stop shop for event goers,\" TickX cofounder Steve Pearce tells Techworld. In the last 12 months operations have gone from strength to strength for founders Sam Coley and Steve Pearce, with TickX.co.uk reaching 100,000 monthly active users and its revenues growing 40 percent month on month. Not to mention appearing on BBC's Dragon's Den. After interviewing cofounder Steve Pearce this time last year, Techworld caught up with Pearce again to discuss what's happened over the last 12 months. See also: Meet TickX: the ticket comparison startup using Skyscanner's winning formula. \"We've worked hard and have grown the team. We've brought Tim Chambers, one of the world's most connected guys in terms of ticketing on to our board as a non-executive director,\" explains Pearce. \"Then we just focused on really growing the traffic to our website, going from zero to 100,000 monthly active users. It was this growth and our progress to date that enabled us to attract a much larger PS750,000 investment,\" adds Pearce.  Both Coley and Pearce appeared on Dragon's Den at the start of 2017, when TickX was hailed \"the Uber of events\" by multi-millionaire Peter Jones. The startup received three offers of investment: a joint offer of PS75,000 from Peter Jones and Nick Jenkins for 20 percent equity, and one from Touker Suleyman for 15 percent equity. But to the surprise of the Dragons, the pair rejected all offers. \"We actually filmed Dragon's Den in May [2016] and when we said no to the Dragons we were looking for investment that that point. And then we managed to finalise that round of investment in November [2016],\" says Pearce. \"We were pleased with the results. It was just a huge stamp of validation that they were interested in TickX. We just felt that the offers undervalued the business, where we are up to and our progress to date. So we thought we'd roll the dice,\" says Pearce. \"We are confident we have made the right decision\", he adds. Since its filming, TickX has secured PS750,000 in funding from investment firm 24Haymarket, former Chairman of BskyB Nick Ferguson and Stan Boland and other top-level investors, adding to its PS175,000 backing from music giants Ministry of Sound secured last year. This funding adds up to 10 times more than the PS75,000 offered by the Dragons. \"Upon closing that round we are now a team of seven and we will be going to 12 in the next three to four months,\" says Pearce. \"We are in a period of rapid growth now which is nice to have because when we first finalised the round we were just dipping our feet in the water and getting used to growing the users and getting used to the tech. But now we're seeing rapid growth every month,\" he adds.  For any startup in any sector, the first couple of years are definitely the hardest. Getting to grips with aspects of business law, staffing issues and technical matters are among the top issues startups will face in the early stages. \"One of the challenges we've faced is the shortage of developers in the UK and finding talent, particularly on the tech side,\" explains Pearce. \"Another challenge is that we are working round the clock, you never stop thinking about it. So finding some sort of work-life balance is important. There really isn't any separation which is both a positive and a negative. \"Finally raising capital is very tough. We've brought some incredible investors onboard but it's not been a smooth journey. My advice for anyone that's trying to raise funding is to try and get the growth there first and try and get excitement to the platform to get a lot of people interested in what you're doing because people like backing companies that other people want to back,\" says Pearce. Last year seemed to be the year of the chatbot, or at least the year companies started making chatbots part of their business strategy. And TickX is no different. \"We're going to be launching a ticketing bot. You'll be able to send a message to Facebook Messenger and it will show you all the events around you,\" says Pearce. \"It's the new hot topic. You can get from A to B a lot quicker. And we want to have it so you can say, 'find me four of the cheapest upper circle tickets to see the Lion King' and it can say 'how about these?' and send you the correct ones. \"I think it's going to be the first of its kind globally really as we've got his special source of inventory that no one else has so it should be quite an exciting project,\" highlighted Pearce.

    "title": "The Museum of Failed Innovation: Celebrating the disasters that drive success",
    "content": "Rarely does a successful entrepreneur triumph with their first idea, as the setbacks endured by such tech luminaries as Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs prove. Events such as FailCon are helping to destigmatise disaster and embrace mistakes as an inevitable risk on the road to innovation.Creative researcher Dr Samuel West is taking the celebration of failure a step further. The CEO and cofounder of Superlab will open the Museum of Failed Innovation in his native Sweden in June 2017. He offered a pop-up preview of the permanent exhibition at the Mirum Opus Demystifying Innovation conference on Tuesday.West developed the idea while studying a PhD in Organisational Psychology at Lund University.\"My research focused on how a playful work environment promotes creativity and part of playfulness - an important part - is experimentation and being allowed to fail,\" he explains, as trains rumble above the Victorian railway arches at the Behind the Bike Shed venue in Old Street, London.\"There are so many examples of failure everywhere but they're always swept under the carpet. And there's so much to learn, it's fascinating.\"Within the walls of a temporary white igloo sit a curated collection of creative blunders. They include a handheld Apple computer, a Kodak camera, a Betamax recorder and a forgotten flavour of Coca-Cola. Each item is ranked in four separate categories: innovation, design, implementation and disruption.The exhibition itself was inspired by a Croatian homage to the physical memories of lost love, the Museum of Broken Relationships in Zagreb.\"I love that museum and thought I could do something [similar],\" says West. \"An abstract concept in concrete form.\"Inspirational quotes stamped across placard stands beside the detritus of abandoned ideas. West is particularly partial to one reminiscent phrase: \"All successful innovations are alike,\" it reads. \"Each failure fails in its own way.\"\"I love the Tolstoy quote,\" says West. \"He says: 'Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.' I love it! I stole it!\"He draws a direct correlation between embracing failure and driving innovation, and wants more companies to follow the approach of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.\"They're two sides of the same coin. You can't have innovation and those positive barometers without having the negative, which is spending money on products that nobody buys or that fail.\"[Bezos] says 'Amazon is the best place in the world to fail'. So in every letter to the shareholders he always emphasises how important failure is, and he's one of the few CEOs that actually says the word failure. Everybody else uses different language to sugarcoat it.\"Everybody knows you need to fail to innovate. It's not a secret. That's why I admire Amazon, for being so candid about it.\"The daredevil approach of American companies isn't always welcome in other cultures. The reserved British character, for example, is traditionally more renowned for caution.\"Where there's more hierarchy, sometimes there's more risk in failure,\" says West. \"So if you fail, you're going to take more consequences. In Asian cultures where hierarchy and saving face is more important, you're not as honest about your failures.\"In one of the analyses of Nokia's failure, a general explanation of why they failed was that the management system was based on reporting good news.\"If you weren't positive and didn't gave good things to say you didn't say them, so the higher level management had no idea how f*cked up everything was because they only got the positive rosy reports.\"There's a reason why the companies you see that are extremely successful are American, because they have so many experiments going at the same time that something is going to pop up that works.\"There are lighter subplots in some tales of decline, such as the infamous collapse of the Betamax video format.The pornography industry has a long history of innovation, and some suggest that it played a decisive role in the downfall of Betamax. While VHS producer JVC welcomed the backing of pornographic distributors, Sony maintained a policy against such material.\"We didn't write it because it wasn't appropriate, but they didn't license their technology like VHS did,\" says West.\"Sony wanted to sort of maintain control, so JVC f*cked them over by licensing it to everybody and anybody. And then to the porn industry, they're like no, we want to keep it clean. JVC is like: Here you go!\"A couple of years later, who's the biggest one? JVC. Some people say that porn had a bigger role than the serious analysts would like to say.\"Sony may have lost this video tape format war, but wouldn't repeat the mistake when launching its latest innovation in video in 2006.\"Someone came in before saying that with the Blu-Ray versus the [HD DVD], a similar thing happened, except that Sony had learned their lesson: Hey porn!\"Apple boasts a proud history of innovation, but not every idea that originated in the company enjoyed the success of today's ubiquitous devices. After Steve Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985, his old adversary John Sculley hatched a plan to develop the world's first personal digital assistant (PDA). The handheld computer could have heralded a tech revolution when the Newton was launched in 1993. The pocket-sized device could take notes and send faxes and came equipped with a stylus and 2MB of expandable memory. But the handwriting feature that was central to the concept proved disastrous, drawing widespread mockery that spread as far as The Simpsons. The Newton rates highly for innovation and design, but the implementation was poorly planned. It did, however, provide a foundation for some of Apple's most defining creations, as the man who scrapped it would later acknowledge. Jobs returned to the company in 1997, and promptly cancelled the platform. \"By shutting it down, I freed up some good engineers who could work on new mobile devices,\" he told his biographer Walter Issacson. \"And eventually we got it right when we moved on to iPhones and iPad.\" The Betamax video cassette recorder was the first commercially-successful device that let viewers tape TV shows. The concept proved so troubling to the entertainment industry that Universal City Studios pursued a copyright infringement case against the Sony Corporation all the way to the Supreme Court in 1984. Sony won the case, but it was losing the videotape format war. A year after the Betamax hit stores in 1975, its Japanese rival JVC released a compelling competitor. Its VHS was viewed as technically inferior, but the tapes lasted 60 minutes longer than the Betamax's initial hour limit. The longer runtime meant that VHS could record an entire film. The device was also cheaper, and while Sony was reluctant to share its technology, JVC licensed it to any manufacturer that wanted it. Before long, even Sony was selling VHS. Kodak was a pioneer in digital photography. In 1975, electrical engineer Steven Sasson invented the first digital camera. The 0.01 megapixels device took 50 milliseconds to capture a black-and-white image, but 23 seconds to record it onto a cassette tape. His bosses at Kodak were unimpressed.  Sasson suspected that the long-term potential was a distant dream for the ageing executives, but they did allow him to continue his research. In 1978, Sasson's prototype was patented, and in 1989 he co-created the first modern DSLR camera with his colleague Robert Hills. His superiors remained unmoved, fearful that the design would eat into the profits of their established print business model. Kodak's spectacular failure to capitalise on his inventions triggered a 15-year decline that would eventually prove terminal. In 2012, the company went bankrupt. It survives as a cautionary tale to the innovation-resistant. The noughties boom in premium coffee beverages convinced Coca-Cola executives that their expertise in caffeine had been underused. A more sophisticated coffee-flavoured drink targeting an older, \"savvy, sophisticated achiever\" called Coca-Cola Bl?K was launched to fill its gap in the market in 2008. Word of mouth is rarely a success when no one can pronounce the name of the product, so providing a pronunciation guide on the label proved an unhelpful promotional tool. The short-lived beverage with the divisive flavour was discontinued in 2008 after less than two years on the market. It wasn't the Coca-Cola's first failed reinvention. In 1985, the company's flagship soft drink was losing ground to its sweeter Pepsi nemesis. A new formula was concocted, and the product was relaunched as \"New Coke\". The strategy proved disastrous, and almost proved a decisive defeat in the Cola Wars, proving innovations to a winning brand aren't always a risk worth taking. ",

    "title": "Here's why we are likely to see more tech IPOs in 2017",
    "content": "Disclaimer: my prediction of IPOs is about 50/50 in general so, whatever you choose to take from this piece, please do not run out and start placing bets based on my opinion. This time last year, I expected the end of 2016 to be very different to how it actually was. I have seen a few trends in the tech space that I saw a few times when the bubble was building but have also got it very wrong on a couple of points, timing-wise at least. I did however make a few view points on the IPO market which were spot on. 2016 was a quiet year and I am guessing this is largely down to the changes the US is going through.  For quite some time I have been following a few of the tech champions out there who, shall we say, get a little more press than maybe the others. But I have been keeping an eye on those who don't always hit the headlines. One company I did take a look at last year was HotelTonight. I came across this company when arranging a trip to New York. I am the first to admit that the amazing Airbnb has made me never use a hotel again but I also have fond memories of getting great deals on hotels back in 2004/2005 with platforms such as laterooms.com. HotelTonight had a bit of a challenge last year after a quite extraordinary burn rate which resulted in cutting costs. Most CEOs don't realise they need to adjust things until it's too late, so well done that CEO. Anyway, I hear on the grapevine that there is pressure for the company to IPO at the later stages of 2017. Good IPO or bad IPO? On a similar note, I love Airbnb and if I was a hotel group, I would be seriously thinking this is my typewriter or Nokia moment. Airbnb has had some serious investment and you get the feeling the company has done some good housekeeping and is in a good position for an IPO in the multiple billions. I would put cash in them as a pretty safe long term bet. On a different topic, how did we operate development teams before Slack came along? I am going to go out on a limb that Slack will file for IPO in 2017. CEO Stewart Butterfield came out end of last year saying that he didn't feel Slack was ready for IPO until he had the internals of the business in a situation ready for a public offering, which is fantastic to hear when you compare that to the view people took back in the dotcom boom. However, I get the feeling from other information they will look to IPO and to be honest, looking at it objectively, I cannot blame them. My other \"go out on a limb\" company to IPO is Okta which, in terms of use as a product, I welcomed having seen Active Directory just about everywhere I looked in cloud services. The company has raised over $200 million to date and has an impressive list of investors that most companies could only dream of getting on board. The key though is that its competition in the space has been selling and I just get the feeling this company is ripe for an M&A deal. Now the big question is do we start having an IPO market with super crazy valuations and a lack of actual revenue to really match them? With that, a number of founders getting out while it's good plus VCs and investors getting greedy and the hype machine making everyone believe their own BS? This remains to be seen and my only piece of advice would be that if the machine really starts again, then get out on the start of the way up, as it could be 1999 all over again. ",

    "title": "Parkopedia: The London startup betting big on machine learning and autonomous parking technology",
    "content": "Parkopedia started out a decade ago with the aim of mapping the complex parking landscape in major cities, giving users of a single view of all the nearby car parking options. CEO Eugene Tsyrklevich explained to Techworld how far the business has come over the past few years in terms of data science and why it is betting big on helping car manufacturers with the challenge of autonomous parking.  \"When the company started big data didn't exist, the iPhone had just launched, deep learning as a term didn't exist, so we couldn't have predicted any of this stuff. What we did know was parking was and still is a problem. \"Fundamentally we still allow people to find and pay for parking around the globe, but how we do it and go about that is changing and continues to change.\" You may have already used Parkopedia without realising. It provides parking information onboard newer vehicles from the likes of Volvo and Volkswagen (VW), as well as within Apple's own iOS maps app. The startup has amassed a trove of parking data since being established in 2007, from fairly static data on various car parks (address, capacity, height restrictions, opening hours, price, etc.) to an increasingly dynamic data set provided via APIs from partners, which includes availability at any car park that has sensors fitted to its barriers, plus GPS and traffic flow information from the car manufacturers themselves. Parkopedia started out with people on the ground surveying and taking pictures of car parks and storing the data on racks of on-premise servers. Now it has been shifted to Amazon Web Services. It now holds petabytes of parking information in the cloud, including millions of images, alongside the dynamic data feeds from its partners. Here the startup can leverage some of the elastic compute power available through AWS to do more advanced processing of this data, increasing the reliability of the service for users. This is where the data science comes in. The Parkopedia team of four PhDs has developed predictive algorithms to give drivers an indication of availability at a car park ahead of arrival. Tsyrklevich says that at a car park with sensors installed, and which is feeding this data to the Parkopedia app, is able to predict availability to 95 percent accuracy.  However, Tsyrklevich notes \"the parking industry is not a very sophisticated industry\" and most of the time this sort of technological infrastructure isn't in place. He explained: \"The reality though is that most car parks don't have that because it is expensive. Particularly for street [parking] there isn't a huge appetite from local authorities for this, so we have to fall back on other data sources.\" As part of partnership arrangements with car manufacturers Parkopedia receives information from connected navigation systems. \"That data is already used to create traffic maps. We are using the same data from the same systems but instead of working out how quickly they are moving we work out how they are moving, so are they circling an area to find a space? We use that to figure out if there is a space available or not,\" he said. \"That is just one example of how we leverage machine learning in a relatively dumb domain of parking.\" Tsyrklevich's focus now is on autonomous parking. \"While everyone is concentrating on the exciting and hard part of navigating a motorway or a city, very few companies today are talking about what happens when a vehicle gets to the destination and what happens then,\" he said. \"That for me is where we step in and grab this last mile, or 500 metres, of routing after you are dropped off.\" In short, Tsyrklevich wants Parkopedia to be the data source autonomous vehicles use to understand where to park when there is no GPS coverage - such as in an underground or multi-storey car park - and then to help it navigate to the space. This is what the company proved with Volkswagen and presented at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this month. Commenting on the project, Parkopedia's COO Dr. Hans Puvogel said: \"The self-parking car of the future will need excellent data to find the right parking spot, transaction capabilities to book and/or pay for it and indoor navigation capabilities.\"  Using a 3D laser scanner Parkopedia creates a 3D map of inside a parking garage to the centimetre, including every wall, ramp and pillar. The car then uses its own sensors to navigate the space, as it would with GPS coverage, to navigate to, and eventually into, the parking space. If a car park has sensors over every space this could then be used to indicate which spaces are free for an autonomous vehicle. Parkopedia is still a small company though, and Tsyrklevich realises that this sort of project has its risks. He believes that autonomous driving - and parking - is a question of when not if, but \"there is such a thing as being too early\". \"At this point we need to answer a few questions, some are technical regarding if it's possible for a vehicle to navigate fully autonomously without GPS coverage, and we have proven that out with VW. \"The next question is when will the vehicle of the future actually require this? As you can imagine, going out and laser scanning car parks is not a cheap endeavour so it is expensive and time consuming and while we have people on the ground globally, we would rather not do work at that scale and expense unnecessarily.\"  This means that although this is a big project for Tsyrklevich he is proceeding with caution: \"We are continuing to work on the autonomous valet parking but we need to work out when the car industry is ready.\" \"That is a huge project, we have proven some of the concept but it is a massive area trying to figure out how to do this better and at scale, not just at one car park but across 75 countries.\" ",

    "title": "How the UK government supports technology startups | How to get government backing for your startup",
    "content": "Last week at the consumer electronics show (CES) in Las Vegas the event's organiser said the UK government's lack of support for startups was a \"source of embarrassment\". Gary Shapiro's comments were no doubt self-serving - he was criticising the government specifically for not supporting startups to attend CES - but did he have a point? UK minister for sport, media and culture Matt Hancock responded to the criticism, telling the BBC: \"He's wrong on that because the British presence here is significant. This is one of many different shows around the world where we have a British presence. In a sense what it shows is there is a constant battle to stay ahead.\" So what does the UK government do to support technology startups? Here are the main resources available to founders, from hard funding to soft advice. There are many ways to fund a startup. You can bootstrap the business yourself or through friends and family, go to the bank or gain entry to an incubator or accelerator. In terms of government support though there are several funding routes that can be taken.  The government's Start Up loans scheme offers up to PS25,000 at a fixed interest rate of 6 percent per annum for new business ideas, as well as mentoring and support services. Theresa May pledged PS2 billion in government investment by 2020 for projects and businesses conducting research and development of cutting edge technology, with a specific focus on AI, robotics and biotechnology. Government body Innovate UK (formerly the Technology Strategy Board) holds funding competitions for businesses and research organisations. Funding of between PS250,000 and PS10 million is up for grabs from its 2016/17 budget of PS561 million for anyone working on emerging technologies; health and life sciences; infrastructure systems; and manufacturing and materials. For businesses setting up shop in the capital there is the London Co-Investment Fund, founded and managed by Funding London and Capital Enterprise and which includes PS25 million in funds from the Mayor of London's Growing Places fund. This money is earmarked for investment in seed rounds of between PS250,000 to PS1 million for successful applicants. In terms of soft support the Business is Great website is a solid resource for information on subjects as varied as how to protect your intellectual property to tax advice. Tech.london is also a resource for founders to find tips on setting up in the capital, from workspaces and events to mentorship programmes, job boards and funding tips. Tech London is a joint project between the Mayor of London, investor portal Gust and lead sponsor IBM. London & Partners also offers support and advice for scale-up companies looking to set up shop in the capital. Former Mayor of London Boris Johnson also set up the International Business Programme last year to help UK startups to set up and trade abroad.  The government is also keen to present the UK as a good place for startups to set up outside of their home market due to its corporation tax rates, access to talent, the ability to register a business within 48 hours and general government support and guidance. For example: it may have outgrown the startup moniker by now but Snapchat parent company Snap Inc recently decided to set up its international headquarters in the UK, regardless of the Brexit vote. The government relaxed rules on visas for up to 200 \"exceptional\" technology workers a year through the Tech Nation visa scheme in October 2015. However many in the sector warn that access to international talent is too restricted. Since the beginning of April 2016 the Home Office has issued just over half of the available visas, according to Tech City UK. However, it still takes on average 16 weeks to hire someone through the government's tier 2 visa for skilled workers with a job offer and around three weeks without that. The government also offers entrepreneur visas for founders with \"businesses which have high growth potential\" and has been funded by at least PS50,000 from an approved organisation. However, the future of these schemes, and of visas for tech talent wanting to live and work in the UK in general, is currently up in the air following the UK decision to leave the EU. Nine technology entrepreneurs and investors signed a letter detailing recommendations for the government post-Brexit at the end of 2016, with free movement of talent a top priority. The letter states: \"It is imperative that the government recognises the need to attract and retain the very best talent globally.\"  In terms of actual recommendations the letter states its support for a STEM passport policy. This would mean the automatic granting of a visa, or permanent residency, to foreign students who earn advanced STEM degrees like PhDs at a range of accredited UK universities, to ensure talented individuals don't leave simply because they don't get a job straight out of university. France has recently set up its own tech visa programme called the French Tech Ticket. The government's broadband connection voucher scheme provided more than 50,000 businesses with discounted broadband before being shut down at the end of 2015. The government does still run better broadband schemes for businesses in areas where their speeds are below 2MB per second. Chancellor Philip Hammond has pledged PS1 billion towards the rollout of superfast fibre optic broadband across the country in the Autumn Statement last year, however this is the latest in a long line of similar, unfulfilled, pledges by government. Tech City UK is a government-funded body which provides a range of support for technology companies. Its schemes include the Future Fifty, which gives select startups access to expertise within both the Government and across the private sector. Alumni include Just Eat, Shazam and Skyscanner. Tech City UK also runs the Digital Business Academy, a free online learning platform for budding tech entrepreneurs to learn key skills, with rewards including free and discounted work space and mentoring. The government also backed a mentoring portal, linking new businesses with relevant mentors, called mentorsme.co.uk back in 2011. ",

    "title": "RAVN: the artificial intelligence startup helping to automate legal work",
    "content": "Automation has been a major theme within the technology sector in recent months, as attention turns to how it will affect white-collar professionals such as lawyers. However, some are already way ahead of the curve. One such company is RAVN, a startup based in London that works primarily with the legal sector and corporate lawyers. Clients include Berwin Leighton Paisner, Sky and Bloomberg. \"The legwork of the legal industry is reading documents,\" cofounder Jan Van Hoecke tells Techworld. \"This is about automating the reading process.\" Its AI software reads, interprets and extracts information from documents, converting unstructured data into structured output more quickly and accurately than any human, the company claims. RAVN's four founders (Van Hoecke, Peter Wallqvist, Sjoerd Smeets and Simon Pecovnik) met while working for another UK tech firm, Autonomy. \"The company doesn't bear a very great name anymore because of it appearing in the press in quite a bad way,\" Van Hoecke admits, referring to HP's botched PS7 billion acquisition of Autonomy in 2011. \"It was quite innovative when it launched, its first few years and its products - the initial vision was really good,\" Van Hoecke says, although by the end \"it was not innovating, and we figured we could do it better ourselves.\" For the first year and a half the founders were based out of Peter and Simon's flat. \"I was still the earliest one in the office even though they just had to crawl out of bed,\" laughs Van Hoecke. RAVN has always been entirely self-funded, and managed to secure success by picking up some impressive initial clients like Bloomberg. \"People always say if you keep control, you will never regret it,\" Van Hoecke says. \"But you might regret taking investors on board. It's tempting because you know with money you can do a lot of things. But if so many people say this, there might be some truth to it, right?\"  Originally the founders sold consultancy services, but they soon shifted to selling products. RAVN now employs 46 people at its London HQ, plus one office in Amsterdam and another in New York. The main focus was on developing new products for processing unstructured data, which make up the vast majority of most organisations' data. RAVN worked to improve the ability of software to analyse documents with its product RAVN ACE (Applied Cognitive Engine). The company provides a 'Knowledge Graph', which links together information within organisations: by document, team, project and so on. \"We trademarked it and Google has in the meantime breached our trademark, so we should probably sue them - but on the other hand that's probably not going to happen,\" Van Hoecke laughs. RAVN also offers enterprise search products, which help to make it easier for people to find specific information within their company. \"Documents are not the final entity of information,\" he explains. \"If you are looking for something - say how to switch on the screensaver of your Mac - you don't want to go through a 20 page manual. You want to get an answer.\" \"We have a lot of competitors on the search market, but market is fragmented,\" he adds. \"Search engine companies stagnated, they were bought off by organisations like IBM and Microsoft and there was very little innovation. There still is, we're not challenged very often.\" The fact RAVN has become a company that focuses on 'AI for lawyers' was not a deliberate choice, according to Van Hoecke. \"We just got into it quite early, and we got quite good at it,\" he says. \"We got a good reputation as well.\" The reason RAVN has been so successful within the legal sector is not so much down to the type of documents involved, but the fact that the people reading them are expensive, and there is a big pressure on lawyers to become cheaper. \"They have one of the most old-fashioned ways of working in terms of the automating of their processes,\" Van Hoecke says. Another factor is the exponential growth of documents within legal firms. \"There are more contracts, they are becoming larger, so that means your legal costs will go up exponentially, which is obviously not feasible,\" he adds. Van Hoecke says he does not believe that RAVN's technology is replacing jobs. \"It's not replacing lawyers, it's enhancing them,\" he says. \"I don't pitch this as an AI lawyer doing things on their own. It's more a calculator. If you do those computations manually that takes so much time. Likewise you don't want to read 1,000 contracts. You want to get facts out of it and make your analysis - that's what you are good at, that's where your know-how comes in.\" Looking ahead to the rest of 2017, RAVN hopes to embed its reputation as an AI company and broaden its reach beyond legal into sectors like telecoms, finance and insurance. However, like many tech firms, the founders have Brexit-related fears regarding immigration. \"I think we employ 16 nationalities. That's not by design. It's by circumstance. We have Scandinavian clients, French and Spanish and for that we need native speakers in those languages. I don't know if we have to worry about our staff leaving. I hope not,\" Van Hoecke says. However, he remains upbeat about London's prospects as a tech hub. \"People sometimes ask me 'why did you start it in London?' But I think the question should be turned around,\" he says. \"It's because of London that we started. It still is one of the best places in Europe to start a tech company and didn't have that overhyped cycle that the Valley has, or the extremely high wages the Valley has. There is a lot of talent and there are a lot of clients. The only negative part is that office space is quite expensive.\" ",

    "title": "Best platforms for web hosting for startups and small businesses | What's the best web hosting service? | Best shared web hosting services",
    "content": "Whether you run an established small business or are just starting out, web hosting services will be needed at some stage, unless you plan on hosting your website on a (large and expensive) server yourself.Web hosting platforms will normally offer a few different packages including shared hosting and dedicated servers. For startups and small businesses, shared hosting is the most fitting option as cost remains low with decent reliability and customer service.Shared hosting means you will share a server with a variety of sites and while some argue that this can slow down site speed, for small businesses with relatively simple and clean websites, this shouldn't be a major concern.Dedicated hosting refers to renting your own physical server and should really be reserved for larger enterprises with high traffic levels. So while this will be suitable for your business one day (all being well) there really is no need to opt for an expensive dedicated server until you're ready.We take a look at some of the best shared web hosting services out there for startups, entrepreneurs and small businesses.For around PS5 a month, GoDaddy can transfer whole existing websites to a hosting platform and offer 1-click app installation if you want your site to be linked to apps such as WordPress. For the same price GoDaddy will provide one website with 100GB storage, and for a little extra, users can upgrade to the Deluxe plan which offers the same services for unlimited websites and unlimited storage. What's more, it provides an easy to use CMS which aims to ease page uploads, and enables users to regularly access their content. GoDaddy also offers free backup, restore, and also provides an uptime guarantee of 99.9 percent (according to their website anyway). Like GoDaddy, German company 1&1 is a web hosting giant offering both Linux and Windows packages starting from PS2.99 per month (excluding VAT). 1&1 offers a variety of services including free web design software, phone and email support, a graphics archive and a pretty impressive 300Gbps network connectivity. What's more, 1&1 provided a hybrid platform, this means that your web server and webspace are on the same platform, a good choice for those wanting an inclusive and stable package. Sadly, 1&1 does not offer website domains and offers a fraction of the online storage that rivals GoDaddy provides, coming in at 10GB rather than GoDaddy's 100GB. Based in the UK, Easyspace offers (unsurprisingly) a number of UK-based data centres and both online and telephone support. So for only PS2 per month, Easyspace will provide 50GB of storage, a free domain name, 20 databases and 200 mailboxes. Although, for PS10 per month you can have unlimited, well, everything. Easyspace goes all in on the extras and incentives. Easyspace requires no setup fee and offers yearly discounts of up to 35 percent off the cost if they buy hosting for multiple years. What's more, Easyspace offers PS50 Google AdWords vouchers, free email marketing credits, email filter trials, free images from Fotolia and Word Press hosting, which is a unique range of extras.  SiteGround offers affordable web hosting plans, and from PS2.75 per month (excluding VAT), users can take advantage of reliable security, customer service, and an array of useful tutorials, making it ideal for first timers. SiteGround's shared web hosting lets users choose from their US, European and Asian-Pacific data centres. SiteGround offers both Linux and Windows hosting with a range of price plans available. Starting at PS2.75, its StartUp tier offers one website, 10GB of web storage and 10,000 monthly visits, while its GrowBig service provides multiple websites, 20GB of web storage and 25,000 monthly visits. For larger companies SiteGround offers GoGeek with provides multiple websites, 30GB of web storage and 100,000 monthly visits. Shoreditch-based UK2 provides affordable web hosting with its business package offering unlimited emails and bandwidth, free SSL certificate, a free domain and an IP address. UK2 also sells an 'essentials' package providing users with 10 websites and one free domain name but users will miss out on an IP and a SSL certificate, but for startups or micro businesses this really won't be an issue and might be the best choice financially.  Users can always upgrade to the business package when their business is big enough. Supporting both Linux and Windows, Fasthosts offers unlimited bandwidth across all its packages, 100MB mailboxes, one free domain for a year and unlimited FTP accounts.  If opting for its middle tier package, users will receive three websites, 20GB SSD space, CMS, along with all the other standard features, for PS7 per month.  What's more, Fasthosts offers UK data centres and free 24/7 phone support. And incentive-wise, Fasthosts provides PS130 of ad vouchers for all users. The majority of people might look at One as a website builder, but it actually offers a solid web hosting platform too. All One users will receive a WordPress support, unlimited email accounts, unlimited transfer and a domain. Interestingly, One offers one year free on basic packages including 15GB of storage, 512MB RAM, single database, single domain and SSL. After the year is up, it's PS1.38 per month, although you'll have to pay PS10.80 for the initial setup. ",

    "title": "Meet Essensys, the UK startup looking to help coworking spaces beat WeWork at its own game",
    "content": "London startup Essensys builds software which helps shared office landlords automate their IT and manage all their tenants in one place. The platform looks to take the IT department out of modern offices by allowing employees to self-serve things like desk booking, meeting rooms and lockers. Founder and CEO Mark Furness is an outlier when it comes to the London startup scene. The outspoken Liverpudlian doesn't fit the typical tech CEO template but if he has to fall on either the business or the technical side he is definitely more salesman than engineer.  Furness admitted to the BBC earlier this year that he knows \"not one jot\" about how to write a software programme. He made his entry into the IT industry in the early 2000s. What he saw was a problem to be solved: \"I used to look at everything to do with technology within the enterprise and it was really complicated.\" \"You'd ring up the IT team and say the time was wrong on your phone and you would get a big intake of breath and told to put a ticket in. So there had to be a better way.\"  Essensys now essentially handles the IT for 6,000 businesses in the UK, and 250 in the US, where it has been operating out of New York for almost six months. Its annual turnover is more than PS12 million and it employs more than 90 people. The startup fell into its target market of coworking spaces, as Furness explains: \"The first pitch I did was to a brand new shared workspace company who said these are my challenges, namely: responding to clients requirements when managing fifty companies with different IT needs, efficiently and cost effectively.  \"They lined up with what we were doing and we didn't look back, that first customer meant that we would become the IT provider to that flexible workspace industry. That immediately became the play for us.\" The Essenys platform started out as a way for businesses to automate their IT but has evolved to become a de-facto customer relationship management (CRM) tool for shared workspace landlords following the acquisition of UK startup and workspace management specialists Hubcreate.  The platform that came out of the acquisition is called Occupie \"which is a single platform for the industry to manage all kinds of workspace. The whole customer journey,\" Furness says. The four parts are prospect (which is essentially a CRM tool for landlords to manage tenant acquisition), operate (enterprise resource planning), connect (flexible IT infrastructure like wifi, network and phone line provisioning) and community (a self-serve platform for tenants to book meeting rooms, reserve desks and ancillary services like postage). Landlords can manage their tenants in one place, from customer acquisition to automated billing, and employees can work in an environment where their technology needs are met and resources like desk and meeting rooms can be booked straight from their phone, without an IT ticket in sight. Occupie is run in the cloud, in a private instance across four data centres, two in the UK and two in the United States. It is priced on a typical software-as-a-service (SaaS) model of pay what you use. The shared workspace market is booming, with flexible working on the rise and tech companies looking to embrace the WeWork model of design and technology led work space to attract young talent. The US company WeWork, which rents and subleases office space with a specific look and feel, has ridden this wave all the way to a $16 billion valuation and 500,000 members.  Essensys targets smaller players trying to emulate WeWork's model. Furness said: \"Regis and WeWork are 17 percent of the global market opportunity. My job is to empower that 83 percent to beat them at their own game.\" What this means is it's now better placed than any software company to benefit from the boom in coworking space, working with smaller tech incubators like Level 39 in Canary Wharf and The Dock in Wapping. Property agents and brokers, science parks and serviced offices make up the rest of the Essensys customer base. Furness sees his advantage over the big players as a case of focus. \"I've got 70 product people and I think WeWork's developer team is 20 people. It's really difficult for a WeWork to keep up with someone like us that only thinks about this singular focus.\" Although Furness would never use the Silicon Valley term, he certainly sees Essensys as well placed to hit unicorn status. \"I have no doubts, this is a billion dollar company and I hope I am here when it is and I want to do it based on real metrics like revenue and earnings,\" he said.  Furness also refused to rule out the possibility of taking its first round of venture capital or even going public. \"If you asked me a few years ago I would say I am the last person to take my company public,\" he said. \"Now I think that is a definite option. I think we are the right size and the growth curve is right, the tech is proprietary so we have the IP. We have all the attributes for growth capital or a listing.\" Furness clearly feels that he has put the company in a position to succeed, saying his job now is to \"set the tempo of the business and make sure we don't fuck it up\".
