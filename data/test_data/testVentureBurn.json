The competition saw 50 applicants from over 18 countries competing for the top positions and cash prizes. The Amman competition follows the first Fincluders challenge held in Berlin last year. The top position of the Fincluders challenge and a cash prize of $20,000 went to AgroCenta, a startup which provides an online trading hub for farmers and their customers using real-time payments leveraged by mobile-money technologies. In addition to the trading hub, the startup also provides an on-demand logistics service. \"The Fincluders Startup Challenge has been an eye opener for us, helping startups accelerate by giving them the opportunity to network and meet potential investors and partners,\" said Francis Obirikorang, co-founder and CEO of AgroCenta in a press release to Ventureburn. Second place with a cash prize of $10,000 went to Liwwa, a marketplace lender to SMEs in Jordan. Democrance, a Jordan-based micro-insurance provider for those living in low-income populations, took third place, with a cash prize of $5,000. BenBen, a startup providing access to blockchain \"land transactions\", while not making it into the top three, received an honourable mention at Fincluders. \"We are both elated and humbled by the interest in the Fincluders Startup Challenge here in Amman. The finalists proved their skills and determination during the pitching round of the competition, and we are confident these fledgeling businesses can contribute to spreading access to finance in the region, which is also the main goal of our fund,\" said Sanad board chair Daniela Beckmann. Finalists were provided with flights and accommodation for the duration of the competition. The first day featured mentoring sessions conducted by range of industry experts, while the second day required finalists to present their products and services to a jury of industry experts. ",

Seedstars World will hold events in Johannesburg on 26 May and in Cape Town on 8 June, with the top applicants to be invited to the finale hosted at the Standard Bank Auditorium in Johannesburg on 29 June. The SA leg of Seedstars World is being held in partnership with Standard Bank and other local partners such as Enel, Microsoft4Afrika, Orange, Merck, TRECC and Deloitte. Other local partners include Entrepreneur Traction, PayU, Seedspace, Simodisa and Startup Grind. To be eligible to apply for the competition startups need to be less than two years old, have raised under $500,000 in funding and have built a minimum viable product. Additionally, eligible startups would need to have existing traction and some regional and global scalability. \"Standard Bank is proud to be the country sponsor of Seedstars South Africa for the third year,\" said Jayshree Naidoo, head of the Standard Bank incubator in a press release to Ventureburn. \"These partnerships allow us to help change the narrative of the potential that exists on the continent and helps us recognise and create access to market opportunities for those businesses that make it to the regional finals and the finals,\" said Naidoo. In addition to the SA leg, the global competition will travel to 80 countries in search of their best startups to pitch for their chance at winning $500,000 in investments. Previous Seedstars World participants have raised over $61-million collectively, providing employment to more than 800 employees worldwide. \"South Africa does indeed have world class entrepreneurial talent. Our priority for 2017 is to cast the net event wider and give the opportunity to the whole country to participate and become part of a global journey,\" said regional manager for Africa at Seedstars World Claudia Makadristo. South Africa has been represented before at previous Seedstars World finals. Giraffe won the global prize in 2015 and in 2016 IDWork was the competition's wildcard winner. \"The entire Seedstars world experience has been absolutely amazing -- from the regional summit in Rwanda to the global summit in Switzerland.

    "content": "Nigeria must overcome its infrastructure challenges and shortage of skills if it is to help the country's nascent tech scene to grow, say analysts and entrepreneurs. The country boasts such successful tech companies such as fintech company Interswitch, edtech firm Andela and e-commerce site Jumia, which last year raised $326-million in funding. In addition, investments from overseas programmes such as Y Combinator, Village Capital and 500 Startups continue afoot, despite the country having slipped into a recession last year. Nigeria's burgeoning startup scene and its large market and entrepreneurial population with over 180 million people is what lured Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to Lagos's Yaba startup district in September last year. Generation Enterprise managing director Bunmi Otegbade, who helped get 30 entrepreneurs to pitch to Zuckerberg and President Muhammadu Buhari, believes the government's lack of support for the sector is not the problem. For Otegbade it's rather the country's poor infrastructure and shortage of good talent -- better software engineers and technical workers -- that is holding back the tech sector. \"The people in the tech system is the first problem. If we can improve them we can then work towards improving policies,\" he reckons. \"If there are investors in Nigeria who asked what needs to be done to find better deals, they would say you just need to work on improving the team behind the entrepreneur,\" he adds. Harsh business climate While the country is ranked by the World Bank at 169 on ease of doing business, Bunmi believes Nigerians have become used to operating in a harsh business environment, with few incentives for startups. For instance, businesses must start paying taxes from day one. Electricity is rarely stable. \"Most tech companies need to spend 40% (of revenue) on power revenue, compared to six percent in other countries,\" he says. But adds Otegbade: \"We have become so used to them (the problems) that we don't see them anymore\". 'Better government policies' However, Collins Onuegbu, from the Lagos Angels Network and executive vice chair of Signal Alliance, disagrees. He says better government policies can play a catalysing role in the initial surge of startups in Nigeria. \"Nigeria is currently trying to diversify its economy from oil. Tech is one of the areas of that diversification so we are hopeful that government involvement will allow the sector to keep its current trajectory and become a bigger contributor to the rebound of the Nigerian economy.\" He believes the worst of the recession that started last year is over and that foreign investment will start flowing back into the country soon. Investor confidence needed For Polish entrepreneur Marek Zmyslowski, who has been living in Lagos for over four years, there are no shortcuts -- Nigeria needs more educated customers and better competition. \"You don't just need more government support, you need investor confidence.\" For Zmyslowski, who runs software service for hotels called HotelOga, the state of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Nigeria is comparable to what it was in Poland 30 years ago. He says many Nigerian startups make the mistake of believing that they will acquire customers quickly online. However he says because not enough customers are online this is often not the case. For instance half his startup's marketing budget has gone on radio adverts or paying for sales agents at bus stations and airports. \"Many times we find it's the first purchase anyone has made online,\" he says. With the cost of internet so-called \"zombie phones\" are common -- where users turn off their data access to prevent apps from automatically updating and using up their expensive data. 'Fallen behind' But Nigeria wasn't always like this, argues Nigerian tech expert Emeka Okoye of Cymantics. Last month he said in an interview with Nigerian tech site Techpoint.ng that while Nigeria once sold software systems to US banks, the country has fallen behind such that it has no tech ecosystem. He says more must be done by the government and other roleplayers to get Nigerians to produce technologies rather than consume imported goods But Onuegbu chimes in that the press in Nigeria assume wrongly that tech entrepreneurship there is only a recent phenomenon. \"Over 20 years ago, a class of startups did exactly what Emeka described from a part of Lagos called Surulere. For some reason, most of these companies failed to scale and grow their businesses beyond their initial promise.\" Held back by state He says while Nigerians are an entrepreneurial people, the country has been held back by a government that focused on a one product, oil-based economy, adding that this has stifled creativity and entrepreneurship. \"The current struggles the economy is going through should be an opportunity to reset the country and its economy and build a future based on entrepreneurship and creative business development. \"I believe that this should not only benefit tech but every other sector that a country of 180 million people needs to help citizens enjoy better livelihood and  professional fulfilment.\" For entrepreneur Dayo Elegbe, who runs Lagos based mobile marketing startup Sponge, Nigeria is on the cusp of something big, He returned to Lagos after living and working for 20 years in the UK, because he says the opportunity was too great to forego. \"One of the reasons I came back is I'm an entrepreneur and I couldn't literally walk away from such a good opportunity. I came back to Nigeria and realised that this is going to be one of the biggest mobile markets in the world,\" says Elegbe. Ventureburn was unable to get in contact with anyone at the Nigerian Information Technology Development Agency. Last month Nigeria's Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Okechukwu Enelamah revealed that his ministry is working on plan for a digital economy which would create over three million jobs.

These are just some of the seven biotech and agricultural projects that will each receive seed funding of up to R500 000 from the Cape Craft and Design Institute (CCDI) in partnership with the Technology Innovation Agency's (TIA) seed fund and the Western Cape government's Department of Economic Development. CCDI executive director Erica Elk said at the announcement that an investment committee made up of experts from various sectors assessed the shortlisted applications in December and January. The seven projects were selected from 21 shortlisted candidates. A total of 57 applications were made when the application process opened in October last year. During the CCDI's first seed fund which ran from 2014 to last year, the non-profit worked with 12 firms, which generated R1.5-million in revenue over the period, created 18 jobs and leveraged an additional R10-million in funding. Elk said a key lesson from the organisation's first round was the need to work with individuals' sectors. The current round focuses on certain areas identified by both the national and provincial departments as growth sectors. These are: biotech, health, agro-processing and manufacturing. TIA acting seed fund head Vusi Skosana said the agency's seed fund is supporting 324 university projects with R142-million and 104 small business projects with R37-million. He added that the agency is looking to set up a rapid fund in which former seed fund participants will be able to get additional funding approved \"within 24 hours\" for development and projects costs. The seven projects to be supported are: The Optishunt -- A medical device to be developed by Daemon McClunan which uses a novel method to treat glaucoma.\nOranet -- An innovative method conceived by Woolf Katz to manufacture oak extract for use in the manufacture of wine and spirits.\nDNABurn -- A cellular molecular biology solution developed by Karim Dhanani of Signal Bioscience to help fight non-communicable diseases.\nFlyH2 -- A hydrogen-powered drone conceived by Mark van Wyk and Onno Huyser that releases lab-bred insects to wipe out pests.\nMicropatch -- A self-testing kit for HIV being put together by Incitech which was founded by Loretta Magagula, Dineo Lioma and two other alumni of the Allan Gray Orbis Foundation.\nSuction dissector -- A medical dissecting tool for soft tissue developed by Disa Vascular.\nSmartBlade -- An affordable video laryngoscope developed by Nick Levin and Caroline Corbett, which uses a smartphone.

Speaking in Cape Town, he said he and officials from the Western Cape government, including Finance MEC Ivan Meyer, were asked by the Reserve Bank to present to the bank on happenings in the Western Cape ecosystem and economy. The presentation took place last month and Winde said that it was the first time that his office has been asked to present to the Reserve Bank. \"And when they did their presentation, the presentation opened up with a discussion led by Silicon Cape and the kind of work that has been happening here by Webber Wenzel about how do we change IP and the rule around IP and the enabling environment so that our entrepreneurs can play a far more meaningful role.

This disruption, caused by many startups, could be leveraged by those same startups to scale. It's this mindset that the global cellular standards body, GSMA, has launched the Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund to help startups take advantage of the current disruption. \"Nevertheless, these mobile operators face a plethora of challenges. Sustainable competitive advantage in the telecommunications sector is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve. Likewise, while startups are vital forces in both the innovation ecosystem and the wider economy, the majority struggle to reach scale,\" the report stated. The fund will provide Asian and African startups with much-needed grant funding, technical assistance as well as the opportunity to partner with mobile operators within their markets. This assistance will help startups scale their products and services into sustainable businesses. The first round of the applications have already closed, however, the second round will open on 1 June 2017 with pitches due on 16 July 2017. \"We are extremely excited to start working with these innovative entrepreneurs, in particular, to help them explore synergies with mobile operators, and how to leverage mobile technology to its fullest to maximise socio-economic impact,\" said the head of the Ecosystem Accelerator Max Cuvellier in a press release. The first round winners of the Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund are: \"Today in emerging markets, more than anywhere else, there are opportunities for mobile operators and startups to collaborate,\" the report concluded.

Finfind CEO Darlene Menzies has been selected along with five other women by the World Economic Forum (WEF) as the continent's top female entrepreneurs. \"I think that we have a bit more of an advantage over men in this country in terms of starting a business from all the different accelerators and programmes,\" Menzies, whose web platform helps small businesses to source finance, told Ventureburn. Read more: Finfind initiative to link SA lenders with entrepreneurs seeking finance Menzies believes there are now more women in South Africa starting small businesses than there are women holding executive positions in the corporate world. \"I would encourage and challenge any women that the opportunities are awaiting them and that they should just get into them,\" she said. WEF searched for the top female entrepreneurs in tech to demonstrate and highlight the positive role they play in helping to drive growth, create employment as well as prepare their regions for more economic growth. During the search, hundreds of applications were sent in, during the search the top six emerged from all over Africa including SA, Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda. WEF set strict criteria for entrants. Eligible startups needed to be less than three-years old, show at least one year of revenue and have an innovative technology or business model operation. The selected entrepreneurs are: Commenting on how it felt to be one of the women recognised as the best in tech in Africa, Pandor said it was an honour to be listed. \"To be recognised on that level is a big honour, it's also a show of commitment from the WEF to want to understand and engage with businesses that apply their technology on the African continent.\" However, when it comes to equality in entrepreneurship, she feels that there's still a way to go. \"We're not there yet in terms of numbers and in terms of support that women get at the higher levels, so there is certainly a lot of work that needs to be done. \"But I feel very positive as a young female entrepreneur as to where my position will be in the next five to 10 years -- I feel like things will change in terms of numbers and percentages.\" Featured image: Jolanda Flaubacher via World Economic Forum Flickr (CC 2.0, resize) (Edited by Stephen Timm) ",

    "content": "A chance meeting with US listed company 2U's CEO Chip Paucek in October last year set Cape Town based SA edtech startup GetSmarter on the road to being acquired by the US firm in a $103-million deal signed on Monday evening. Sam Paddock (pictured on right), who is the company's CEO, said he and his co-founder and brother Rob weren't looking to be acquired. \"It became clear that joining forces would result in an organisation that could power the world's best digital education. This was too big an opportunity to pass on,\" he said. The deal, reported by Forbes magazine in an article yesterday includes an earn-out provision of as much as $20m in cash. Founded in 2008 by brothers Sam and Rob Paddock, GetSmarter delivers short-term online certification courses to distance-learning students in partnership with a number of top universities. Sam Paddock said while the deal was signed on Monday evening he expects it to close only on 3 July, adding that the entire executive team would remain with the company. When asked about how the deal was valued Paddock said this wasn't something he is able to disclose. He said GetSmarter has served over 57 000 students from 150 countries. \"We work on a revenue share model with our university partners,\" he added. \"There was a transaction (of $5m in venture-capital funding) with DiGame (and not Zouk as earlier reported by Forbes, he said) in 2016, but we didn't use it to fund our growth. We have bootstrapped the business entirely from founding. We have reinvested profits to fuel growth for many years.

    "content": "Nigerian startup PiggyBank.ng and Kenyan startup Olivine Technology have each scored $50,000 in funding from investment firm Village Capital, following the conclusion of FinTech Africa 2017, a three-month investment readiness programme. The programme was organised in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation and the DOEN Foundation with support from VC4A. The two companies were a part of a cohort of seven peer companies. PiggyBank.ng allows Nigerians to save small sums of money through an automatic savings process by working directly with financial institutions, while Olivine Technology has created ASiM, a mobile app that serves as a point-of-sale and stock management solution that connects multiple distribution sites seamlessly with their respective head offices. Participating entrepreneurs were involved in a peer-selected investment process which allowed them to evaluate one another across multiple investment readiness indicators, directing the investment award to the top two companies. Olivine Technology co-founder Joseph Karanja said the funding would be ploughed back into the business. He said the startup, launched in 2010 by Karanja, Mark Mwaura and Charles Muigai, has gained some traction with its smartphone app, and has picked up clients in the cosmetics, fuel lubricants, beverage and edible products sectors. Karanja said the product would help business managers to replace handwritten sales receipts from sales people and distributors, while assisting managers to view where sales are being made geographically. Village Capital CEO Ross Baird (pictured above) said in a press release that the company had seen growing financial access in Africa over the last several years, but that growing access did not necessarily translate to growing financial inclusion. \"There is a real lack of savings, credit, and investment solutions that work for women, youth, farmers, small businesses, and other underserved communities. \"After witnessing the progress of the FinTech Africa 2017 cohort companies over the past several months, we're even more excited about their potential to expand financial inclusion in the communities they serve,\" said Baird. The remainder of the cohort included: \"We have been proud to work with Village Capital to identify and support the next generation of FinTech entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa,\" said Youssouf Sy, associate programme manager for the Mastercard Foundation.

Since then the FSB has received a number of calls from interested parties who mistakenly believe the authority is about to release crowdfunding legislation. Read more: South Africa's FSB to rule on crowdfunding by June 30 In a Q&A with Ventureburn, FSB deputy executive officer for financial advisory & intermediary services Caroline da Silva explains what the deadline is all about and details the FSB's current approach to crowdfunding legislation. Ventureburn: What is the June 30 deadline set by the FSB all about?\nCaroline Da Silva: The 30th of June is a target date in terms our internal project plan. It is a deadline we have given to ourselves to address all the remaining issues on the project before communicating our position to the industry. The finalisation of this project is dependent on factors that are outside our control and may result in us meeting or not meeting our target date. VB: The FSB completed a report looking at equity crowdfunding regulation. When was it completed? What did the report broadly contain?\nCDS: The research we conducted was aimed at giving us insight on how crowdfunding is regulated in other jurisdictions and what legislation would govern crowdfunding activities in SA. VB: Is the FSB studying or planning to study equity crowdfunding regimes of any particular countries?\nCDS: We looked at crowdfunding activities in the Netherlands and other European countries, India, Kenya, New Zealand and the US. VB: What consultations has the FSB held so far and with which industry groups?\nCDS: We have engaged the Africa Crowdfunding Association. VB: Is the FSB allowing Wealth Migrate and ThundaFund to trial equity crowdfunding under a special dispensation?\nCDS: No, the FSB has not allowed anyone, platform or entity to trial equity crowdfunding. VB: What steps will be taken now by the FSB over the coming months to decide whether SA needs regulations on equity crowdfunding or not?\nCDS: The final phase of the project would include the following:\n(1) A demonstration of crowdfunding business models by members of the Africa Crowdfunding Association.\n(2) Consideration on whether we should test equity crowdfunding in a sandbox environment. The FSB anticipates that it would be in a position to communicate progress in this regard to the industry should there not be a need for more consultation with affected stakeholders.

    "content": "Accelerator programme Innotribe has chosen 10 startups for the third edition of the Startup Challenge Africa, for secure financial messaging provider Swift's African Regional Conference which takes place in Abidjan, in the Ivory Coast, later this month. The 10 were selected after 100 judges evaluated close to 100 applications. Applications came from a number of African countries with SA, Nigeria and Kenya filling up most of the positions. \"It is a pleasure for us to see the number of African startups applying to our programme growing year after year. Their calibre continues to impress, and there is no doubt they are going to play an important role in shaping the future of finance,\" said Fabian Vandenreydt, Innotribe's global head of securities markets and head of the Swift Institute, in a press release to Ventureburn. Participating startups are as follows: These startups will be pitching their new products on 17 May in front of hundreds of delegates from more than 40 countries, during Swift's African Regional Conference. This will also serve as a platform for the startups to network with potential investors, partners and customers. The selected startups will undergo coaching sessions in Abidjan with top entrepreneurs to prepare them for their pitching day. Once the selected startups have concluded with their pitches the audience will vote for who they thought were the top three startups. The top three will then go on to Sibos, Swift's global financial services conference which will take place from 16 to 19 October in Toronto, Canada. At Sibos, the winning startups will receive a $10 000 cash prize as well as share the stage with other FinTech experts to share their innovations and insights happening in Africa. \"The Startup Challenge is an enriching experience for all participating companies. They benefit from expert mentoring and get that much-needed exposure to financial institutions,\" said Vandenreydt. ",

    "content": "Silicon Valley based SA entrepreneur Vinny Lingham says he plans to open an office in Cape Town to hire developers for his new startup Civic, following reforms to South Africa's Intellectual Property (IP) control regulations. \"The Reserve Bank by listening to the community and making the changes (to the IP control rules) have opened it up to more foreign investments,\" Lingham said in a Skype call with Ventureburn from San Francisco on Friday last week. Lingham recently posted a link of Civic's Facebook account saying the startup is looking to hire in South Africa. It follows an announcement by then Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan in the Budget Speech in February that the IP exchange control would be relaxed. With the relaxation of exchange control, the SA Reserve Bank would allow certain authorised dealers to process cross-border IP transactions on its behalf. Read more: Startups take note: an update on IP control Lingham said previously it had been a complicated, \"messy\" and expensive process for any SA entrepreneur based overseas who wanted to set up an SA office for their company. \"The law prevented South Africans from investing back home,\" he added. \"Previously to set up an office in South Africa we had to have a separate company which is unaffiliated with the US company because I am a shareholder of the US company and I'm still a South African citizen.\" Lingham was not sure yet how many jobs Civic would add at the Cape Town office. \"We'll start up with a handful and we'll grow the office and as we expand into South Africa we will be able to invest locally there as well,\" he said. He said setting up an SA office was a good bet. \"There's great talent in South Africa and with the exchange rate as it is we don't see it coming back, so it's good value for money.\" He said he was in the process of applying for exchange control approval to set up the SA office. \"I've got some people on the ground who are doing it in Cape Town. They're working with the Reserve Bank and they'll be working with people there,\" he added. Lingham said he will launch his new startup Civic on 25 May at blockchain conference Consensus in New York. He said that a poll he ran on Twitter a few weeks ago saw 85% of respondents indicate that they wanted the product. He said the service would primarily be consumer driven, while some partner companies had already agreed to accept the service. The product will allow users to share information such as users' social security or identity number securely from any device with digital signatures that certify that the validity of the information hasn't been tampered with. Civic is working with a number of governments at present, although Lingham declined to say which governments these are. \"We give you a way to securely store that information on a device with cryptographic keys which guarantee that (the identity) is you, and so the person who is receiving the information can trust that it's you...\" \"We basically sign your information... and if it comes from your device it's you and when it comes from someone else it's not.\" Lingham says he and his team have been testing the product for 18 months now. \"We don't store data on our servers so there's no backdoor in... It's all on your device and it's all stored on your device using Apple's and Android's protocol.\" He says his product will decentralise the storage of data, such that one has to have physical possession of any device to appropriate the information. \"The thing is this -- if someone hacks a bank they can steal 20 million IDs. With us they can't because they don't hold it (the information). They can hack your device and get it, but they need to have physical access to it.\" Click here for the link to Civic job positions in South Africa.

    "content": "South African Peter Bauer, who just over 18 months ago listed his email management startup Mimecast on the Nasdaq, once turned down a R30 000 offer for his then business in the late 1990s, only to sell it a few months later for R20-million. Mimecast, which Bauer started in 2003 with fellow South African Neil Murray, listed on the Nasdaq in November 2015. The company's stock price has since doubled and trades at about $24 per share, bringing its total market cap to $1.2-billion. In the late 1990s, after selling his stake in a school stationery and goods supplier and after having travelled a bit and completed a Microsoft engineering course, Bauer started a tech business developing niche software and applications for corporates. \"We were running on scant liquidity again, and so were very tempted when less than a year into it, we were made an offer,\" he explains. It was from a larger IT company who wanted the business for R30 000. He and his two partners decided to hold out for R40 000. The would-be acquirer called their bluff, and headed back to Johannesburg with a closed chequebook. \"18 months later the dot-com ridiculousness was in full swing, and we sold for R20m,\" he added. But he explains that they only got to that point because the three were able to secure funding from friends and family. \"We each did what it took to bring R100 000 in. My dad had just retired as a teacher, and kindly gave me a meaningful portion of his retirement fund.\" In 2002 Bauer left for the UK with the proceeds from the R20m sale he made on his then tech business, intending to export South African tech services to a hard currency market, and profit take on the arbitrage. It never panned out, as he met Neil Murray, and within a year Mimecast was born to fill the gaps they saw in the state of email security and archiving offerings. His own capital had been dented by the failed software exporting venture, so the two never had buckets of money to start. \"The need for money shouldn't be at the expense of control, he believes. \"We ran very lean for years,\" he says. \"At Mimecast, we only got formal venture capital six years in. It came from Index Ventures, and it was very helpful, but we were able to negotiate it largely on our terms.\" In this and subsequent rounds, the two exchanged capital for reduced-voting stock. Bauer and Murray wanted to maintain control of their business, and they had a view on how it should grow, and at what pace. \"We could probably have sold Mimecast for $300m in 2013, and it would obviously have been the wrong route.\" Had the two not maintained control, the billion-dollar valuation that eventually came may well not have materialised. \"Things can get wrong-headed quickly, and it's important to stand firm and play the long game if that's what you've decided.\" He advises that founders understand the benefits of control, but not at the expense of growth. \"Retain control, structure properly, take on capital very carefully in order to grow.\" On the question of why he left South Africa, he says, \"It wasn't driven by the smallness of the South African market. But I had just come out of what was, for us, a huge exit, and I wanted to move into an environment where I would have to learn, stay sharp and start again.\" He says he fielded similar questions when he and Murray decided -- because of the bigger bang it would make -- to list on the Nasdaq and not in London where Mimecast was based. \"I always tell people Mimecast is a global company, with London roots, and a South African background. I think South Africa would benefit from more South African businesses thinking of themselves as global -- or potentially global -- from the outset.\" Bauer also recalls how he dropped out of a business and marketing course during his  first year to pursue a business supplying South African Model C schools stationery and other goods. His partner was older, wiser and had an MBA, and they bootstrapped the business out of a Cape Town garage. \"I learnt very quickly how to optimise limited capital,\" he recalls. \"Founding with a partner is better than going it alone, but I learnt some important lessons about what to look for and avoid in a co-founder. \"The business succeeded, but I never fully realised the difference between ownership and employment, so when my partner pressured me to sell my equity to him for a bigger share of the year's profits, I went for it. Once the realisation set in, and we fell out, I left.\" He says he was devastated at the time, \"but if it hadn't happened, I'd probably be the king of the Western Cape school supplies game now, so it was for the best\". This interview with Peter Bauer, alongside 28 others conducted with South African ecosystem players, form the foundation of a report called \"Unicorns, Gazelles and Rockstars\" by Levin, due out later this month.

    "content": "Mentors can prove invaluable to entrepreneurs looking to grow their business as they can impart important knowledge and act as an important guide in the lonely world of starting a business. So says Alexandra Fraser, director of Silicon Cape and a Barclay's Rise mentor -- one of a number of Barclay's Rise Techstars mentors who spoke to Ventureburn on the benefits of mentorship, following the announcement earlier this month of the accelerator's next cohort of startups. Read more: Barclays accelerator announces latest participants in African programme Fraser said networks and relationships, much like ones you make with mentors are important, particularly when you're an entrepreneur. \"Being an entrepreneur is a fairly lonely journey and it's a hard journey, it's not a walk in the park, so I think the other thing about mentorship is that it keeps morale high. \"It encourages you and allows you to build connections with people who've done it before and for them to know that even though it's not an easy journey it's a fulfilling journey and you've got a support structure.\" Venture partner at Quonna Capital Johan Bosini echoed this, pointing to the importance of surrounding oneself not just with those you just, but with people who are different to you, as diversity can give you a fresh perspective on things. \"Historically it's just been each to his own and there seems to be, through programmes like this, a more collaborative approach to 'if one succeeds we actually all succeed as a community' rather than individually trying to beat each other,\" said Bosini. He has some tough advice for many budding entrepreneurs. \"I've always said to a lot of people starting out that it's the worst idea you'll ever have starting a new business. But, if you're insistent on doing it I would say talk to everybody and anybody even your competitors because it gives you a perspective and context in terms of where you are and validation.\" Fraser stresses that the relationships one builds as a mentor with startups are important. \"From a mentor perspective, it allows you to learn about new businesses, it allows you to learn about a new innovation, it allows you to think about technologies and how they're being applied. There's always a learning opportunity from being a mentor.\" Fraser added that being a mentor also allows one to give back and to build a community, and is a way to \"hopefully give before you get\". Parcelninja co-founder Justin Drennan also shared some of his experiences mentoring the previous group of Techstars. \"Last year was quite interesting in that we had a lot of international people mingled with our SA startups, so it was quite a cosmopolitan bunch which I think led to a lot of cross-pollination of ideas between a lot of the businesses.\" He recalled how he was able to get some of the participants' businesses market-ready. \"We (the mentors) got to add to that process and I think that a lot of experiences that we've had from being in business for let's say 10 years; we were able to distill and assist these businesses in a way that was productive for them.\" Read more: Do you want to be a mentor? These 5 tips will help One of his methods to assist the entrepreneurs is to help them come to their answers on their own using examples of past experiences. \"We try to share a lot of experiences we have in business and see if they can sort of pick up on that and learn and I think if they have access to competent mentors that can sort of shortcut the learnings then for all of the 'school fees' we've paid they can sort of benefit from that.\" Drennan said being a mentor requires you to participate fully in a startup, but pointed out that if you're giving by nature then the experience is fulfilling. \"At the same time I think it's something that needs to be done, entrepreneurship is something that needs to be embraced and we need to help people out that are starting a business,\" he said. \"I think that's the future of our economy, these people that are starting up businesses and they need people, mentors and individuals to help them accelerate that (growth) process. You can't have nine out of 10 businesses failing.\"   ",

    "content": "\"It was crazy, getting accepted into an accelerator held by Google of all companies -- we didn't expect it,\" recalls Vibescout co-founder Jonathan Myburgh, on being accepted into the Google Launchpad Accelerator last month. Myburgh told Ventureburn how getting accepted into the programme proved a great \"morale\" boost for he and his team from the event and content aggregator startup. Vibescout was conceived by Jonathan's brother and co-founder of the company, Paul Myburgh, while on a trip to Vietnam in 2014. Jonathan recalls how at the time his brother had exhausted all the available tourist activities and wanted to do what the locals were doing. But he couldn't find any information on how the locals liked to spend their time. His only source of information at the time were hotel brochures and fliers. Paul then approached his brother with the idea of creating a possible solution to solve this problem. It was then in 2015 that Vibescout was born. Two years on Vibescout was accepted into Google's world-renowned accelerator. Read more: Google's Launchpad Start to empower African SMEs \"The Launchpad experience was amazing. They really went all out with how they arranged the event, they handled all admin related to travel for the startups completely, the programmes were well planned and the quality of the mentors they arranged to interact with us in one-on-one sessions was invaluable,\" he said. Jonathan said the accelerator provided him and his brother with much needed time away from the day-to-day routine of the business, allowing them to focus on the fundamentals for their startup. The biggest lesson they took away was how to run a design sprint and effectively get the best user feedback, he said. \"We also got to sit down with a Google expert and take a critical look at the back-end of our system. They helped us reduce our server costs with Google by 40%, as well as to improve the overall speed of the platform.\" Vibescout also had the opportunity to interact with mentors such as Chris Grant, a senior director at King; Angus Brown of eBucks as well as ProSiebenSat.1 Accelerator MD Jens Pippig. \"The input they were able to give on specific challenges based on their experience was priceless for us,\" said Jonathan. Read more: Q&A: Google's John Kimani on Launchpad Start Jonathan said he and his brother were able to some great conversations with other startups on the programme about things such as their tech and marketing strategies. His only criticism of the programme was that the organisers tried to cover too wide a variety of topics within the space of just a week. \"If the programme was less 'one-size-fits-all' and took a more personal or targeted approach to some of the startup's needs, it could have been a bit more effective,\" he said.

    "content": "South Africa has been in hot water politically and economically after the country's credit rating was downgraded to \"junk status\" earlier this month. Despite this the local currency has shown resilience and economists believe that policy changes should steer the country towards a recovery. According to its central bank governor, the country is still attracting capital flows which should be good news for South Africa's tech scene. Africa, as a continent, has a growing tech scene with 314 active tech hubs. South Africa leads the continent with 54, according to a recent graphic by GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator. But if there's a tech scene South Africa can learn from, it's Poland's. Poland has positioned itself as the major tech hub of central and eastern Europe (CEE). Its roster of companies with multi-million dollar valuations is growing. Here are six lessons South Africa can learn from Poland's tech scene: Poland produces top tech talent. Computing is part of the curricula at all levels. Programming website HackerRank puts Poland at third globally as the country with the best developers. This hasn't been gone unnoticed by other major startups. Lower labour costs and an English-speaking population has enabled Poland to become a major outsourcing destination for software development work for companies in the US and UK. Polish software companies have made software-as- a-service (SaaS) their niche. SaaS allows these tech companies to have worldwide presence without having to worry about cross-border distribution or putting physical presence abroad. There is a wide array of services catering to both B2B and B2C markets. Among some notable SaaS brands include social media monitoring service Brand24, social  listening tool SentiOne and development platform SaaS Manager. Polish entrepreneurs also insist on building sustainable businesses. While there are active venture capital funds and angel investors active in Poland's tech hubs, most entrepreneurs insist on funding themselves. This allows their businesses to be profitable from the start rather than worry about making an exit to make money. South Africa has yet to produce its own unicorn. Perhaps Poland's best known billion-dollar companies are game developer CD Projekt and ecommerce auction site Allegro. Nurturing a homegrown unicorn can open up more opportunities. It communicates that the country continues to be a viable place for business and it also create prospects for spin-offs. Email marketing platform GetResponse, which now has more than 250 000 active users including enterprises such as Avon, Hilton, and Citroen, has enjoyed positive business and eventually spun off new services such as ClickMeeting. Part of cultivating the scene is presenting it as a regional hub. This includes hosting global events that gathers industry and thought leaders in the region. Poland is host to two of the biggest tech events - Pipeline Summit and InfoShare. These events draw developers, entrepreneurs and investors together and playing host to such events position the country as the epicenter of tech activities. It is also important to be the gateway for a bigger market. Poland has been that for the CEE. There's a reason why Google elected to put up a campus in Warsaw - it's the search giant's foothold for the rest of CEE. Since the move, Google has unveiled programs to fuel tech development in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic through is Warsaw campus. South Africa already enjoys being the gateway for business in the region in general. Nairobi and Kenya are also making strides in their tech scenes so there are contenders to South Africa's position. It's time for South Africa to refocus that image for tech. Ultimately, the challenge lies in the tech startups themselves. With such a troubled economy, it is critical to consider sustainable growth rather than rely on venture capital and exits. By bootstrapping and focusing on innovation, there's always the chance for a big break for any of SA's startups.

    "content": "SA entrepreneur Stephen Larkin claims that investors could be in for \"free cash\" of US$20-billion if his exploration company, which uses a unique algorithm to pinpoint possible gas deposits, makes a find in Namibia's Kalahari Desert. While he's raised millions of dollars from investors and written off millions more in research costs through a number of state incentives, industry analysts remain cautious. Read more: Will South African trio's algorithm be a boon for oil sector? His UK-registered company Africa New Energies, which is expected to list on the London Stock Exchange next year, has yet to discover a single barrel of oil. Larkin launched the company in 2012 with Brendon Raw and Shakes Motsilili. At a Startup Grind event at Workshop 17 in Cape Town last night, Ventureburn questioned Larkin on the concern some analysts have over the company's claims it would find gas in the basin. He said since registering his company in 2012 a number of local Herero people have reported oil seeping out of 731 places across a million acres in the basin. However he stressed that while drilling was expected to start next year, the existence of any gas deposits in the Kalahari had not yet been proven. Despite this, he said the use of an algorithm -- which combines satellite images, aircraft photos and other data to determine such things as the depth and pressure of any gas -- can greatly increase the chances of a successful find, while keeping costs low. Based on its use in 100 basins and 6000 wells, the algorithm gave prospectors about a 70% chance of finding gas, he said. \"I'm not saying we'll get 70% (certainty)...  you'll get to the 70% probability over a 10 well-drilling programme,\" he said. \"But the bizarre thing is because the expected value of what we're talking about and we're talking free cash of US$20 billion, they (investors) are prepared to say, 'well if it doesn't work we're prepared to lose a certain amount'.\" Those that have helped fund the exploration include 400 investors from 17 countries who have committed R40-million, after Larkin raised an initial R1-million from 30 former school mates. The company has also raised about 2.5 million pounds (US$3.2-million) in the UK, he added. He also revealed to Ventureburn that Chinese investors are expected to put in a further $500-million, which will form the company's initial listing value. In addition to this, the company has also been able tap funding from South Africa's Support Programme for Industrial Innovation (SPII) fund, which falls under the Department of Trade and Industry, while having utilised research and development (R&D) tax credits in the UK after registering the company there. Added to this the company has received support from the German government, a deal in which Larkin says the German government will cover three quarters of the company's budgeted R&D spend but in which the company will be able to maintain ownership of its IP. He says the recent low oil price has driven interest by investors in the company's algorithm. \"What has amazed me is that we are starting to get bids where certain players are starting to get worried, because it's cheaper and it's better if it works. \"And a couple of them have got to a stage where they are trying to secure the algorithm before we strike. Because if we do there will be such a bunfight over it.\" However when questioned later by Ventureburn, Larkin admitted that there are other operators in existence that are using similar algorithms to prospect for oil. In response to an audience question on whether the company would use hydraulic fracturing to recover gas deposits, Larkin said he \"loathed\" fracking and added that his algorithm \"will destroy the economic justification for fracking\". However when probed further by Ventureburn on whether fracking would be involved in recovering the gas, he agreed that while it would be deployed, the algorithm would however limit the number of test wells that would need to be drilled. Larkin said he was contacted in 2011 by the then Namibian foreign minister Utoni Nujoma to build a solar park. However after carrying out a pre-feasibility study Africa New Energies advised that solar would be financially unsustainable. It's then, he says, that the company hit on the idea of prospecting for onshore gas to pay for the installation of solar. As a child Larkin, who is dyslexic, was told that he would need to go to a special school. But he said his scientist father would hear none of it. While at Marist Brothers College in Cape Town, a former headmaster of Bishops spotted his potential and offered him a chance to write a scholarship exam to enter the prestigious private school. The night before the final exam, his sister was beaten and thrown into prison by police who suspected her of being involved in radical left-wing politics at the time. \"She was in prison when I wrote that exam and I just let rip with left-wing vitriolic that would have made Karl Marx wince.\" Larkin was in luck because the regular marker, who was a conservative Afrikaner, was off work that day. \"They desperately needed to find someone to mark the exams and they found this hippy guy from the UK and he read this paper and he thought, 'wow this is alternative' and despite my four percent for Latin I won a Bishops scholarship.\" He recalls the time when his fellow room mate at his University of Cape Town residence, who was from one of the country's former homelands, told him that what he was most looking forward to doing at the university was studying at night. \"That day he basically made me work out what I wanted to do -- I wanted to give everyone else who didn't have electricity, electricity,\" he said. I was there and I do not remember Stephen saying that he will be fracking, do you have video fooage of him saying? Ventureburn focuses on startup news and technology trends in emerging markets.

The Desert Startup Bootcamp was co-founded by Mandela Washington Fellows Mhlanganisi Madlongolwana and Sam Beckbessinger. \"This is particularly close to my heart as I come from these communities where access to markets and mentors is a big challenge for startups,\" said Madlongolwana in a statement. The bootcamp will select 55 aspiring entrepreneurs from 180 applicants from Tshwane and will put them through a three-month \"experiential learning programme\". The entrepreneurs will meet for weekly workshops, mentoring, engagement sessions and pitching sessions to hone their products and presentation skills. All these activities will take place at the American Corner in Pretoria. The hub provides the participants with high-speed internet, equipment as well as digital resources to aid them during their time in the bootcamp. This will all be done in preparation for a pitching competition held in August which will be the foundation for the Desert Startup Bootcamp participants to build a larger client base, networks and to land possible investments. \"Together we'll create a vibrant culture of youth entrepreneurship that is 'plugged-in' to a national and international ecosystem of entrepreneurs, experts, industry leaders and mentors, whilst still recognising the local challenges that young entrepreneurs face in our market,\" said Beckbessinger, the other co-founder of the bootcamp.

    "content": "Andi Friedman is feeling \"energised and excited\" following a R16-million investment his startup Mobenzi received from Vumela Fund. Friedman said the Series-A funding served as a good recognition of all the hard work the company has done. He said the fund, which is managed by FNB and Edge Growth, took a significant minority stake in Mobenzi. The startup clinched the investment after taking part in one-on-one mentoring with accelerator and capital advisory firm Impact Amplifier. The accelerator provided the company with strategic support as well as other acceleration services. Mobenzi was founded in 2009 by Friedman and Pete Fowles. The two have developed a suite of products which include a range of flexible mobile apps and software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms. This suit can rapidly be configured to apply to a variety of sectors. Mobenzi's platform is aimed at those who work directly with customers and enables mobile interactions such as data collection and case management. The platform is also by nature, self-service while still providing a solid foundation for flexible turnkey solutions. An example of this is the Community Health Worker Service used in the Western Cape and the North West. \"We are excited to have the Vumela Team on board. We are at a critical stage of our growth, and having a long-term partner, which can help us scale and is aligned with our social mission, is imperative,\" said Friedman, earlier in a press release to Ventureburn. Impact Amplifier partner Maximilian Pichulik said Mobenzi will use the investment to help the company to build their suite of products and accelerate their expansion internationally. Pichulik said the accelerators was attracted by Mobenzi's commercial scalability and the company's strong focus and talented team. Edge Growth fund head Richard Rose added that the startup is an exciting addition to the fund's investment portfolio. \"Their software solutions will be a powerful enabler for job creation, and be globally competitive with the best out there.\" Featured image: James Lee via Flickr (CC 2.0, resize) ",

XL Africa will run over five months and startups will be put through a tailored curriculum, while receiving mentorship and the chance to attract early-stage capital of between US$250,000 and US$1.5-million. \"Digital startups are important drivers of innovation in Africa,\" said Makhtar Diop, the vice-president for the Africa Region at the World Bank, in a press release. \"To scale and spread new technologies and services beyond borders, they need an integrated ecosystem that provides access to regional markets and global finance. \"Pan-African initiatives like XL Africa play a critical role by linking local start-ups with corporations and investors across the continent,\" said Diop. The programme will kick off with a two-week residency in Cape Town where the selected startups will be able to interact with mentors, peers and local partners. The residency will then conclude with a venture showcase in which entrepreneurs will present their business models before an audience of corporations and investors. \"XL Africa aims to put a spotlight on the continent's growing digital economy by scouting for and supporting the most innovative tech startups,\" said Klaus Tilmes, the director of Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice at the World Bank. \"The success of these ventures will create a demonstration effect that can attract much needed growth investment in the sector and catalyse scaling of transnational businesses in the region,\" said Tilmes. XL Africa will collaborate with African investment groups such as the African Business Angel Network (ABAN), AngelHub Ventures, Goodwell Investments and Knife Capital. The accelerator will also be collaborating with Nest Africa, Silvertree Capital, Singularity Investments, SA Business Angel Network (SABAN) and many others. Corporate partners include Orange, .Eco, Ringier, and Thomson Reuters. \"By connecting innovative business ideas with the knowledge and resources available in the ecosystem, XL Africa will create a pipeline of investment-ready companies, unlocking better investment opportunities for regional and global investors,\" said Lexi Novitske, the principal investment officer for Singularity Investments. Companies wishing to apply can do so online before 12 June. ",

    "content": "Computicket's acquisition of local company Entry Ninja is an opportunity to take on new technology and to learn more, says the Pretoria startup's co-founder Frans Jooste. \"It's a lot of fun to see your product blowing up,\" Jooste, 29, told Ventureburn today on Computicket's purchase of the online sporting events portal. \"It's like seeing your baby growing up.\" Computicket on Saturday announced that it has acquired the startup for an undisclosed sum. Neither Jooste or Shoprite Holdings, which owns Computicket, would disclose the amount of the deal. Jooste said the startup was approached in May last year by the ticketing company, which was looking at expanding into sporting events. \"They (Computicket) took a look at our product and said they liked what they saw,\" he added. He said the idea is to integrate Entry Ninja into Computicket's online portal and its 1000 ticketing outlets. While Computicket has said it wanted five founders to remain in the company, Jooste said he and his partners were still \"smoothing out\" the details around their involvement going forward. \"From our side we just want to continue growing emotionally, mentally and financially,\" he added. Since starting out two and a half years ago, Entry Ninja has handled booking for about 460 events, mainly obstacle course and road running races like the Joburg 10k Cityrun and FNB Cape Town 12 Onerun. Jooste said Entry Ninja has its roots in a timing company started six years ago when his cousin -- co-founder Francois Jooste, 28 -- and his father were organising local sports events and battled to find a good company to handle the timing. It's then that the approached Frans, who was studying software development at the University of Pretoria at the time. He was joined by then fellow students Phillip Buys, 28 and Jaco van der Berg, 27. They then joined up with the founders of a local GPS timing company, before they split in 2014. The four along with George Boot, 25, formed Entry Ninja. which was registered the following year. While things began slowly, Buys helped the startup to secure the Toyota Warrior obstacle course race involving 10 000 weekend participants. \"That's when things boomed,\" said Jooste. From their initial focus on timing, the five turned to focus more on events booking which Jooste describes as more scalable than timing, which relies on timekeepers on the ground to expand. Despite this, the company timed 152 events last year, with timings captured using electronic tags. His advice to other entrepreneurs is to focus on one's core business and ensure one has tested one's idea thoroughly before adding any more products or services. \"Don't just try to build everything from day one -- try to pick three things and try to master them,\" he pointed out. Shoprite Holdings Deputy Chief Operating Officer Joseph Bronn said in a press release that the company had been actively looking to extend into event registration to better service its customers. \"Entry Ninja's service extends to different types of sporting events, plus it makes allowance for team entries and even offers event organisers a timing facility. \"It really is a one-stop solution,\" said Bronn.

    "content": "South Africa's downgrade to junk status earlier this month by two rating agencies may have depressed Michael Jordaan, one of the country's most respected venture capital (VC) investors, but he believes the downgrade is \"nearly irrelevant\" to startups. \"In this tough economic climate it is useful that one of the advantages of startups as opposed to big business is that the macro economics are nearly irrelevant as it is far more important for the startup to first succeed in its narrowly defined micro-market,\" said Jordaan in an email to Ventureburn. However, in a wide-ranging interview, the former head of First National Bank, now the founder of Montegray Capital, bemoaned the present glum economic mood in South Africa. He said the current political situation and the junk rating depressed him, adding that the economy could \"easily\" grow at 5% if \"the right, albeit sometimes tough decisions\" were taken. \"We could be creating so many jobs every year if we just followed growth strategies that have worked elsewhere instead of being ideological,\" he added. \"For example solar power is growing exponentially elsewhere but in sunny SA we seem intent on doing an unaffordable nuclear deal. And we pour money into a loss-making airline that the private sector could run at a profit.\" Jordaan said though he has had no interaction with the SA SME Fund he found it disappointing that the fund, chaired by Discovery CEO Adrian Core, appears to be taking its time to set up and begin investing. Read more: Exclusive: 'Government won't match private sector in R1.5bn SME fund' \"Ideally they should have been disbursing funds within 90 days of coming up with the concept, probably by partnering (with) established VCs in the industry who are all seeing more promising deals than they can fund,\" he said. He added that the government's decision not to participate in the fund is \"highly regrettable\", saying startups are crucial to solving SA's biggest problems, from employment to education. However he believed the Section 12J venture capital tax incentive launched in 2009 had made a difference and hoped that the \"inevitable\" teething problems with would be addressed. Jordaan said Montegray Capital has invested in 20 businesses, with 19 already listed on the fund's website. He added that the latest investment would be announced in due course so as not to alert the competition yet. He declined to disclose the size of his fund or how much he had invested so far, pointing out that he had no third-party investors and was managing his own monies. He could not disclose the number of directors or jobs created as he did no track these, but added that \"the first priority of every startup is just to survive so we focus obsessively on proving the business model, which is tough enough\". The fund, he said, is not exit-focused and added that he simply wanted to help entrepreneurs to build sustainable businesses. \"Some of the companies in which we have invested have raised subsequent funding in higher rounds but without us taking any money off the table. We prefer it that way too,\" he said. However he said all the tech firms that he is involved with are creating jobs and are continually looking for skilled employees. \"The biggest skills shortage is for software developers and I am very proud that one of our initiatives, CodeX is training 40 junior developers in 2017. With more industry support the model can easily scale to 400 or even 4000 in time. \"These are students from underprivileged areas that prove that they have the critical thinking and problem-solving skills required to become great developers and employees, despite a pretty bad primary and secondary education system.\" He said while there had been a growth in black Africans involved in tech startups, this was \"sadly off a low base\". \"In time CodeX hopes to make a difference here,\" he added. In addition he said the country should be more open to letting in foreigners with skills that can grow the economy. \"It is sad when our policies have scarcity thinking -- that skilled foreigners will take locals' jobs -- and not abundance -- that thriving businesses create many more new jobs,\" he said. Cape Town and Johannesburg have been recognised as the country's top startup centres, but Jordaan said rather than trying to mimic these cities, authorities from other urban centres in the country would benefit more by adding to the network effect that the two cities have already created. Jordaan is also involved in VC fund Angelhub Ventures and said the team receives and processes up to 10 applications a day. \"There is simply not enough time to have coffee with all the prospective startup founders so we have to follow a slightly more structured process, which is where Angelhub excels,\" he said. Recalling his first two venture deals, which he conducted when he was still employed, Jordaan said these \"did not work out\", adding that he'd rather not mention the companies involved. \"It takes quite a bit of (lost) money to educate a venture capitalist. Failure is inherent in startups and in the venture capital industry, so it is very different from banking where a four percent bad debt ratio would set off the alarm bells. \"Venture capitalists expect five out of 10 investments to go bang, three out of 10 to do okay but then have two that shoot the lights out,\" he said. With Jordaan's former employer FNB this week cutting its economic growth outlook for South Africa to 0.7% in 2017, down from the 1.3% forecast in the Budget in February, he will likely be hoping that the investing outlook won't prove as gloomy as the country's deteriorating economy.

    "content": "Digital All Stars is a series of articles which aims to celebrate the best of South African digital. The articles, which will appear on Memeburn and Ventureburn, recognise and celebrate South Africa's best digital entrepreneurs, business people, advertisers, and media professionals among others. In this piece we take a look at some interesting African startups involved in developing artificial intelligence (AI) solutions.  South African startup DataProphet last year received a significant investment of an undisclosed amount from Yellowwoods Capital Holdings to expand its international offering. As part of the deal, DataProphet will act as the advanced analytics partner for the group. The startup, based in Cape Town, has developed various machine-learning interventions, mainly for the finance and insurance sector. It has also added a number of large industrial and fast-moving consumer goods clients, some of which are international clients. Among the applications the startup has designed are a conversational agent for inquiries and a solution to detect emotion via image which has been integrated into a game for major Japanese publisher Bandai Namco. Daniel Schwartzkopff (pictured right, with co-founder Frans Cronje) says four years on the company has seen it now turning a profit and no longer relying on \"burning VC funds\". The company has 18 employees and Schwartzkopff says their immediate plans include fleshing out its product offering for the conversational agent and expanding overseas sales, primarily in the US (the company already has a sales office in San Francisco). \"It is very cost effective for US businesses to utilise DataProphet as we have a major cost advantage by operating out of SA,\" he adds.  Founded in 2011 by Dayne and Ryan Falkenberg (pictured here) and Mark Pederson, the Stellenbosch-based company uses virtual advisors on artificial intelligence platforms to advise sales and technical consultants. The platform has been adopted by a wide number of large organisations in the banking, insurance, telecommunications, oil & gas, software and electronics sectors. These clients typically have large numbers of staff dealing with sales, service and operations. Clevva has since its inception been entirely self-funded by the company's co-founders and directors. At present the company has a team of seven. The startup has been recognised by a wide range of industry bodies, including being showcased by Gartner in 2015 as one of six African Innovations and selected by Microsoft to be part of its BizSpark programme. Clevva is looking to expand globally, starting with the UK and Australia and then heading to the US in the next 12 to 18 months.  Founded by Benji Meltzer and James Paterson (pictured left and right, respectively) in 2014, Cape Town based Aerobotics develops AI systems for drones. The company uses AI to assist farming consultants in South Africa, Australia and the UK to analyse processed maps and extract actionable information to identify problem areas in crops such as wheat, macadamia nuts, citrus and sugar cane. This enables the company to develop variable rate fertilisation application maps and predict the yield of crops. \"We have built technology that goes as far as identifying and classifying individual trees (using computer vision and machine learning) and then additional algorithms that track each of these trees, with a number of metrics per tree (health, biomass, canopy area, etc) over time,\" explains Meltzer. So far, the startup, which has 11 employees and has previously been selected for Startupbootcamp Insurtech accelerator programme in London, has used its own funds to finance operations, but signed a term sheet in March for its first round of funding. \"The tech is at a point now where we're ready to scale operations and we're looking to build partnerships with major players in industry. In the future we'd like to explore additional industries that would be interested in this data,\" says Meltzer.  Nigerian startup Kudi.ai has developed a chatbot which allows users to make payments and send money to friends and family in Nigeria via messaging. The company is a graduate of the YCombinator Winter 2017 batch. Pelumi Aboluwarin (pictured above, left with co-founder Yinka Adewale) says the founders began working on Kudi in July last year. \"We registered an entity two months after and ran a private beta in December 2016. We launched publicly in January 2017,\" says Aboluwarin. The company has seven employees. The company uses AI to understand user requests, drive conversations, understand user spending habits and prevent fraud. \"We developed it in-house using a variety of machine learning techniques,\" says Aboluwarin. The startup has put together a business-to-business solution too, which it is piloting with banks and telecommunication companies. \"After YCombinator we've raised additional seed funding from a group of angel investors in the valley and in Nigeria,\" says Aboluwarin.  Founded by former equity-derivatives specialist Annabel Dallamore (pictured here) together with Julian Dallamore and Mark Karimov in 2013, Johannesburg startup Stockshop.co.za offers a number of artificial intelligence solutions to financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. These include a conversational user interface (a bot in its infancy) that match-makes available financial consultants or brokers with client leads. The startup has also developed a bot interface that completes real-time identity verification checks on behalf of banks and financial institutions in line with requirements under the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA). The startup has also developed a solution that uses an algorithm that pairs financial behaviour, spending and other data along with emotional cues and provides clients with assistance around financial matters such as payments, administration, rewards, education, analytics and tracking. It's also launched a micro-insurance platform in April that is unique to the African market. In 2013 the company received support from the Seed Engine accelerator and has raised funding from two angel investors and a venture capital fund, for an undisclosed sum. It now has 11 employees.  Nigerian startup Aajoh uses artificial intelligence to help individuals that send a list of their symptoms via text, audio and photographs, to diagnose their medical condition. The business was started in February last year -- by Simi Adejumo (who is the CEO and pictured above), Zuby Onwuta, Vikas Ramachandra, Ike Ilochonwu and Charles Ademola -- with an angel investment of $10 000. The company has two companies and 35 users signed up for its pilot programme. \"Our present go-to-market strategy involves getting companies to sign up to the platform as part of staff health benefits,\" says Adejumo. Adejumo said the app won't replace medical diagnoses but will allow doctors to make the best use of their time by allowing them to focus on the patients that need physical care. \"In frontier markets, there's a high patient to doctor ratio with Nigeria having a 4000 to one patient-to-doctor ratio, in proper context on the average an individual spends about 20 minutes with a GP, so assuming the population fell ill (all) at once, it would take over 55 days to get care,\" he says. The company's immediate plans are to grow its pilot programme and then expand to India. \"By August we aim to have implemented partnerships with key pharmacies across Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria and increased our user base to 1000.\" Ventureburn focuses on startup news and technology trends in emerging markets.

    "content": "Over $300-billion of oil and gas exploration projects have been shelved since the oil price fell from a high of $120 in July 2014 to a low of $25 in early 2015 -- but three South Africans' use of a statistical algorithm promises to cut the cost of finding oil and gas. While unlisted UK company Africa New Energies (ANE) recently became the subject of a bidding war with valuations of hundreds of millions of dollars, analysts remain cautious, with the company yet to discover a single barrel of oil. The company, launched by Stephen Larkin, Brendon Raw and Shakes Motsilili in 2012, uses data collected from satellites, aircraft and ground-based earthquake detection monitors to scope for oil and gas. ANE is backed by both the UN and the Namibian government, which has awarded the company a  22 000 square kilometre concession - an area larger than Gauteng. It plans to start drilling in 2018. Zak Mir, the media pundit who hosts TipTV in London said ANE's algorithm was the first technology innovation with a realistic chance of success to emerge after the industry slump -- with many exploration techniques still overly reliant on seismic methods, which were introduced in 1924. \"While there is a bit of a dot com feel to these rumours, I have no doubt that interest in ANE's technology will reach fever-pitch if its drilling programme in the Kalahari does deliver.\" Andrew Turpin, a former head of media relations at energy companies Iberdrola and Centrica and Indian oil refining group Essar, said ANE's algorithm materially improves the notoriously low probability of finding land-based hydrocarbons through drilling expensive test wells. The algorithm can prove even more valuable, he said, in that it enables remote desktop assessment of hundreds of potential hydrocarbon deposits across entire continents, making it possible for investors to rank prospects before they have set foot in the country. This can eliminate the risk of wasting billions on infrastructure. \"In a world where oil majors are paying $17 to replace each barrel of reserves using their internal geological teams and investor sentiment is moving away from mega-hydrocarbon projects, ANE's algorithm is a potential game changer,\" said Turpin. \"However, there is still a risk for any bidder looking at ANE. Nothing is proven yet and most bidders would want clarity that the Kalahari acreage contains more than just fossilised sea water,\" he stressed. Edward Stock of Artaois, the London-based independent energy markets consultancy said \"the industry is facing a dilemma as to where new reserves will come from. This is a time where investment into high-cost exploration in hostile environments is waning and the current focus on fracking is seen as uneconomical at the current prices. \"Technology that will increase the efficiency of exploration while providing returns at current levels should be attracting investment back into the sector.\" But Stock agrees with Turpin's caution. \"Nothing is proven yet, and ANE's unorthodox funding model constrains the amount of capital it can raise.  The company claims a prospective resource of 1.6 billion barrels -- so -- at ANE's forecast of $40 per barrel -- the outcome of its drilling campaign is one that the rest of the industry will be watching closely.\" ANE's South African country manager Shakes Motsilili was tight-lipped when asked to comment on the bids, stating that if any discussions were happening they tended to be drawn out over many months and would be subject to confidentiality. ANE CEO Stephen Larkin will be hosted by Startup Grind Cape Town on 25th April to talk about the potential for crowdfunding to galvanise other South African tech startups. ",
