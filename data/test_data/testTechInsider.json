Snap added just 8 million new daily users in the first three months of the year, representing year-on-year growth of 36%. At this time last year, Snapchat was growing its DAUs by 52%.

    "content": "Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. ERIC PIERMONT/AFP/Getty Images Uber is rolling out a simple but useful feature to its users called \"Saved Places\". The feature -- announced by Uber on Wednesday -- will allow Uber riders to bookmark places that they visit regularly, such as a friend's house or a favourite restaurant. \"Everyone has places they go again and again,\" Uber wrote on its website. \"But remembering those addresses is tough, and asking someone 'where's that again?' for the second, third, or even fourth time can be awkward. \"That's why we're adding a Saved Places feature to the app. Saved Places makes it easy to bookmark (and forget!) addresses so riders can get to the people and places they need to see faster. Riders can also name these addresses, even with emojis.\"Uber's Saved Places feature allows users to bookmark places they regularly visit.Uber Saved Places will be available in the US from Thursday on both Android and iOS. Uber said it will be expanding the feature to non-US users later in the year. Here's how to use the Saved Places feature, according to Uber: Once en route to a favorite place, riders should look for the option to save that address in the Uber feed. To access a saved address, tap \"Where to?\", and then \"more saved places\" and select from the list. A rider's Saved Places will even start to show up on their home screen \"shortcuts\" if we predict that's where they could be going, so they can get moving with just one tap. Riders repeatedly use Uber to get to just a handful of places - both for work and for fun. As you'd expect, in our early testing riders said that airports, hotels, and colleges are among the top use cases for this feature. Less expected however, they also mentioned their favorite taco and bagel shops, Grandma's house, karaoke, and even jiu-jitsu as other places they would save. The possibilities are endless! Saved Places is another way we're designing our app around riders, and our core beliefs that time is a luxury and the info you need should always be at your fingertips.",

    "content": "Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon LONDON -- Uber just got dealt a major blow in Europe. The Californian ride-hailing firm is a transportation firm and subject to local laws governing them, says Advocate General Szpunar, a key advisor to the European Court of Justice. The decision is non-binding -- but highly important. The European Court of Justice is currently deciding whether Uber is a transportation firm or a digital service, something that will have significant implications for how it operates on the continent. Uber, which does not own its own vehicles and whose drivers are technically self-employed, frames itself as a tech firm simply connecting independent drivers to passengers. But a binding ruling from the ECJ that it is a transportation business would subject it in some cases to stricter rules and regulations. The ECJ's judges do not always follow the opinion of advocate generals -- but they tend to. \"Taking account of the fact that the supply of transport constitutes, from an economic perspective, the main component, whilst the service of connecting passengers and drivers with one another by means of the smartphone application is a secondary component, the Advocate General proposes that the Court's answer should be that the service offered by the Uber platform must be classified as a 'service in the field of transport',\" the ruling says. \"It follows from that interpretation that Uber's activity is not governed by the principle of the freedom to provide services in the context of 'information society services' and that it is thus subject to the conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate transport services within the Member States.\" In short: Uber is a transport company, and needs to follow local laws on how other taxi and transportation firms operate -- which are often far stricter than those it currently follows. A protest against Uber by black cab drivers in London. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor In a statement, an Uber spokesperson said: \"We have seen today's statement and await the final ruling later this year. Being considered a transportation company would not change the way we are regulated in most EU countries as that is already the situation today. It will, however, undermine the much needed reform of outdated laws which prevent millions of Europeans from accessing a reliable ride at the tap of a button.\" The ECJ's binding decision is expected later this year. As Uber has expanded aggressively around the world, it has faced numerous lawsuits -- both in Europe and elsewhere -- over how it operates. Meanwhile, Uber is reeling from numerous scandals. A lawsuit from Waymo, Google's self-driving car unit, accuses the firm of stealing its tech. A former employee accused it of a culture of sexism, prompting an ongoing internal investigation. CEO Travis Kalanick was caught on video aggressively berating a driver after they complained about changes to pay. Numerous top executives have left the company.

    "content": "Automated marketing call? No thank you. Ben Carleton/Flickr (CC) Automated cold calls are one of the banes of modern life -- and they can also be illegal. A UK regulator has hit a company responsible for almost 100 million \"nuisance calls\" with a record fine of PS400,000. The Information Commissioner's Office announced on Wednesday that it was handing down the fine to a firm called Keurboom Communications, which made 99.5 million calls over an 18 month period on everything from PPI compensation to road traffic accidents. \"Keurboom showed scant regard for the rules, causing upset and distress to people unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end of one its 100 million calls,\" the ICO's head of enforcement Steve Eckerlsey said in a statement. \"The unprecedented scale of its campaign and Keurboom's failure to co-operate with our investigation has resulted in the largest fine issued by the Information Commissioner for nuisance calls.\" If you haven't consented to receive marketing cold calls, the caller is technically breaking the law, and they can be prosecuted. In April, Keurboom and its director pled guilty to \"failing to comply with an information notice,\" the ICO says. The firm was also hit with a PS1,500 fine, PS435.95 costs, and a PS120 victim surchage. The director faces a PS1,000 fine, PS435.95 costs, and a PS100 victim surcharge. The fine is a joint record, with the ICO hitting a company with a PS400,000 bill once before. That was UK telecoms company TalkTalk, which was fined for security failings over a hack that stole tens of thousands of customers' details. The previous largest fine for nusciance calls was to Prodial in February 2016, for PS350,000. Prodial was responsible for less than half as many calls as Keurboom -- just 46 million.",

    "title": "Apple isn't working on a car -- it's working on something that's much bigger than a car",
    "content": "That big screen in the middle of the dashboard looks useful.David van der Mark / Flickr, CCApple is behaving in a really strange way right now regarding the mythical \"Apple Car.\" After hiring 1,000 people to work on a secret program called \"Project Titan,\" which many believed to be the development of an \"Apple Car,\" the company laid off hundreds of them late last year. Observers interpreted that as one of Apple's periodic experiments: The company looked at what it would take to build a car, and then decided not to. And yet, Business Insider's Sam Shead recently discovered a secret Apple office in Berlin which -- sources tell us -- is devoted mostly to transportation. The engineers there were hired from car companies and some are working on mapping projects. So is Apple working on a car or not? UBS analyst Steven Milunovich hosted a conversation with Horace Dediu (of Asymco.com) and Neil Cybart (of AboveAvalon.com) recently. He asked them what they thought was going on inside Project Titan. They raised four issues: The $5 trillion size of the market is crucial. Apple can only go into massive markets if it wants to continue growing. Apple is so huge that those markets need to be in the multiple billions of dollars, otherwise there is no point. (Apple Watch, for instance, is the biggest wearable tech device on the planet and yet inside Apple's universe it has barely moved the needle.) The other key notion here is that Apple might be looking at \"a transportation platform ... the entire experience.\" It will need an iOS.Steve Jurvetson / Wikimedia CCThink about that. If the cars of the future are driverless, what will we do inside them as they ferry us around? We will need entertainment, communications, and work productivity apps to keep us occupied. Apple already does those on its other devices. The car itself will need navigation information, WiFi, broadband connectivity, and probably its own operating system. Apple already does those, too. Put that together with one other piece of gossip coming out of the Apple archipelago: That Apple is developing a smart speaker product with a screen that people can use in their home. Apple already does that -- it's called the iPad, and it has Siri. If there is a new opportunity for a standalone product in the kitchen that you yell at while you are cooking, then Apple is already steps away. Apple Homekit might be the embryonic seed of that. It would not be a huge reach to replicate the iPad/smart speaker/Homekit experience as a product that controls and operates your car, and gives you a familiar iOS-like interface to communicate with. Look at the dashboard of a Tesla (above). A huge chunk of it is basically just a computer screen. It is highly unlikely that Apple will let that new space go to waste.",

    "content": "David O'Reilly, BAT's director of science and R&D.;British American Tobacco.The buzzword du jour in boardrooms globally is \"innovation,\" with industries from banking to pharmaceuticals forced to contend with tech-driven disruption. Perhaps the most unlikely industry to face this grand wave of disruption is Big Tobacco -- a field where the menthol once passed as innovative. \"We are becoming a tech company,\" British American Tobacco (BAT)'s Dr. David O'Reilly told Business Insider during a recent tour of the company's research and development (R&D) headquarters in Southampton, England. Dr. O'Reilly is the group scientific and R&D director of BAT, the global cigarette giant known for brands like Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Benson & Hedges, Dunhill, and Rothmans. The company sold over PS14 billion-worth of tobacco products around the world last year. But the industry is changing. A Chinese pharmacist called Hon Lik invented the modern day e-cigarette in 2003 and in the 14 years since vaping has come from nothing to become a small but significant -- and fast-growing -- corner of the market. Now, \"innovation in next-generation tobacco products is a main priority\" for BAT, Dr. O'Reilly says. Like any other big business, BAT doesn't want to become this decade's Blockbuster -- a once great business made redundant by the march of technology. What's more, these new products could even provide a lifeline. Smoking rates in the developed world have been in decline for decades. New and novel products could help alleviate the impact of this. \"These are consumer electronic products,\" Dr. O'Reilly said gesturing at a table of BAT's vaping products. \"They have to look good as well as work really well.\" Business Insider went see how BAT is trying to build its future.

    "content": "Thomson ReutersSure, Snap had a disappointing quarter -- to say the least. But does one bad quarter equal a single-digit stock price? Brian Wieser thinks it should. After Snap reported Wednesday that it missed Wall Street's expectations for revenue, earnings and daily active user growth, Wieser, an analyst who covers the company for Pivotal Research Group, dropped his target price for Snap's stock to $9 a share and reiterated his sell rating on it. With the Snapchat provider's sales coming in light, Wieser revised down his long-term revenue outlook for the company and, in turn, his price target. While Snap's revenue drop was \"consistent with the company's prior guidance,\" he wrote, it \"nonetheless represents a surprising element of seasonality in the business, and risks of less growth ahead than we previously expected.\" The single digit price target, though just one analyst's opinion, is an embarrassing snub for the popular internet company which made its high-profile Wall Street debut just a few months ago. The company's shares got shellacked in after-hours trading Wednesday after Snap announced its results, falling more than 23% to approach their $17 March IPO price. But a drop down to Wieser's target would mark an even more marked decline. Wieser's bearishness on the stock isn't unexpected. His previous price target? $10 a share.

    "title": "Microsoft has an ambitious new plan to take on Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant",
    "content": "The Harman Invoke, a Microsoft Cortana-powered rival to the Amazon Echo.HarmanAmazon and Google have clearly staked their claims in the burgeoning market for virtual digital assistants -- Amazon's Alexa, especially, has become something of a phenomenon, with the Amazon Echo devices leading the market. But Microsoft, that other Washington-based tech titan, has its own plans to conquer the burgeoning market for voice. Just this week, Microsoft unveiled the Invoke, a Cortana-powered Echo rival, manufactured by Samsung subsidiary Harman Kardon. And at the Microsoft Build conference in Seattle on Wednesday, HP and Intel officially signed on to help create Cortana-based hardware, too, opening the door for, say, a Microsoft-powered competitor to Amazon's new Echo Show gadget. Plus, Microsoft officially opened up Cortana to outside apps, so you can tell it to order you a pizza from Domino's, for example. In the past, Microsoft has said that access to its vast storehouses of Microsoft Office and LinkedIn data will help set Cortana apart from the competition. At Microsoft Build, we got our first taste of what that future looks like, as a presenter used Cortana to pull LinkedIn information on the people in her next meeting, or to set a vacation auto-responder in their e-mail that also marked them out-of-office in her Outlook calendar. It's all part of one master plan, Microsoft Cortana general manager Marcus Ash tells Business Insider -- a plan to use Microsoft's existing 500 million active Windows 10 devices, its storehouses of data, and its best friends in the industry to win the voice wars. Cortana, which is built into just about every Windows 10 PC and tablet, now has 141 million monthly active users. With that beachhead, Ash says, Microsoft can now start to think about new ways to access Cortana. \"We have permission to go after other devices,\" says Ash. Key to Microsoft's approach, Ash says, is Microsoft doesn't care if you're using Cortana on a PC, a phone, or an Echo-style smart speaker. It similarly doesn't care if you speak your commands, or type them -- Windows 10 and the Cortana smartphone apps both support typing out your queries, instead of speaking them. It's more important to Microsoft that no matter how you use it, Cortana can deliver the information you need. Cortana is available on a plethora of devices.Microsoft \"We can set consistency across the experience,\" says Ash. \"We want customers to have the choice.\" The point of new gadgetry like the Invoke, says Ash, is simply to provide more of that choice, and new ways for people to interact with Cortana. That's where the deals with HP and Intel come in. As demonstrated by Amazon's new Echo Show, tech titans see a certain demand for voice assistants complimented by screens, the better to show you security camera footage or video chat with your friends. Ash agrees with the notion, saying that \"some things are just better on a screen.\" That's why Microsoft made Cortana available from the lock screen on its Surface Studio PC, so you can shout \"Hey Cortana\" at it from across the room -- basically turning the computer you might already have in your home into an Amazon Echo-like experience. Now, Ash says, Microsoft is letting its partners \"take the lead\" and put their own \"unique spin\" on other ways to interact with Cortana. Amazon's Echo Show demonstrates how video and voice assistants can go together.Amazon The Invoke is an example of that, Ash says: Harman's specialty is in audio, so the Invoke speaker has great sound quality, which is important given that it can make and receive Skype calls. Looking to the future, and merely speculating, HP could hypothetically make tiny touchscreen PCs running Windows and powered by Cortana. Intel, for its part, is helping with things like always-on sound processing. And as for why these hardware players should want to build with Cortana, he says, it all has to do with its strong belief in the cross-device experience. If a partner builds a Cortana-powered smart speaker, it means that it'll already integrate with the Cortana that's on those 500 million Windows 10 PCs, making the ecosystem better for everyone. Microsoft recognizes that some hardware manufacturers are already building Alexa-powered hardware, and perhaps even their own Alexa apps to go with it. Ash says that Microsoft is readying developer tools to help them bring over whatever investments with voice they have to Cortana, smoothly and easily. \"We want you to bring that over,\" says Ash.

    "title": "Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook is out-innovating Snap",
    "content": "Snap CEO Evan Spiegel (left) and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (right). Getty Images There's a bit of a feud going on between Facebook and Snap. After Snap CEO Evan Spiegel rebuffed Mark Zuckerberg's $3 billion offer for his company in 2013, Facebook started imitating Snapchat's features both in stand-alone apps and in its more established apps like Instagram. It also bought Msqrd about a year ago to take advantage of its Snapchat-style lenses that overlay graphics on users' faces. Facebook finally found success with Instagram Stories -- a blatant copy of Snapchat Stories -- which quickly amassed hundreds of millions of daily users in a matter of months. It quickly spread the format to its other big apps -- Facebook, Messenger, and WhatsApp. All of this led Spiegel's fiancee, supermodel Miranda Kerr, to ask, \"Can they not be innovative? Do they have to steal all of my partner's ideas?\" But Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook is innovating. \"I think we're a little bit late to the trend initially around making cameras the center of how sharing works. But I do think at this point, we're pretty much ahead in terms of the technology,\" he said on the company's first-quarter earnings call. Facebook's focus on the camera is bad news for Snap, a self-proclaimed camera company. Here's why. Snap's S-1 filing with the SEC says its strategy is basically to be more innovative than its competitors. It practically admits it has no moat other than its ability to create more innovative products. \"The best way to compete is by innovating to create the most engaging products,\" management writes. \"That's because it's difficult to use distribution or cost as a competitive advantage -- new software is available to users immediately, and for free.\" To be sure, Snap is full of creative minds -- including Spiegel himself -- that are excellent at generating new formats to share content like the original disappearing photo message function of Snapchat and Stories. The problem is that those innovations are quickly and easily copied. Snap getting mad at Facebook for copying Stories would be like ESPN getting mad at Fox Sports for copying the one-hour sports highlight show everyone knows as SportsCenter. Or CNN getting mad at MSNBC for using the \"octo-box\" of pundits to cover election night. If it works, it's going to get copied. And contrary to Snap's opinion that access to distribution can't be used as an advantage, Facebook is demonstrating that it most definitely can. Instagram Stories already has 200 million daily users, and WhatsApp Status -- the WhatsApp version of Stories -- has 175 million. Both are more than Snapchat's daily user total. While Snap has been extremely innovative with its photo and video sharing formats, filters, and lenses, it's going to be difficult for it to compete with Facebook in terms of better technology. Facebook is a much bigger company producing billions in cash every quarter. Additionally, it has many more users and much more content to test new AI algorithms on to produce better augmented reality experiences and improve computer vision for recognizing objects in photos and videos.

    "title": "Snapchat's user base is loyal, but that might not be enough",
    "content": "Snapchat maker Snap issued its first earnings report as a public company on Wednesday, and, well, it could've gone better. The company's stock plunged about 24% in after-hours trading, as of this writing, after revenues were lower than expected and, most importantly, user growth slowed. Snap says it added 8 million daily Snapchatters this past quarter -- that's good for a 36% year-over-year increase, and it's a higher number than last quarter, but it's down from the 52% increase in DAUs it had this time last year. One thing Snap could point to as a moderate success, though, is how Snapchat users appear to be more loyal than most. An App Annie report from last week found that a significant chunk of Snapchat users in the US, Snap's main market, don't use other social media and messaging platforms on a given day. As this chart from Statista shows, 46% of those users say they don't use Snapchat's chief rival, Instagram. Unfortunately for Snap, Instagram has 700 million monthly users, while Snapchat has 166 million daily users. And Instagram's Stories feature -- which is trying to squash Snapchat by more or less ripping it off -- is already said to have 200 million daily users itself. The fact that many Snapchat users are sticking with Snapchat is valuable. It is still growing, after all, and CEO Evan Spiegel made it clear on Wednesday that he's focused on the long-term. But if you see an uptick in pessimism toward Snap over the next few days, this'll be a big part of it. Mike Nudelman/Business Insider/Statista Get the latest Snap stock price here.",

    "title": "Evan Spiegel deflected a question about Snapchat's weak user growth by railing against the spammy practices of competitors",
    "content": "Snapchat CEO Evan SpiegelGettyOne of the most important Snapchat metrics that Wall Street is looking for is user growth, measured in daily active users. Snap revealed on Wednesday during its first public earnings report that user growth was weak: It had about 166 million active users, or about 8 million new users. That sounds fine, but it's lower than what Snap needs to show to justify its current valuation. Of course, the first question asked on Snap's earnings call touched on the DAU issue, and CEO Evan Spiegel was ready for it. He blamed the underwhelming results on comparisons to other companies that fudge their numbers with excessive notifications and other \"growth hacks.\" \"I'd like to speak a little to the DAU question, because it's a question we get all the time,\" Spiegel said. \"I think one of the reasons why it's such a popular question is because there's a lot of this thing in our industry called 'growth hacking' where you send a lot of push notifications to users or you try to get them to do things that might be unnatural, or something like that.\" Some commenters online saw that line as a reference to some techniques Facebook and Instagram use. Spiegel calls out IG and FB's \"growth hacking\" (like push notifications) to explain Snap's long-term growth plans Spiegel doesn't think that's a good approach for Snapchat. Instead, he redirected his answer to how Snapchat can increase the amount of time that users are spending in the app. He gave an example of how Snapchat avoided \"growth hacking\" in the past: \"If we had just in the beginning encouraged Snapchatters to add all their friends in the contact book, instead of just a few of them, they might feel really uncomfortable creating Snaps and adding them to their story because they wouldn't know who was actually watching,\" Spiegel said. The Snapchat puppy filter.Getty ImagesSpeigel said that if Snap focused on \"creativity,\" or making Snapchat easier and more fun to use, then the users would naturally follow. \"The way we talk about DAU growth at our company is as it pertains to creativity,\" Speigel said. \"The reason why [Snapchat Lenses] prompted such an explosion in creativity is it really lowered the barrier to creation on our service. People enjoy looking like a puppy and things like that,\" Speigel said. \"I think the more we're able to reduce friction from the creative process, more people will feel empowered to express themselves, and we believe that translates to DAU growth,\" Spiegel said.

    "content": "Nathan McAlone/Business Insider Snap CEO Evan Spiegel is really excited about Snapchat's new TV-like \"Shows,\" which he said Wednesday are \"drawing audiences of over 8 million.\" Snapchat's \"Shows\" are meant to be TV-quality videos that media partners like NBC and ESPN create for Snapchat, as opposed to videos repurposed from TV or other mobile platforms. These shows live in the \"Stories\" section of Snapchat, under the \"Shows\" header. Spiegel said Snapchat is getting about one of these per day right now, but that this will grow through the end of the year. Snap wants about 2-3 shows to go up on the app each day, by the end of 2017, Snap previously confirmed to Business Insider. A big piece of Snap's pitch to IPO investors in March was that Snapchat would be the place where TV advertising dollars would land, as they shifted to the digital realm. These \"Shows\" could be important for that goal, though Snapchat will be competing for consumers' viewing time with Facebook, YouTube, Amazon and Hulu, all of which are investing money in original content as well.

Snap Inc CFO Drew Vollero said the sale of Spectacles were the majority of the company's $8.3 million \"other\" revenue in Q1. The company generated $149.9 million in revenue overall in the first quarter of 2017. When Snap launched Spectacles in September, the camera-recording sunglasses were only available for sale through Snapbots, a traveling vending machine that would pop up in random cities. In the first quarter though, Snap made Spectacles widely available for the first time online. Vollero said that's turned into a \"modest\" business for the company, generating over $8 million in revenue for the company. At the selling price of $130, that suggests that Snap sold over 60,000 pairs of Spectacles during the quarter. However, that hasn't turned into too many people using them.

The calculator will also show you how much you will save over 30 years. If you decide the futuristic roof is for you, you can secure your order with a $1,000 deposit. The payment is fully refundable until you enter into an installation agreement with Tesla.

    "content": "Thomson Reuters The Trump administration is likely to expand a ban on laptops on commercial aircraft to include some European countries, but is reviewing how to ensure lithium batteries stored in luggage holds do not explode in midair, officials briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. Any expansion of the ban could impact U.S. carriers such as United Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group. Six U.S. and European officials said they expect the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to make an announcement but declined to say when. In March, the U.S. announced laptop restrictions on flights originating from 10 airports including in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey because of fears that a concealed bomb could be installed in electronic devices taken onto aircraft. Britain quickly followed suit with restrictions on a slightly different set of routes. One European official acknowledged that the expanded ban could affect flights to the United States from Britain. DHS spokesman Dave Lapan said Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly \"hasn't made a decision but we continue to evaluate the threat environment and have engaged in discussions with airline representatives and other stakeholders about the threat.\" Kelly will give a classified briefing on Thursday to senators about domestic threats and airline issues are expected to be discussed, a congressional aide briefed on the matter said. The U.S. laptop ban has affected direct flights to the United States by Royal Jordanian Airlines, Egypt Air, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways. One issue under discussion is how to ensure that lithium batteries in any large collection of devices stored in airplane holds do not explode in midair, officials told Reuters. European regulators have warned placing what could be potentially hundreds of devices in the hold on long-haul flights could compromise safety by increasing the risk of fire from poorly deactivated lithium-ion batteries. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that a United Nations agency has begun an effort to craft global guidance for the use of laptops and other portable electronics in passenger aircraft cabins after the bans upset airline passengers and Middle Eastern carriers. The International Civil Aviation Organization met on Tuesday to debate the issue after the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and other countries complained their airlines had been unduly penalized by the decision, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Airports and airlines in Europe have already been working on plans for a possible extension of the ban since the U.S. announced the first restrictions on larger electronic devices in the cabin, according to several industry sources. Issues that need to be resolved include how best to inform passengers of any new restrictions to keep disruption at airports to a minimum. On the operational side, measures such as stopping online check-in for U.S. bound flights or ensuring U.S. flights depart from a dedicated part of terminals are among ideas being mulled, although no decisions have yet been taken.

We knew it wasn't going to be cheap, but Tesla has provided potential customers with a calculator to get a sense of how much an installation for their homes would cost -- and how much it will actually return to their pocketbooks, long term. First, you have to think about roofs, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the team from SolarCity -- acquired by Tesla in 2016 -- clearly have. Musk wanted the solar roof to \"look better than normal roof and last longer than normal roof,\" as he explained on a conference call with the media on Wednesday. Ultimately, Musk wants homeowners to be so dazzled by their beautiful Tesla solar roof that they invite the neighbors over to gaze upon it with envy and awe. He could barely mask his disgust at the aesthetics of the roofs we've all been tolerating for decades. Seriously, a new roof is going to run the typical homeowner something like $10,000, give or take a few grand here and there depending on the house size, materials, location, and installation. Over a 30-year mortgage, you'll replace the roof at least once and possibly twice. It's a significant expense. But other than maintaining the value of the home, rather than really adding to it, a conventional roof adds nothing to the bottom line of the homeowner's balance sheet. The solar roof, on the other hand, will actually make you money. In my case, running the numbers on my house in New Jersey, about $5,000 over 30 years. That doesn't sound like a lot, but it's effectively free money and it tips the overall cost of the solar roof into negative territory. The roof comes with a $7,000 Powerwall.YouTube/VideoMisery Obviously, there may be some maintenance costs involved over three decades, so bear that in mind: we're talking about solar panels and related technology, such as a $7,000 Tesla Powerwall battery. In a state such as California, with more sunshine and costlier electricity, the money you make over time will be more substantial. The economics of the solar roof are quite appealing, and as far as the hefty up-front costs go, homeowners can always take out a home improvement loan and watch inflation and the appreciation in value of their house mitigate that expense over time. Beyond that, a Solar Roof homeowner can sign on for Musk's vision. \"What's the future we want?\" he asked. \"We want to look around and see roofs that are beautiful and that draw energy from the sun.\" Get the latest Tesla stock price here.",

The remarkably well-preserved armored dinosaur -- which was a new species -- bore an uncanny resemblance to an already existing fictional character: Zuul, from the 1984 film \"Ghostbusters.\" The dinosaur and fictional demon both have a \"short, rounded snout and prominent horns behind the eyes,\" according to a statement from the museum.

Not only is the skeleton almost completely intact, but large parts of the bony armor in the skin are still in its natural position,\" Dr. David Evans, Temerty Chair and Curator of Vertebrate Palaeontology at the Royal Ontario Museum, and leader of the project, said in a press release. Those well-preserved bones helped confirm that this is indeed a new species. \"I've been working on ankylosaurs for years, and the spikes running all the way down Zuul's tail were a fantastic surprise to me - like nothing I've ever seen in a North American ankylosaur,\" said Dr. Victoria Arbour, the lead author of the study. \"It was the size and shape of the tail club and tail spikes, combined with the shape of the horns and ornaments on the skull, that confirmed this skeleton was a new species of ankylosaur.\" It's been a good week for dinosaur discoveries. On May 9, researchers published a study identifying for the first time a creature that was discovered 20 years ago. It made the cover of National Geographic magazine at that time, but its species didn't get determined until now. That dinosaur, a type of giant oviraptor, resembled an ostrich and was about 25 feet long. It has been officially dubbed Beibeilong sinensis, or \"baby dragon from China.\" The \"baby dragon\" fossils are 90 million years old, so the two newly named dinos were not contemporaries and lived in different locations. But if they had ever come into contact, it's safe to say that Zuul's armor and tail could have helped protect it from the giant birdlike predator.",

    "title": "Why Netflix's CEO is waging a war at the most prestigious film festival in the world",
    "content": "Reed Hastings. Flickr When two Netflix titles, Boon Joon-Ho's \"Ojka\" and Noah Baumbach's \"The Meyerowitz Stories,\" were added to the esteemed competition lineup for this year's Cannes Film Festival, it was another notch in the belt for the streaming giant. But it was also another moment when the movie industry felt that Netflix is hurting the theatrical movie business. Now Cannes, the most prestigious film festival in the world (running May 17-28), has decided to tweak its competition rules after this year as a result of the backlash toward the Netflix titles. On Wednesday, the festival announced that beginning in 2018, a film can only qualify for its competition lineup if it has a theatrical release in France. Netflix has made many enemies in the movie business for rarely having theatrical releases for its movies, and when it does release films in theaters, it does so while simultaneously making them available streaming on Netflix, therefore undercutting the reason to go to a theater. It's unclear if \"Ojka\" or \"The Meyerowitz Stories\" will play theatrically in France. \"The festival is pleased to welcome a new operator which has decided to invest in cinema but wants to reiterate its support to the traditional mode of exhibition of cinema in France and in the world,\" a statement from the festival said. \"Consequently, and after consulting its members of the board, the Festival de Cannes has decided to adapt its rules to this unseen situation until now: any film that wishes to compete in competition at Cannes will have to commit itself to being distributed in French movie theaters. This new measure will apply from the 2018 edition of the Festival International du Film de Cannes onwards.\" Netflix CEO Reed Hastings responded to the ruling with an aggressive Facebook post saying, \"the establishment closing ranks against us.\" \"Theatre chains want to block us,\" he added about the exhibitors that have issues with how Netflix does business. This is the latest chapter in the tug of war Netflix has between delivering content to its subscribers and trying to build clout within Hollywood. Here Netflix has a major difference with its chief rival Amazon Studios, which has released its movies in a traditional manner, with exclusive theatrical windows before making titles available to stream. Amazon won two Oscars earlier this year with its acclaimed drama \"Manchester By the Sea.\" Netflix struck out with an award-season hopeful in 2015, \"Beasts of No Nation.\" It was blacklisted by most theater chains because it played in theaters while streaming simultaneously. It will be interesting to see if the streaming giant will change course in its exhibition plans of the anticipated \"The Irishman,\" Martin Scorsese's movie starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino that Netflix acquired. In making an award-season push, will it play by the industry's rules? Since the movie probably won't come out until 2019 (it begins shooting in August), Netflix has some time to figure out a game plan.",

    "title": "Tesla just opened up orders for its Solar Roof -- here's how much it will cost you",
    "content": "CEO Elon Musk with a Tesla Solar Roof tile.Tesla * Tesla opened up orders for its Solar Roof product on Wednesday. * The company says the roof will cost about $21.85 per square foot. * Installations in the US will begin this year on a first-ordered, first-installed basis. * You can secure your order on Tesla's website with a $1,000 deposit. Tesla opened up orders and announced pricing information for its Solar Roof product on Wednesday. \"The typical homeowner can expect to pay $21.85 per square foot for Solar Roof and benefit from a beautiful new roof that also increases the value of their home,\" Tesla said in a statement. The company also launched a calculator to show people how much it would cost to replace their roof with a Tesla Solar Roof. It uses information like the size of the roof, the average local price of electricity, and how much sunlight a neighborhood receives during a year to calculate the price. Consumers in the US can secure their Solar Roof order now on Tesla's website with a payment of $1,000. Tesla's Solar Roof uses both solar and nonsolar tiles, which allows consumers to choose how many solar tiles they need based on their home's electricity consumption, the company said. Tesla's estimate of $21.85 per square foot is based on a roof that's 35% solar tiles. CEO Elon Musk said most roofs would likely be around 40%, but depending on the home, it could be 70%. To help put the cost into perspective, a Tesla Solar Roof for a home needing 3,000 square feet of roofing would cost more than $65,000 if 35% of the tiles were solar. According to Consumer Reports, a slate-tile roof for a home the same size would cost about $45,000, and an asphalt roof would be about $20,000. Tesla said that while the cost of its nonsolar tiles was comparable to that of regular roofing tiles, the initial cost of its solar tiles was more expensive. However, it said the cost would be offset by the value of energy the tiles produce. Tesla's roof will also come with a lifetime or \"infinity\" warranty, and Tesla is guaranteeing solar-power generation for 30 years. Musk said during a press call Wednesday that besides offering energy savings, its product would look better than any other roof replacement available. \"When you have this done, you will have the best-looking house in the neighborhood,\" he said. \"I think the aesthetics are really that good.\" Tesla People can now order the smooth black glass shingles and textured-glass shingles for their Solar Roof. The Tuscan and French Slate shingles should be available by early 2018, the company said. Tesla unveiled its solar shingles at a press event in October. Musk said at the unveiling that Tesla had established a glass division and that it had worked with SolarCity to design the product. Tesla acquired SolarCity in November in a deal worth $2.1 billion. At the event, Musk said Tesla's roof would price competitively with normal roofs and could even cost less. \"It's looking quite promising that a solar roof will actually cost less than a normal roof before you even take the value of electricity into account,\" Musk said at the event. \"So the basic proposition would be: Would you like a roof that looks better than a normal roof, lasts twice as long, costs less, and, by the way, generates electricity? It's like, why would you get anything else?\" But in Tesla's blog post on Wednesday, the company said its Solar Roof would be more affordable because it generates energy. \"Solar Roof is more affordable than conventional roofs because in most cases, it ultimately pays for itself by reducing or eliminating a home's electricity bill,\" Tesla said.

    "title": "The man plotting California's secession quit and moved to Russia -- here's what's next for the movement",
    "content": "Californians celebrate the US Supreme Court's rulings on the state's Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act in June, 2013. REUTERS/Noah Berger In April, the leader of a major California secessionist group announced he was abandoning the movement and settling permanently in Russia. The news was not that surprising. Louis Marinelli, the self-appointed leader of Yes California, set up a makeshift embassy (which he said would be used to promote the secessionist movement) in Moscow in December. Russia has a long-standing tradition of encouraging foreign fringe groups like California separatists in order to exploit tensions in the West. Some pronounced the \"Calexit\" campaign dead in Marinelli's absence. But a small group of Californians has vowed to take up the effort. The California Freedom Coalition (CFC), formed earlier this year, is on a mission to establish California as an independent nation through legal and constitutional means. In the short term, it wants to raise awareness in communities across the state of why secession makes sense for Californians. \"I think after this election, a lot of Californians realized we just would like to go on their own. Deal with our own stuff. Develop our world, develop our lives and develop our environment the way we want to,\" Timothy Vollmer, chief state gist of the CFC, told Business Insider in April. Califonia helped give the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, handing Clinton four million more votes than Donald Trump. But it didn't make a difference in the end. Vollmer said the US government has been architected in a way that puts California at a disadvantage. \"In some ways, the people who back the Electoral College 'cause they say, 'Otherwise, big states would dominate the national process,' are correct. They're right. If there was no Electoral College, then all the action would be in California, Texas, and New York,\" Vollmer said. \"But the answer to that cannot be the stripping of California's voting rights. We deserve to have a voting system -- a national political system -- in which we participate,\" he added. Vollmer, a former professor at University of California, Berkeley, and a community organizer for gay advocacy groups in San Francisco, attended a few meetings put together by Yes California organizers around the time of Trump's inauguration. After learning of Marinelli's ties to Russia, he said it \"became apparent that the Russian element would bring [the campaign] down.\" He kept in touch with small, grassroots secessionist groups forming across the state. Eventually, he teamed up with a handful of other Calexit backers to create the CFC. As the group's chief strategist, he's tasked with overseeing logistics (the group in the process of registering as a non-profit) and community education. The group -- whose board includes a principal manager at Think Big Analytics, a mid-sized Silicon Valley data company, and anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan -- meets every week. It's planning a march on Sacramento on May 19 to raise awareness of the cause. Support for California's secession began long before Trump took the White House and has been growing since. A much-publicized Reuters poll in January and a UC Berkeley IGS Poll in March suggested as many as one in three Californians want the state to become its own nation. Vollmer is optimistic that those numbers will grow amid growing discontent with the Trump administration. He's tired of waiting around to see what the president will do next and says working with the CFC makes him feel like a proactive member of society. \"To be against something is exhausting,\" Vollmer said. \"To be for something is exhilarating.\"",

    "title": "How Amazon is crushing rivals like Walmart in a burgeoning tech war over the future of retail",
    "content": "Amazon CO Jeff BezosGetty Earlier this year, engineers at Walmart who track rivals' prices online got a rude surprise: the technology they were using to check Amazon.com several million times a day suddenly stopped working. Losing access to Amazon's data was no small matter. Like most big retailers, Walmart relies on computer programs that scan prices on competitors' websites so it can adjust its listings accordingly. A difference of even 50 cents can mean losing a sale. But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programs - known commonly as robots or bots - thwarted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. Its technology unit, WalmartLabs, was unable to work around the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon's data through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The previously unreported incident offers a case study in how Amazon's technological prowess is helping it dominate the retail competition. Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalog and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success. Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. \"Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard,\" said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View, California-based Boomerang Commerce. A Walmart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode but said the company improves its technology regularly and has multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store pickup and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any \"campaign\" to stop them. \"Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site,\" she said. Still, she said, \"we prioritize humans over bots as needed.\" Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers to block them. Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how they are deployed, including current and former Walmart employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issues publicly. Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot wars. The company's technological edge has been good for its profit margin, and it's proving a winning formula for investors. Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since the market's bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales in 2015 - faster than any company in history, it said. Amazon's new bookstore in Chicago.Daniel McMahon/Business Insider Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more than a decade ago. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap labels by hand. In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals' pricing data. To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods including bots to ensure they do not lag others' price moves for even 20 minutes. \"That's like a lifetime during Christmas,\" said Chief Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like toilet paper and pet food. \"If we're not decently priced, we'll see it almost immediately\" in sales declines. Using bots to view massive amounts of data on public websites - a process known as crawling or scraping - has many purposes. Alphabet's Google, for example, constantly crawls the web to gather information for its search engine results and to sell ads. In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors' defenses. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy retailers. To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what's known as a \"CAPTCHA\" - typically a distorted string of letters and numbers that humans can read but most bots can't. Amazon shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers. For merchants seeking to evade such defenses, disguising their computer programs as real shoppers is key. Some pricing technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a barrage of clicks to a single source. \"It is an arms race,\" said Keith Anderson, a senior vice president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in Ireland. \"Every week or every month, there's some new approach from both sides.\" Amazon's maneuver that halted Walmart in January took aim at a specialized web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say, Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for programmers - a telltale clue that its users are not typical shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with the situation. It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Walmart in particular, affected other companies. Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among major U.S. retail chains, Amazon had by far the most sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change price frequently - a De'Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech webcam. The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks, which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil programmed bots to hit each retailer's website 3,000 times, but slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon. Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that Amazon's price for the De'Longhi espresso machine changed four times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of April 25, according to price tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more than 10 percent, from a low of $80.06 to $88.16. FILE PHOTO: A zoomed illustration image of a man looking at a computer monitor showing the logo of Amazon is seen in ViennaThomson Reuters Despite Amazon's capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80 percent of the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots, people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third or more of the traffic on other large sites. In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic includes bots from university researchers studying competition, search engines, advertising services and even fraudsters trying to break into Amazon accounts. For Walmart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India and around the world handle the code, current and former Wal-Mart employees said. Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and organize rivals' data with bots as of several years ago, one of the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or structure of its teams working with bots. According to one U.S. patent application, Amazon is working on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans, to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its web pages. \"Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and the wherewithal to do something about it,\" said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. That \"isn't the case for most retailers.\" Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions. Read the original article on Reuters.

    "title": "The charter network behind the best American public high schools shares its secret for success",
    "content": "Students at the BASIS Oro Valley location in Tucson, Arizona. BASIS Charter Schools There was a clear pattern running through this year's list of America's best public high schools, compiled by US News & World Report. It wasn't that four of the top five schools are located in Arizona -- though that does happen to be true. It's that those four schools, and one other in seventh place, are all run by a charter school network founded by two economists nearly 20 years ago. At a time when both the president and his secretary of education decry the state of US public schools, instead promoting private education, BASIS charter schools seem to offer a successful middle ground. The network's focus on high-quality teachers and big expectations for students suggests public funds can produce not just good private schools (as is the case with vouchers) but top public ones. \"There's really no part of K-12 education in the United States that's leading and beating the world,\" Mark Reford, BASIS's Chief Business Development and Brand Officer, tells Business Insider. \"Actually, probably except us.\" The top three BASIS schools in US News & World Report's latest ranking, created using a combination of test scores and participation on Advanced Placement tests, had graduation rates of 100%, 98%, and 97%, respectively. Nearly a quarter of the student body goes on to attend colleges in the top quarter of nationally-ranked universities. More than half attend those in the top 100. Charter schools are essentially public schools that are privately-run, either for profit or not. (BASIS schools are for-profit, run by the corporation BASIS Educational Group LLC.) They can't legally screen kids for acceptance, but they do have more freedom to stick to a mission that deviates from traditional public schools. Science students at the BASIS Oro Valley location in Tucson, Arizona. BASIS Charter Schools Reford says BASIS sets itself apart first by holding teachers in high regard, treating them as white-collar professionals that have autonomy in the classroom. Teachers are encouraged to pursue whatever it takes to get kids excited about Latin or physics. If one teacher's experimental approach is successful, BASIS will often adopt it in other schools in the network, Reford says. The method goes back to 1998, when BASIS was first founded by Arizona-based economists Michael and Olga Block on the premise of building schools based on the leading education research. The approach bears a resemblance to the one found in Finland, where national test scores have been some of the world's highest for years. But with teachers' freedom comes a high bar for expertise. All subject teachers, even the first-grade teacher doing simple addition and subtraction, must have a college degree in their chosen subject. The expectations are high for students, too. In addition to their normal standardized testing, they take internal exams each year beginning in sixth grade and lasting through high school. They're also required to take at least six AP courses and pass at least one test. To help students stay on track, BASIS takes a decidedly low-tech approach. Starting in kindergarten, each student receives a daily planner at the beginning of the year, known as a \"communications journal,\" meant to log homework assignments and serve as a repository for teachers' notes. In many schools, teachers publish kids' grades in an online portal that parents can check at will. Reford says the schools avoid these online gradebooks because they put too much power in adults' hands at the expense of student responsibility. \"We feel it's absolutely crucial to the kids' learning to take ownership of their own education because they have to write down their homework, their assignments in that communications journal,\" Reford says. Science students at the BASIS Oro Valley location in Tucson, Arizona. BASIS Charter Schools School demographics may skew achievement, however. Like many charters, BASIS has fewer minority students, those receiving free- or reduced-priced lunch, and those with disabilities compared to traditional public schools, the Washington Post reports. Prior research has found socioeconomics often play a deciding role in student success. In Arizona, at least, data from 2015-2016 school year show white and Asian students are considerably over-represented relative to the state's population. Arizona is 3% Asian, yet BASIS had 32% Asian students during that school year. Meanwhile, the state was 45% Latino, but BASIS was 10% Latino. Linda Lyon, president-elect of the Arizona School Boards Association, says the ratios may be by design. \"BASIS and other for-profit charters are really good at penetrating affluent markets where they can recruit already high performing students from district schools,\" Lyon told the Post. Reford disputes the idea that BASIS schools segregate kids. He contends the schools tend to have different racial distributions based mainly on where those kids live, even if the prior school year data suggests otherwise. He also highlights that BASIS's minority students still outperform their peers in local public schools. Ultimately, Reford says the controversy detracts from a more pressing issue -- namely, that American students underperform compared to other countries on the global stage. Standardized test scores lag well behind other industrialized nations, and they have for awhile. While much of the education world focuses on uplifting lower-achieving kids, BASIS believes high-achieving kids need special attention, too, Reford explains. \"You can't have a really good education without that high level of cognitive challenge,\" Reford says. \"And I think if you start with that, that's as good a place as any.\"",

    "content": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. AmazonPhilip's Hue bulbs are my favorite smart-home accessory, but they're definitely an investment. A Philips Hue starter kit, which includes three bulbs and a smart hub called the Hue Bridge costs $200, which is enough to make the prospect of buying even more bulbs in the future seem unlikely. Thankfully, that's not the case. I've been looking into buying some more bulbs, and found out that Amazon sells spare Hue bulbs in reasonably priced two and three packs. There is a small catch. These aren't the \"color ambiance\" bulbs that come with the starter pack I mentioned earlier. They're white bulbs, so you'll only be able to adjust their brightness; you won't be able to change the color of these bulbs. That said, there are certain rooms in a house where white bulbs would be more appropriate than fun, off-the-wall, color-changing bulbs. Other than their lack of color-changing ability, these are the same bulbs you received in your starter pack, meaning they're just as smart. You can control them using Philips' Hue app on your phone, or by using your voice with an Amazon Echo. I mentioned that these multi-bulb packages were inexpensive, but you may be wondering how inexpensive. A two-bulb pack costs $30, while a three-bulb pack will cost your $40; that works out to $15 per bulb and $13.33 per bulb, respectively. That's still more expensive than a pack of regular LED light bulbs, but highly affordable when compared to other smart bulbs. The Hue Bridge can support up to 50 bulbs at a time, so if you've made the initial investment in their technology, it's worth sticking with them. Smart bulb prices will continue to fall over time, but these multi-bulb packages are the best deal I've seen in this space so far. This article was originally published on 1/31/2017.

    "content": "President Donald Trump meets with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Russian Embassy President Donald Trump met with a key figure at the center of the probe into Trump's campaign, Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak, and the only official transmission of the moment came from an official Russian government photographer. In a tweet on Wednesday, the Russian embassy in the US and other Russian agencies released photos of Trump meeting the Russian ambassador, whose discussions with former national security adviser Flynn about US sanctions on Russia helped push Flynn to resign within weeks of coming onto the job. The photo opportunity came during Trump's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the White House on Wednesday, which was closed to press. Aside from official members of the meeting, the only two other people present were an American photographer and a Russian photographer. An official White House readout of the meeting omitted Kislyak's presence at the meeting. Kislyak's surprise appearance at the meeting surprised many media outlets, who discovered his presence when Russian media shared the photos. The White House has refused to revive official visitor logs instituted under President Barack Obama. A White House official told the official pool reporter that the only media present for Trump's meeting were official Russian and US government photographers.

    "content": "A rendering of the Amazon's new Seattle office building (right) that the company will share with a homeless shelter facility. Graphite/Amazon In 2016, Amazon bought an old motel in downtown Seattle, Washington, and turned it into a temporary shelter for the homeless. The lease only extends through October 2017, when the building will be demolished to make way for two new Amazon office towers. But now, Amazon will give the shelter a permanent home. On May 10, the company announced it will devote half of one of the six-story office buildings to the shelter, called Mary's Place. Construction on the two towers will start this fall, and they're set to open by 2020. The project -- which will cost tens of millions of dollars -- is one of Amazon's biggest philanthropic ventures to date, according to The New York Times. Amazon's Mary's Shelter in Seattle, Washington. Amazon In 2016, Amazon purchased the land that the former motel sits on, and partnered with nonprofit organization Mary's Place and the Seattle Mayor's office to run the shelter. The building (pictured on the right) is a former Travelodge motel in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle, near Amazon's headquarters. The company's CEO, Jeff Bezos, also donated $1 million to Mary's Place as part of the project. The current shelter can house up to 20 0 people and features 60 rooms, which each have bathrooms and showers. The new, 47,000-square-foot space will be a little larger. About 220 people in 65 rooms will be able to live there. As in the current shelter, rent and utility will be free, and residents will need to meet housing goals, like filling out employment applications, scheduling interviews, and enrolling in school or job-training programs. \"Mary's Place does incredible, life-saving work every day for women, children, and families experiencing homelessness in the Seattle community,\" Bezos said in a press release. \"We are lucky to count them as neighbors and thrilled to offer them a permanent home within our downtown Seattle headquarters - Amazon employees and Mary's Place residents will move in together in early 2020.\" In the meantime, the Mary's Place residents will move to another temporary shelter next door until the new one opens. Inside Amazon's Mary's Shelter in Seattle, Washington. Amazon Seattle is suffering from a homelessness crisis, which led the city's mayor to declare a state of emergency in 2015. More than 10,000 people are homeless in Seattle's King County area, with over 4,000 living on the streets, the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness estimated in a 2016 report. Moving Mary's Place into its new office building could help Amazon's reputation, especially in Seattle. In recent years, anti-gentrification activists have criticized the company for driving up real estate costs and making downtown less diverse. When Amazon's new 10 million-square-foot campus opens by 2020, it will take up 15% of Seattle's inventory.

    "title": "Fox just put the guy who wants to blow up TV advertising in charge of sales",
    "content": "Mike Coppola/Getty Images Joe Marchese, president of advanced advertising products at Fox Networks Group, has warned that TV networks \"bombard\" people with too many ads. In fact, he's advocated for giving people the choice to watch fewer ads during network TV shows. He's even advocated for consumers to use ad blockers. Yet on Wednesday, Marchese was named president of advertising revenue for Fox Networks Group, which includes the Fox broadcast network, FX and Fox Sports 1 (though not Fox News, which is run separately). The executive, who joined the company after Fox parent 21st Century Fox acquired his ad tech startup TrueX in late 2014, now has to figure out how to keep revenue in linear television amidst ratings declines, cord cutting and the explosion in often ad-free video streaming. Essentially, Fox is putting the person who's been urging the broadcast TV industry to drastically rethink its business model -- or risk alienating a new breed on binge-viewing consumer -- in charge of all of its ad sales operations. \"I'm the guy who has said, media organizations used to be just about about maximizing revenue,\" he told Business Insider on Wednesday. \"TV used to just compete against other TV companies. Now it's about fixing viewing experience. If you are just trying to maximize revenue [by shoving more and more ads into TV shows], people will say, 'forget it I'll watch Netflix.'\" The fact that Fox is putting the mavericky Marchese in such a role likely signifies that the TV giant recognizes the stakes it is facing, as TV consumption patterns -- and people's tolerance for ads that interrupt their viewing -- goes through continued upheaval. \"We're in the audience business, not the ad business,'\" he added. That said, the ad business has been pretty good to traditional TV companies; eMarketer predicts markets will spend over $72 billion on TV ads in the US this year. Marchese was quick to point out that people still watch over four hours a night of TV on average, and that despite the explosion in web video consumption, he was willing to bet that no single piece of web content attracts an audience that would approach \"any old Tuesday\" on TV. \"The industry as a whole has to have a perspective on what are we going to look like in three years,\" he said. \"I've been vocal about change. But we need to have a nice balance. Let's not go saying 'everything is different now.' Let's have a real conversation. Things are changing. But not all at once.\" Still, Marchese is pushing for new ad formats and fewer ads -- particularly on video-on-demand platforms -- where Fox shows like \"Empire\" see huge spikes in viewership after they air live on TV. He's also bullish on experimenting with more targeted, \"dynamic\" ads as more people watch live TV over the web via skinny bundle services like Sling TV and the recently announced Hulu 50-channel streaming package. The bet is that Fox and other networks may be able to charge more for ads that are delivered to specific audiences -- like new parents-- or at least that advertisers will start seeing better results from running such targeted ads. It's still very early in TV's race to cater to cord-cutters. For now, Fox needs to get out in front of revamping TV advertising while still protecting its golden goose. \"We need to have less interruption in advertising,\" he said. \"Consumers have said that. Our job to get there.\" Fox has been without a top sales executive since September. The company is holding its more annual 'upfront' presentation to advertisers in New York next Monday.",

    "content": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Flickr/alejandropintoOne of most common sources of frustration for computer users is running out of space. It's a pain to shuffle your files back and forth between cloud services and external hard drives, but buying a new computer isn't always an option. MacBook Air owners can't upgrade many parts of their laptop, but tech-accessory maker Transcend offers storage upgrade kits that cost far less than a new Mac. These kits include an SSD (Solid State Storage) module, two screwdrivers, and an SSD enclosure. The inclusion of the screwdrivers and enclosure make this kit easy to recommend because it shows Transcend was thinking ahead. Opening a MacBook Air is difficult because Apple uses uncommon screws, and most people don't have the right tools. The drive enclosure, which looks like a flash drive with a USB port on it, serves two functions. The first is to hold your new SSD, so you can easily connect it to your computer and transfer all of your data. Once you've installed your new SSD, you can keep your old one in the enclosure and use it as external storage. It's a win-win. You end up with an upgraded computer and an external drive you can use for backups. Any computer upgrade requires a certain level of technical proficiency and confidence, so if the idea of opening up your MacBook Air fills you with dread, reach out to a tech-savvy friend or local computer store. That said, Transcend gives you all the tools you'll need, and the product page for its kits has a very thorough video tutorial. It walks through every step of the upgrade process very clearly, and if followed closely, the whole process should be seamless. I've listed which drive is compatible with which machines below, but be sure to double check Transcend's product pages and your computer's \"About This Mac\" tab before buying one. They may not be cheap, but these drives should help you get an extra couple of years out your current machine. It might be impossible to upgrade every part of your old MacBook Air, but if you're constantly running out of space, this is something you should strongly consider. **Works with Late 2010 - Mid 2011 MacBook Air** **Works with Mid 2012 MacBook Air** If you want to see more from Insider Picks, we're collecting emails for an upcoming newsletter.

    "title": "Thousands of identical messages attacking Obama's net-neutrality rules have been suspiciously flooding the FCC website",
    "content": "A sample of the apparent spam messages. Jeff Dunn/Business Insider/FCC Tens of thousands of identical messages calling for net-neutrality rules to be repealed have flooded the Federal Communication Commission website's public comments section, throwing more chaos into the agency's effort to tackle a controversial internet policy. The barrage of identical messages, which appeared in the last three days, have raised questions about whether the comments represent legitimate public feedback on the FCC's proposed rules or whether the messages could be the work of automated computer \"bots.\" And the anti-net-neutrality messages come on the heels of an effort by TV personality John Oliver to mobilize his viewers to flood the FCC website with messages supporting the Obama-era rules. At issue are current rules that classify internet service providers like Comcast and Verizon as public utility-like \"common carriers\" under Title II of the Communications Act. Those rules legally prevent ISPs from blocking, throttling, or prioritizing certain traffic on their networks in exchange for financial gain. In late April, FCC boss Ajit Pai issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that aims to take the first steps to overturn the rules, a change that most ISP's support. FCC chairman Ajit Pai. Eric Gaillard/Reuters The FCC is scheduled to vote on the proposal at its next public meeting on May 18. If it is approved, as expected, a second vote will then be needed before any formal changes take effect. In between all of that, the FCC has opened a public comment period. This is a procedure in which the agency seeks feedback on how best to approach whatever it is considering. In this case, the feedback is for Pai's proposal, which is titled \"Restoring Internet Freedom.\" The comment period opened in late April, and will close in mid-August. As of this writing, however, more than 128,000 comments saying the exact same thing have been left on the docket for the proposal in just the past three days. They are all in favor of the rollback, and read as follows: There have been roughly 740,000 comments left regarding the proposal as of this writing, so, while the apparent spam doesn't not make up a majority, it does represent a significant chunk of the total. HBO The comments have been left in near-alphabetical order, and largely appear to be using genuine names and addresses in their filings. According to separate reports from ZDNet and The Verge earlier Wednesday, however, at least some of the individuals listed say they had not commented whatsoever. The FCC declined to comment on whether it was aware of the identical messages, and if it would take such messages into consideration when going about its official policies. The fact that the comments are identical isn't a sign of nefarious activity in and of itself, but the lack of a clear source for the message, the alphabetically-organized filings, the reported denials of those who are listed as commenters, and the sheer volume of comments listed in such a short time frame, raise questions about their legitimacy. This isn't the first time a wave of identical, pro-reversal comments have been left on the docket. The Daily Dot found thousands of copies of a similar message shortly after the public comment period opened. At least 2,000 copies of another message expressing similar sentiments are in there as of this writing, too. In each case, it's unclear who exactly is behind the apparent spam. Some commenters on Reddit have suggested the newest comments stem from a 2010 press release from a conservative lobbying group, but the wording there is different enough to make any link tenuous. This latest flood comes just days after HBO personality John Oliver urged his viewers to contact the FCC in support of the Obama-era rules, echoing a similar call from 2014 that many saw as boosting the public's awareness of net-neutrality the last time the topic was under debate. Getty/Chip Somodevilla As ZDNet notes, a Vice News report said that heaps of fake comments were left around that time as well, and suggested that anti-net neutrality lobbyist groups may have been behind the charge. It's worth noting that there are several thousand identical messages that support of the current rules, too. The majority of those stem from a template put together by liberal consumer advocacy groups, though. Oliver's segment is thought to have significantly increased the number of comments left on the site over the past few days. (One report said the total was around 30,000 as of Friday.) Earlier this week, however, the FCC said it was hit by multiple DDoS attacks around the same time as Oliver's HBO show, bringing down the comment page in the process. Pro-Title-II lobbyist groups and some Democratic senators have since called for more information on the exact details of those attacks. The sheer number of messages could make it more difficult for the FCC to sift through those who've left their genuine thoughts and potentially fake, computer-generated comments. Either way, don't expect Pai to make his decision based on which position is more popular with the public; as we've noted before, the FCC chief has already declared that he'll only take comments that he feels provide \"substantial evidence\" into consideration.",

    "title": "How a Nintendo superfan turned his Switch into the perfect Super Nintendo throwback",
    "content": "Nintendo's new video game console, the Switch, is a major hit. It's sold out in many stores, and demand doesn't appear to be slowing down. It's Nintendo's fastest-selling console in history. Left: Nintendo Switch in home console form. | Right: Nintendo Switch in portable form. Nintendo That's saying a lot considering how remarkably popular some of Nintendo's past consoles have been. From the original Nintendo Entertainment System to the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo has an impressive legacy of making hardware that people want to buy in droves. That level of enthusiasm just as often translates to rose-tinted nostalgia. Look no further than the explosive sales of the NES Classic Edition console this past holiday for evidence: The NES Classic Edition is a miniature, $60 game console that plays 30 classic NES games. It's no longer being made. Nintendo Nintendo smartly plays this nostalgia to its advantage, re-selling its games and hardware over and over in slightly re-packaged form. But Nintendo can't possibly keep up with fan demand for 30 years of nostalgia. And it's moments like this when fans take that nostalgia into their own hands. Behold, the Super Nintendo Switch: Quite the looker! Andreas Wallin The beautifully nostalgic Nintendo Switch above is a custom job, care of a man named Andreas Wallin. He painted both of his Switch console's controllers -- the so-called \"Joy-Con\" gamepads on either side of the Switch's tablet screen -- and swapped out the standard buttons for Super Nintendo-themed buttons. The four color Super Nintendo gamepad was made for the Japanese market (thus the \"Super Famicom\" name). Evan Amos/Wikimedia He posted his custom-modified Nintendo Switch to Reddit's Nintendo Switch forum yesterday, and was immediately flooded with positive responses. More than just excitement, people were curious about his creation: How'd he do it? How long did it take, and how could they do it themselves? So we got in touch with Wallin, who explained his work as complex but possible. \"The internet is a great resource for modding,\" Wallin said in an email. \"I've been following the Switch and the great mod/remix culture that it has started around it. So I followed a few articles and videos about what to do to pick the Joy-Cons apart.\" Indeed, there are even videos specifically made for how to replace the buttons on the Switch. Like this one: Of course, it's not quite that simple. Wallin took apart each of his Joy-Con gamepads so he could paint them (Tamiya AS-16 Light Grey [USAF]). He wasn't aiming for a perfect re-creation of the Super Nintendo's grey color scheme. \"The color is a tad lighter than the SNES base grey,\" he said. \"Grey enough to homage, but still light enough to seem more modern.\" Andreas Wallin But, even more impressive than the grey paint job is the SNES-themed, four-color button layout. For this, Wallin turned to another Nintendo handheld -- the 3DS -- which used such a button setup in a recent variation. \"I ordered a set of replacement buttons for the New 3DS off eBay,\" he told me. But there's an issue, of course -- \"the bases of the buttons are different,\" he said. In so many words, the 3DS buttons don't directly fit in the Nintendo Switch. \"You need to either mod the 3DS button bases, or sand the Joy-Con buttons down and substitute the bases by gluing the pieces together.\" Glorious! Andreas Wallis This complication would be enough to deter most fans, but Wallin persisted. And in his persistence, he found encouragement for other would-be modders. \"Once I had all the tools and materials, painting took most of the day on/off (since each light layer of paint needed some time to dry sufficiently),\" he said. \"The button mod I did in-between; it took less than an hour, and then I had the disassembly and assembly which didn't take too long either. I spent my Sunday doing the complete mod, and let the topcoat cure the night over.\" Interested in doing something similar? You'll need a handful of tools (a tri-point screwdriver, a fine-tipped Phillips head screwdriver, and a pair of angled tweezers at minimum) to start. But let's not kid ourselves: You'll also need free time, obedient patience, and a lot of drive. Wallin said it best: \"I'm pretty sure most people who are industrious enough to find the relevant tutorial videos online, and feel they are able to follow those videos, can do this!\" Good luck!",

    "title": "YouTube scores higher with older age groups than millennials",
    "content": "Google's recent claim that YouTube is the coolest brand in the eyes of teens and millennials looks shady in light of new survey data from BI Intelligence, which indicates that older age groups consistently perceive YouTube more positively than their younger peers do. This is important because, for all the attention that millennials receive, baby boomers are still an attractive target market. They're easily the wealthiest demographic in the US, representing about 50% of the country's net household wealth, and will continue to be so until at least 2030, per Deloitte. Numbering close to 75 million people, they're also the second-largest generation in the US, just slightly behind millennials, according to US Census Bureau estimates. For brands, the way this wealthy and populous demographic perceives YouTube can provide insight into how the platform can be better leveraged -- and who they should be targeting. Boomers are more inclined to believe that YouTube won't serve them deceptive videos, while millennials are less sure about avoiding such content on the site. This means brands can reach older age groups on YouTube with more confidence that their campaigns will be viewed as upright and honest, so they needn't worry as much about brand safety -- or the risk they'll be associated with content that detracts from their image. And considering baby boomers find YouTube ads less annoying than millennials do, these campaigns should be especially well received by this group. BI Intelligence Older age groups are also more willing to share content on YouTube than younger folks. This indicates that, on YouTube, brands are more likely to reach an older audience that's engaged and open to sharing content, creating an opening for uploaded videos to spread organically. There are countless examples of such successful commercials on YouTube -- including Volvo's \"Epic Split\" featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme, viewed more than 86 million times; Dove's \"Real Beauty Sketches,\" with nearly 68 million views; and the legendary Dollar Shave Club commercial, which introduced the brand to millions worldwide, and eventually led to the company's $1 billion sale to Unilever. BI Intelligence Although YouTube ranked dead last for consumer safety in BI Intelligence's Digital Trust survey, boomers haven't abandoned the video site. In fact, the affinity older age groups have for YouTube makes them far more likely than younger generations to actively participate and engage with content on the platform. By targeting this mature demographic on YouTube, companies may elicit more responses to their videos and campaigns, generating conversations around their brands.

    "title": "TV giants are lining up for a fight over a potential $10 TV bundle without sports",
    "content": "Maddie Meyer/Getty Images Big TV companies like Disney and Discovery are lining up for a fight over a sports-free online TV package that could cost a mere $8 to $20 a month. Last month, Bloomberg broke the news that several cable networks were trying to put together a sports-free package for under $20, cutting out high-cost channels like ESPN, which alone cost $6.10 in carriage fees per subscriber in 2016. And on Discovery's earnings Tuesday, CEO David Zaslav laid out a bit of the case for such a bundle. \"Skinny bundle in the US is a fiction,\" he said. \"The idea that you have a $40 offering filled with regional sports, sports and all these -- an incomplete package, really, and then you have to buy broadband on top of it, so the skinny bundle is $60 or $70. So it's really not a skinny bundle. It's a bundle. It's a bundle that may be attractive to a small group of people. But, in the end, I think the market will be rationalized.\" His central point was that there's room in the market for a sports-free package that costs $8 to $12 a month. The main problem here is that the parent companies of the major broadcast networks -- NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox -- have paid a lot for sports rights, so they want no part of a bundle that makes sports seem less vital. The cable networks they own are also out. So no FX, USA, or Fox News. That means the bundle will have to be constructed of companies like Discovery, Viacom, AMC, Turner (though it does have some sports rights), and Scripps. Those five put together could indeed make a pretty compelling cheap bundle at $20 or less. You could potentially get a spread of programming from CNN's news, to AMC's dramas, to Comedy Central or the Food Network. There would be holes, but at the right price people might be willing to overlook it. The notion of this type of package, however, rankles media executives whose companies rely on sports. On ESPN parent company Disney's earnings call Tuesday, CEO Bob Iger scoffed at the idea of such a bundle. Disney CEO Bob Iger. AP \"Someone was out there today talking about a $10 bundle that didn't include sports,\" Iger said. \"I don't know how many channels you could fit into a $10 bundle, but I would imagine there wouldn't be any channels that were particularly attractive. Maybe someone will go out with a very-low-cost set of channels that can't drive the kind of fees that [the more popular ones do] ... But I don't see how that's practical in terms of gaining much penetration.\" You should take that position with a big grain of salt. Disney has been very proud of how many of the new online TV bundles ESPN is on, and it sees the medium as a major way to grow in the future. In fact, on the same call, Iger listed them: \"Sling TV, Hulu, PlayStation Vue, DirecTV and YouTube TV.\" \"The substantial growth we're already seeing makes us bullish on the future of these nascent offerings,\" Iger continued. \"Right now, they are a small part of the pay TV universe, but we believe they'll be a much bigger part of the business going forward.\" Disney sees these bundles as a way to stave off the decline in subscribers that has plagued ESPN for years. ESPN is losing subscribers, and it certainly doesn't want to be left out of any new packages that enter the market. And its wrath could spell problems for distributors that might want to sell a no-sports bundle. Why? Some of the contracts cable and satellite providers have signed with heavyweights like Disney and Fox are loaded with fine print designed to stop new bundles like these. And in 2015, ESPN sued Verizon over a sports-free bundle, saying it violated distribution deals. So even if Iger is publicly poo-pooing the very idea that anyone would want a sports-free bundle, that doesn't mean ESPN won't come out swinging if someone tries to bring one to market.",

    "title": "PepsiCo has experimented with mealworm powder for its snacks and drinks",
    "content": "Flickr/dlee13PepsiCo -- the food company that makes snacks like Doritos, Cheetos, and Quaker Oats cereal -- is looking for alternative protein sources for its products. On the open innovation site NineSights, PepsiCo recently posted a request for \"new and novel protein sources for usage in their snacks and beverages.\" These non-traditional proteins could include plant-based protein, mycoprotein (a protein made from mushrooms), or insect protein. The request also mentioned that PepsiCo has already done extensive work with soy, moringa (a protein powder made from dried leaves), duckweed, cricket powder, pea protein, dairy, single cell protein, and mealworm powder (generally made from roasted and milled mealworms). PepsiCo declined to comment on any specific plans, but spokesperson Andrea Foote said the company's R&D team is working on the project, which is not tied to any one brand. Other food giants are also experimenting with novel types of proteins, often made from plants. In 2016, Campbell Soup Co. started selling a line of non-dairy, plant-based milk with 10 grams of pea protein per serving. Later that year, Tyson Foods, one of the world's largest meat producers, launched a venture capital fund worth $150 million that invests in startups developing meat alternatives. The VC arm of General Mills, 301 Inc., has also invested in the plant-based protein startups Beyond Meat and Kite Hill, which makes non-dairy cheeses, milks, and yogurts. PepsiCo's request may reflect a growing consumer shift away from non-traditional protein sources. US sales of foods with alternative proteins totaled $4.9 billion in 2016, according to the Plant-Based Foods Association. The research firm Markets and Markets predicts that the meat substitutes industry will be worth $5.96 billion by 2022. \"Consumers the world over have embraced a variety of high-protein foods, such as Greek-style yogurt and beef jerky style meat products,\" PepsiCo's request reads. \"Unfortunately, that increased level of protein in the product can negatively impact consumer perceptions by adversely impacting texture, taste, color, etc.\" Ideally, PepsiCo said it would like to find a high-protein source that has a pleasant taste. Additionally, the company said the protein should be non-GMO, have \"a good sustainability story,\" and have an \"easy to pronounce and common\" name that avoids \"chemical-sounding ingredients.\"",

The bone-white concept won't ever enter production, but it does send an interesting message about the futuristic vehicles. Mainly, that hydrogen fuel cells can work in SUVs, and automakers pursuing the nascent technology may want to seriously consider ditching sedans in favor of larger vehicles. Toyota and Honda are currently leading in the hydrogen space. Sales are still low, however, as the vehicles are only available in California, which has invested heavily in its hydrogen infrastructure. But the two automakers' hydrogen options, the Toyota Mirai and Honda Clarity, are both small sedans. At a time where SUV demand is continuing to boom, installing the futuristic powertrain in a stunning SUV could be the best way to draw interest as both companies look to introduce hydrogen vehicles in the Northeast.

    "title": "Finland's basic income experiment is already lowering stress levels -- and it's only 4 months old",
    "content": "Unsplash / Haley Phelps Four months after Finland's social-security institution Kela launched a two-year experiment in basic income, a system of wealth distribution in which people receive a salary just for being alive, some of the 2,000 recipients are already reporting lower levels of stress. The $600 they receive each month might not be much, but it's enough to put some people's anxiety at ease, Marjukka Turunen, head of Kela's legal benefits unit, told Kera News. \"There was this one woman who said: 'I was afraid every time the phone would ring, that unemployment services are calling to offer me a job,'\" Turunen recalled of a woman who needed to care for her parents, and so couldn't work. Basic income is foremost a solution to poverty. Advocates say the system gives poor people exactly what they lack: cash. It puts money in their pocket to fix a leaky roof, buy a car to get to work, or save up for emergency funds. It's not enough to live on, but it prevents people from slipping through the cracks. With that financial security comes additional benefits, says Scott Santens, a basic income advocate and writer. Santens has been receiving a basic income for the last couple years from the crowdfunding site Patreon. He says basic income redistributes power into the middle-class -- namely, to turn down unappealing jobs -- and promotes trust. Basic income \"says everyone should be given a minimum amount of trust, because the way we currently use pieces of paper to measure and distribute trust is fatally flawed without it,\" he says, offering the example of supermarkets being full of food while millions of hungry people can't access it. \"Everyone is worth enough trust to enable their basic survival.\" Finland's program is a modified version of basic income, since most advocates claim the system must be unconditional. Finns had to have been unemployed when they applied in 2016 to receive the benefits. However, if they happened to have found a job after applying or after the experiment started, they will continue to receive the $600 each month. Turunen emphasizes that Kela won't provide any formal data on the trial's effectiveness until 2018. The participants who speak to the press may not represent the entire pool of recipients, she told Basic Income Earth Network. \"The results must be very carefully analyzed according to the information we only get at the end of next year.\" Turunen has expressed high hopes for the trial. Experiments in Kenya and elsewhere have shown basic income can work on a small scale. As she told Business Insider in January, however, the long-term data still doesn't exist. \"Some people might stay on their couches, and some might go to work,\" she says. \"We don't know yet.\" If there are couch potatoes, they at least seem to be relaxed.",

    "title": "Microsoft is following in Amazon's footsteps with a new service to steal Oracle's customers",
    "content": "Oracle founder Larry EllisonJustin Sullivan/GettyIn October 2015, Amazon announced a database migration service, specifically designed to help big businesses move away from Oracle and into the Amazon Web Services cloud. The so-called Amazon Database Migration Service was a huge hit, with companies moving 1,000 databases over to AWS in week one. Fast forward to April 2017, and companies have moved 23,000 databases into AWS using the tool, albeit not all of them were moved from Oracle. At the time, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels said that lots of customers wanted to escape the \"nightmare\" of Oracle and companies like it. Now, Microsoft is getting in on the fun with its own database migration service, helping companies bring their Oracle databases, or their older-school Microsoft SQL Server databases, over to its own Microsoft Azure cloud platform. It's currently in early preview, with pricing to be determined. On the other side of the equation, Microsoft has enhanced its support for popular database software like MySQL and PostgreSQL, so the Azure cloud is better suited for their databases when they get there. Microsoft Azure, generally seen as the second-place player to Amazon's leading AWS, is a major focus for the tech titan. Essentially, Azure and services like it let customers rent fundamentally unlimited supercomputing power from Microsoft's own data center. Much of Microsoft's resources have been devoted to getting customers onto Azure, pitching them on the higher computing power it makes available to them, as well as the relative ease with which they can use it to scale up an application as demand rises. But migrating existing technology, like databases, can be tricky, hence these migration services. Meanwhile, Oracle hasn't taken these competitive moves lying down. Oracle founder Larry Ellison has taken Amazon to task, taking any and all opportunities to trash it as a second-rate cloud, even as it promotes its own Oracle Cloud as the premiere place to run databases. Now that Microsoft is getting more aggressive about stealing Oracle customers, maybe Azure will make Ellison's hit list, too. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

    "title": "Microsoft has a funky new mantra",
    "content": "Microsoft CEO Satya NadellaThomson ReutersWhen Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella first took the job in 2014, it wasn't long before he unveiled a new guiding mantra, encompassing his new vision for the company: \"mobile first, cloud first.\" That mantra was a big departure for Microsoft -- it had spent the last several decades pushing Windows above all else, while Windows market share languished and the Windows phone business failed to get any kind of significant traction. Nadella was declaring his intention to build applications that work across all platforms, not just Microsoft's. Now, at the Microsoft Build 2017 event this week in Seattle, Nadella unveiled a new \"worldview\" for the company, to reflect the latest developments in the tech industry. Now, at Microsoft, the watchword is \"intelligent cloud.\" \"It's no longer just mobile-first,\" says Nadella. \"The user experience itself is going to span all your devices.\" In plainer terms, Nadella says that \"intelligent cloud\" simply refers to Microsoft's drive to build artificial intelligence into all its apps and services. The goal is to make sure that whether you're on a PC, a mobile app, or using a smart voice assistant, all your data and information is with you. \"The platform shift is all about data,\" says Nadella. Behind the scenes, that means Microsoft will have a renewed focus on making data from sources like Office 365, LinkedIn, and the Cortana virtual assistant a big part of its overall product offerings. By the same token, Nadella says that Microsoft is working to give developers using its technology access to more AI and other key tech. It also means going beyond its considerable efforts in bringing Microsoft Office and other key apps to Apple iOS and Google's Android. With voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa or Microsoft's own Cortana on the rise, entirely new mediums like augmented reality starting to break through, and even the car dashboard becoming a computing platform unto itself, Microsoft is revising its goal beyond merely conquering the smartphone. Still, \"intelligent cloud\" doesn't quite have the same ring to it, or the same clarity, as \"mobile first, cloud first.\" It'll be interesting to see how this message resonates with the rest of the world.

    "title": "The eSports industry is nascent but growing steadily",
    "content": "BI Intelligence This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"Digital Media Briefing\" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Total time spent watching esports is steadily rising, according to IHS estimates reported on by The Financial Times. More than six billion hours were dedicated to watching professional gaming last year, up 19% since 2015. By 2021, IHS expects global esports viewing to surpass 9 billion hours. As engagement with this content increases, revenue models will surface and solidify. Along with advertising, major revenue generators that are beginning to form include rights sales and e-commerce. Esports is far from fulfilling its revenue potential. About $280 million was generated from esports advertising last year and IHS forecasts this will rise to $1 billion by 2021, but this will still be less than 1% of the more than $115 billion digital advertising market that eMarketer expects will exist then. The big thing holding esports back is audience fragmentation, as different sets of viewers tune in for a wide array of gaming competitions. But it's gaining legitimacy and becoming mainstream. One of the big focuses for esport league stakeholders to bring the industry to maturity is to monetize the industry by selling team and media rights to brands and broadcasters. Top advertisers in the space include endemic tech and gaming brands like Intel, AMD and Samsung, and lifestyle brands like Coca-Cola and Red Bull. Esports will also be a medal event in the 2022 Asia Games, which could pave a way for full Olympic status shortly thereafter. Years ago, eSports was a community of video gamers who would gather at conventions to play Counter Strike, Call of Duty, or League of Legends. These multiplayer video game competitions would determine League of Legends champions, the greatest shooters in Call of Duty, the cream of the crop of Street Fighter players, the elite Dota 2 competitors, and more. But today, media giants such as ESPN and Turner are broadcasting eSports tournaments and competitions. And in 2014, Amazon acquired Twitch, the live streaming video platform that has been and continues to be the leader in online gaming broadcasts. To put in perspective how big eSports is becoming, a Google search for \"lol\" does not produce \"laughing out loud\" as the top result. Instead, it points to League of Legends, one of the most popular competitive games in existence. The game has spawned a worldwide community called the League of Legends Championship Series, more commonly known as LCS or LOL eSports. Websites even exist for eSports live scores to let people track the competitions in real time if they are unable to watch. There are even fantasy eSports leagues similar to fantasy football. So it's understandable why traditional media companies would want to capitalize on this growing trend just before it floods into the mainstream. Approximately 300 million people worldwide tune in to eSports today, and that number is growing rapidly. By 2020, that number will be closer to 500 million. And financial institutions are starting to take notice. Goldman Sachs valued eSports at $500 million in 2016 and expects the market will grow at 22% annually compounded over the next three years into a more than $1 billion opportunity. Of course, as with any growing phenomenon, the question becomes: How do advertisers capitalize? This is especially tricky for eSports because of its audience, which is young, passionate, male-dominated, and digital-first. They live online and on social media, are avid ad-blockers, and don't watch traditional TV or respond to conventional advertising. So what will the future of eSports look like? How high can it climb? Could it reach the mainstream popularity of baseball or football? How will advertisers be able to reach an audience that does its best to shield itself from advertising? BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled an unparalleled report on the eSports ecosystem that dissects the growing market for competitive gaming. This comprehensive, industry-defining report contains more than 30 charts and figures that forecast audience growth, average revenue per user, and revenue growth. Companies and organizations mentioned in the report include: NFL, NBA, English Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, NHL, Paris Saint-Germain, Ligue 1, Ligue de Football, Twitch, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, ESPN, Electronic Arts, EA Sports, Valve, Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, ESL, Turtle Entertainment, Dreamhack, Modern Times Group, Turner Broadcasting, TBS Network, Vivendi, Canal Plus, Dailymotion, Disney, BAMTech, Intel, Coca Cola, Red Bull, HTC, Mikonet Here are some key takeaways from the report: In full, the report illuminates the business of eSports from four angles: Interested in getting the full report?

    "title": "The world's hottest startup factory is transforming the ACLU in powerful ways",
    "content": "Anthony Romero at TED. Marla Aufmuth/TED The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has long been a force in American politics, but it wasn't always the kind of organization that came up in everyday conversation. After President Trump was inaugurated and attempted to block citizens of multiple Muslim-majority nations from traveling to the US, that all changed. Since the election, the ACLU's membership has quadrupled, from 400,000 people to 1.6 million. Behind the scenes, that growing membership started to become a little too much for the ACLU's infrastructure to handle. And so, in an unexpected move, the 97 year-old organization turned to Y Combinator -- a famous Silicon Valley startup accelerator that has spawned well-known companies like Airbnb, Dropbox, and Reddit. According to ACLU executive director Anthony Romero, teaming up with Y Combinator is already changing the way the nonprofit operates. The idea to work together originally came from Sam Altman, the startup accelerator's president, when Romero and Altman met at a conference in December 2016. \"He approached me and said 'I want to help,'\" Romero told Business Insider at the 2017 TED conference. \"He committed money, wrote a check, and then he was asking me how it was going [at the ACLU]. I was telling him it was quite daunting to kind of redirect this huge battleship in the middle of a real war.\" Protesters and ACLU legal observer at Discovery Green Park during Super Bowl events in Houston, Texas. REUTERS/Trish Badger At that time, the ACLU's technology infrastructure was nearing the end of its life. Problems included slow data migration, email throttling -- it would take hours to send a single message to members in the email activism program -- and data analytics that just weren't robust enough. Even though membership hadn't yet swelled to its current numbers, Romero could sense he needed to make a change. \"I'd always believed our members gave us money to put to use for programs. Things like tech and databases seemed like overhead, and so I kind of gave that less priority and poured more money into the litigation and the advocacy work,\" Romero said. \"And then I came to regret it, because all of a sudden my membership is quadrupling and I've got many more people to galvanize, and I've got a clunker of a [membership] database that doesn't really allow me to engage people in real time.\" In early 2017, the ACLU officially joined Y Combinator. As one of a select number of nonprofits in the accelerator, it's taking a unique path through the startup school. Instead of an investment (which is what for-profit startups get), it's receiving a $200,000 donation from Y Combinator. And while most startups send employees to join Y Combinator on-site, the accelerator embedded its people at ACLU headquarters in New York City. It was a controversial move, since Trump advisor Peter Thiel is a part-time partner at Y Combinator. But in an email to The Verge, Romero said that Thiel doesn't have a role in the ACLU project. Already, Y Combinator has helped the nonprofit make some significant tech upgrades. Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator and co-chairman of OpenAI, attends the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, July 8, 2016 in Sun Valley, Idaho. Every July, some of the world's most wealthy and powerful businesspeople from the media, finance, technology and political spheres converge at the Sun Valley Resort for the exclusive weeklong conference. Drew Angerer/Getty \"We have fundamentally revamped the security of our systems, because we're very worried about hacking and the integrity of our membership file. In the era of cyberattacks, both domestic and foreign, I don't think we were as secure as we needed to be,\" Romero said. The Y Combinator team has also helped the ACLU migrate its data onto an upgraded Salesforce CRM platform, and to figure out a fix for the email throttling issue. As a result of the collaboration, the ACLU is planning a revamp of its whole IT department -- Y Combinator is helping the organization reconfigure staffing and identify potential new hires and consultants. \"They're helping us anticipate what it is we want to accomplish using technology as opposed to what problem we have to fix yesterday,\" Romero said.",

    "content": "Microsoft CEO Satya NadellaAPMicrosoft is expected to announce on Wednesday morning that Windows 10, the latest iteration of its flagship operating system, now runs on over 500 million monthly active devices. That's up from 400 million the last time we got an update in September 2016. Right before Windows 10 first launched in July 2015, Microsoft announced an ambitious goal for the new operating system: getting it installed on 1 billion devices -- meaning PCs, tablets, and phones -- by the end of its 2018 fiscal year. The endgame of the drive for a billion users is convincing iPhone and Android app developers that Windows 10 has enough users to be worth their time. Now, Microsoft is halfway to its goal. Still, Microsoft itself has moved the goalposts a little bit here. In July 2016, Microsoft said that getting to a billion active Windows 10 devices might take longer than originally anticipated, thanks to the near-total collapse of the Windows phone business. We also don't quite know Microsoft's definition of \"active user.\" And this new number might also be a sign that Windows 10 growth is slowing down, at least a little bit. Microsoft says that Windows 10 had the hottest start of any version of Windows ever, thanks in large part to a special offer that let Windows 7 and 8 users upgrade to the new operating system for free within the first calendar year of its release. AP By June 2016, Windows 10 had 350 million active users, which went up to 400 million by that September, about a 14% gain over the three months or so. Now, from September to May, it went from 400 million to this new 500 million figure, a rise of 25% over about seven months. That's a small, but significant, slowdown. To Microsoft's credit, it's making some savvy moves to grow Windows 10: New devices like the Surface Studio PC and Surface Book laptop are wooing away Apple superfans who feel jilted by the latest MacBooks, while the forthcoming Surface Laptop looks to attract students, too. And many businesses are expected to upgrade to Windows 10 within the year. So it's not doom-and-gloom for Microsoft or Windows 10. But it does, perhaps, show why Microsoft is getting so aggressive about getting Windows 10 into more spaces and new markets. Get the latest Microsoft stock price here.",

    "content": "A mockup of the kinds of ads Facebook is trying to block with this new change to the News Feed. Facebook Facebook is going after the \"spammy,\" trashy ads that litter the underbelly of the internet by demoting websites that show them in the News Feed, the company announced on Wednesday. Links that feature deceptive ads, more ads than actual content, and sexually suggestive ads will be punished as part of this change to the News Feed's algorithms. The announcement follows the social network's moves in recent months to block advertisements from websites that are deemed to be promoting fake news. \"We are really going after the worst of the worst,\" Facebook VP of ads Andrew Bosworth told Business Insider during a recent interview. \"The people who are going to be affected by this are not going to have defenders.\" To identify websites with offending ads, Facebook's algorithms reviewed hundreds of thousands of webpages and matched the worst offenders to similar links shared in the News Feed. Bosworth said that Facebook users had reported clicking on similar webpages as being an \"unsatisfying experience.\" \"The impact is really going to vary a lot by publisher,\" he said, noting that publishers with offending ads will see a decrease in traffic from Facebook, while publishers without offending ads should see an increase. He said the crackdown, which will roll out over the coming months, was mainly focused on financially demotivating spam networks that use Facebook to boost their traffic. \"This is an adversarial environment where spammers are going to try to game whatever we roll out,\" he said. For companies like millennial news publisher Mic, Facebook's move to block low-quality advertising is a sign that their stories will have a better chance of reaching more people. \"The idea is that quality news and fact-based reporting will be able to find audiences more quickly, and it will help to elevate what we're doing,\" Mic publisher Cory Haik told BI. She said that websites like Mic have been competing with spam-fueled publishers for attention in the News Feed. \"It makes it harder for users to understand what's real and what's valid journalism,\" she said.",

In one of the ads, the company bills it as \"a dream paradise for all mankind.\" Called Forest City, the $100 billion metropolis will be able to accommodate 700,000 people. That's about 20,000 more than the current population of Washington, DC -- and it will have a density greater than Manhattan. A new video taken by a drone offers a look at Forest City's construction, which began in early 2016: As you can see, a few apartment buildings and park spaces have already sprouted up, and some other towers are in progress. When Forest City is complete by 2040, it will have office buildings, parks, a transit network, hotels, restaurants, shops, schools, and 250,000 housing units. While the mega-development sounds promising, several experts worry it could becomea ghost city, failing to attract the residents it needs to become a thriving metropolis. Since the 1970s, Chinese developers have built some-500 ghost cities in China. Forest City is expected to be the largest overseas project by a Chinese developer. In April, nearly 60 home buyers , 70% of which are Chinese, cancelled their leases in Forest City, reportedly due to China's increasing efforts to curb money from leaving the country. As Business Insider previously reported, the supply of Forest City housing is outpacing demand. In 2016, Country Garden sold just 15,000 of the 250,000 Forest City residential units, totaling about $2.6 billion in sales, according to Yu Runze, the company's chief strategy officer. There aren't many people walking around in the above video, but then again, Forest City is largely still under construction.",

    "content": "Peter More, chief competition officer of EA, and Kevin Lin, COO of Twitch, at Business Insider IGNITION 2016. Business Insider The world of e-sports is massive and still growing, and advertisers are wondering how they can profit from this phenomenon. Kevin Lin, COO of Twitch, and Peter More, chief competition officer of EA, sat down with Business Insider's Steve Kovach at IGNITION 2016 to discuss the role advertisers play in e-sports. In addition to revenue sources like subscriptions, donations, sponsorships, event-based ticketing, merchandise, food and beverage, and in-game items, Lin said advertising is the main way e-sports are monetized. So why do advertisers want to get involved? For one thing, the viewership numbers are huge. \"Some of them hit tens of millions,\" Lin said. \"In concurrents, you'll see millions.\" Additionally, users spend two hours a day, on average, watching content. During competitions, the number grows to 8 to 10 hours. Another reason e-sports are intriguing to advertisers is the demographic they reach. According to Lin, 90% of the Twitch audience subscribes to Netflix or Hulu rather than traditional cable. \"Broadcasters are wondering how to reach this demographic,\" Moore said, so they want to be a part of e-sports. With millions of young people not seeing traditional advertisements, companies are recognizing the need to engage with younger audiences in other ways. But there is a challenge in this form of advertising. Because this audience is not used to traditional advertising, they are quick to recognize when something is not authentic. Moore mentioned that brands have to be careful when entering this space, and must be able to show they are truly interested in growing the field of e-sports rather than just selling a product. \"A lot of brands that are very interested in the space are building entire divisions that are hired from the community,\" Lin said. \"They can help craft a message and marketing plan that really resonates.\" When done correctly, massive success can be had. For example, Nissan launched a holiday campaign on Twitch. The Twitter impressions and chat messages involving the word \"Nissan\" were in the millions. Nissan did not expect this result, but because the campaign was authentic it succeeded. Companies have huge potential to reach a new audience by dipping into e-sports, and we will likely be seeing even more of this in the future. We're rolling out the speaker lineup over the coming months, and you won't want to miss it. Business Insider IGNITION 2017 will take place November 29-30 at the Time Warner Center in New York City.

    "title": "One of the biggest questions ahead of Snap's first earnings call is whether its CEO will show up",
    "content": "Snap CEO Evan Spiegel.AP/Jae C. HongSnapchat will deliver its first progress report as a public company on Wednesday, but it's a mystery whether the man investors want to hear from will show up. Evan Spiegel, the reclusive 26-year-old Snap CEO, is considered the product visionary who turned the disappearing-messages app into a global phenomenon. And with Snapchat facing intense competition from Facebook -- and its stock trading below the opening price of its initial public offering in March -- Spiegel is the man Wall Street is betting on to lead the company to victory. \"People invested based on Evan's product genius,\" said Eric Kim, a partner at Goodwater Capital, a firm that specializes in consumer-company analysis. Investors want to get a sense of who Spiegel is, what his demeanor is like, and what his vision for the product is. Spiegel is still a relatively unfamiliar figure in the eyes of investors. When Snapchat was a privately held startup, Spiegel didn't take the stage at flashy product launches, as many of his peers do, and he made relatively few public appearances. Compare that with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is currently on a tour of the US, regularly posting photos of his various stops on his profile page. Since Snap's IPO, Spiegel appears to have done only one interview, with the Los Angeles Times, despite backlash about remarks he supposedly made about India and Spain. Wednesday's earnings call will provide Spiegel a chance to lift the veil a bit on who he is and what he's thinking about Snap's future, especially amid Facebook coming at the company with guns blazing. The question is whether Spiegel will stick to his under-the-radar image or address investors head-on. Spiegel could skip the call altogether, leaving COO Imran Khan and CFO Drew Vollero, who run the business side of things, to handle the investors' inquisitions. Snap declined to comment on whether Spiegel would be on the call. While some high-profile CEOs like Amazon's Jeff Bezos have eschewed investor calls, many tech CEOs, including Zuckerberg, carry the mantle of explaining their business to the world. Yet nothing about Spiegel's history suggests he's willing to follow tradition for tradition's sake. The greatest example is how Snap conducted its IPO. Instead of offering traditional voting shares, Snapchat's parent company offered only nonvoting shares to the public on March 2. The nonvoting shares and Snap's corporate structure set it up so that Spiegel and his cofounder, Bobby Murphy, retained control of the company despite its public status. Now that Spiegel's brainchild is about to issue its first earnings report, Spiegel has a chance to share his vision for the product with the world and lay out how the company plans to fight back against Facebook's attempts to thwart its user growth. Snap, however, has already said it won't issue forward-looking guidance about its business. A Spiegel no-show on Wednesday would be \"disappointing,\" Kim said. He says he believes Spiegel has to be on the call because it's Snap's product under attack, not its financials or ad business. Goodwater Capital\"I think there's so many questions about the product,\" Kim said. \"The financials are straightforward: It's not a profitable company, but it's growing fast.\" Kim wants to know how Snap plans to address the moves Facebook has made to claw away Snap's user base. According to a recent Goodwater Capital survey, Facebook increased its share of the so-called Stories market when it cloned one of Snapchat's most popular features. Meanwhile, Snap's share had stayed flat. RBC's Mark Mahaney also found mixed results on Snapchat's traffic trends. He said in his report that Comscore data showed that total time spent in the app had declined, although its average number of monthly unique visitors increased in the first quarter. Investors bought into Snap's vision during the IPO roadshow, and Spiegel was there to present and answer questions. But the competition from Facebook means Spiegel needs to make an appearance to explain what happens next with the product, Kim said. On whether Spiegel could afford to not lead the call, Kim said, \"Maybe pre-Facebook Stories, yes, but post-Facebook Stories, no.\" He said that when Spiegel went public, \"Facebook didn't have this product feature that went after his core user base.\" While it's unclear how the stock would react to a Spiegel no-show, it shouldn't surprise investors. After all, they've already invested in the young CEO's vision for the product when they bought nonvoting shares of a company he mostly controls. Get the latest Snap stock price here.",

    "content": "Benjamin Zhang Over the past 15 years, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a company with more than a century's worth of heritage and brand equity, has completely reinvented itself under BMW ownership. This reinvention was not conducted in a way that abandons tradition -- because that would be foolish-- but rather by embracing it while injecting a heavy dose of modernity. In other words, rather than slapping the brand's badge on a run-of-the-mill luxury car, they decided to build honest-to-God Rolls-Royce motor cars with the latest chassis, engine, and infotainment technology money can buy. First, there was the flagship Phantom limo. Then came the \"entry-level\" Ghost sedan. That was followed by Wraith coupe. Now, with the arrival of the Dawn, it's safe to say the Rolls-Royce revolution is complete. Late last year, just before the winter chill bore down on the Northeastern part of the US, Rolls-Royce dropped off a brand new Dawn for Business Insider to check out at our top secret suburban New Jersey road test facility -- the nerve center of our vast vehicle evaluation operation. Otherwise known as my colleague Matt DeBord's drive way. Obviously, this was the perfect opportunity for a weekend drive through the wilds of New Jersey. The Rolls-Royce Dawn starts at a lofty $335,000. However, our option-laden test car clad in Midnight Sapphire and Blue Ice livery cost a whopping $402,675. Hollis Johnson contributed to this story.",

Snapchat has added several new features to its app, giving users new ways to create, edit, send, and watch Snaps, The Verge reports, including: Snap said in its S-1 that its growth will depend on its ability to innovate faster than its rivals. It's clear that one area Snap is focused on is developing Snapchat's creative tools -- to give its users more freedom to express themselves than in its rivals' apps. And the further Snapchat stays ahead of its rivals, the better it looks. Conversely, its rivals look like unimaginative runner-ups every time they copy Snap. Rapidly launching new and original products, therefore, has big brand benefits for Snapchat. This will be a key asset moving forward, particularly for retention and growing average revenue per user. TechCrunch has already found that Snapchat users are staying loyal to the app. These loyal users are unlikely to be tempted to switch or defect to other platforms that, in their eyes, look like hackneyed Snapchat copycats. Mobile-app makers and content creators are vying for consumer attention in a crowded and noisy market. Even if an app can stand out enough to prompt a consumer to download it from among a list of millions, it then faces the challenge of enticing him or her to use it enough times to recuperate development, maintenance, and marketing costs. To make matters worse, those marketing costs have hit record-high levels over the past year as discoverability has become more challenging. And while consumers are spending more time in apps, most of that time is spent in a few favorites. Consumers spend almost three-quarters of their total smartphone app time in just their three favorite apps, according to comScore. But it's not all doom and gloom: There are numerous tools at a publisher's disposal to engage and re-engage consumers, and there are new products and solutions coming to market that can help alleviate some of the issues around this app engagement crisis. Jessica Smith, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on app engagement that explores the current state of the app market, the issues around engaging consumers, and the tools at a publisher's disposal.

    "content": "Justine Ezarik, aka iJustine, is one of the most popular people on YouTube, and it took a lot of work to get there. We spoke with Justine to find out how long it takes her to make her videos and how she prepared for a career as a social media superstar. Follow Tech Insider: On Facebook Following is a transcript of the video: Hey, I'm Justine and I make YouTube videos and I also am pretty much everywhere online as iJustine. So when I first started, I really honestly was creating videos because I was showing people that I knew how to edit. So at that time, I was also freelance graphic design and freelance production. So I was doing so many other things besides YouTube. And I also did have several full-time jobs. Which I think is so important, because the equipment and everything is expensive, and to be able to get that, you sort of have to have the income on the side. So I feel like it took a really long time for me to sort of get to that point. And I probably quit my jobs a little bit too soon, but if I wouldn't have, then I wouldn't have been able to put all of my focus and energy sort of into YouTube. I feel like you just gotta sometimes just dive right in. So I think one of the hardest parts is standing out on YouTube, because so many people are doing it. But for me, you know, I've just created content that I would want to see. Most of the stuff that I did learn I am self-taught, but I did go to school for video production, graphic design, multimedia, 3D, programming. Now I end up using pretty much everything of that in my career. If there's something that is super topical, I will shoot the video in the morning, then I will edit for maybe 4 or 5 hours, then post the video. So it really can be an all-day process. But there are other videos that take much, much longer. Especially product reviews, where I can review the product one day, then keep testing, and then finally give my wrap-up of that said product in another video. So those can take 3 or 4 days to shoot. And then there's cooking videos. I try to shoot a few of those in one day, and then some of those take 15 to 20 hours to edit. So it really depends on the video. I think also another misconception too is people think that, you know, vloggers and people film 24/7. Really, we don't. Like, I just sort of film little key highlights and then sort of fill in the blanks. And a lot of times, which I have done more recently this past couple of years, is try to bank some content. So if there's a day or week that I'm traveling, I'll know that I have videos set, and I won't have to worry while I'm traveling, and filming, and editing. But it's hard, because it is a lot of scheduling, and a lot of processes that go into it. So I guess it took a long time sort of building my career. I think I'm still building it. And what's really fun about YouTube and things online, is I kind of create my own destiny. And it's not just me, it's other content creators too. And it takes, I think, a lot of time really to sort of build that and figure out the content that you want. So I mean, we're 11 years in now, so I still feel like, you know, you're always building to the next thing.",

Here's the video: OnLeaks is known as one of the more reliable sources for inside information on unreleased electronics from the Chinese factories where they're built. Hemmerstoffer posted a picture of an iPhone 7 case months before the phone launched last year. However, Hemmerstoffer is worried this render may not line up with the final iPhone because Apple has been testing several prototype designs, he said, according to Gear. \"I can't confirm this is 100% accurate,\" he tweeted. This video lines up with what we've heard about Apple's upcoming iPhone: Here's how Hemmerstoffer described his process in an interview with Business Insider last year: \"I spend about two to three hours a day on this activity. I browse a large number of sites, forums, and social media on which I discover daily more or less credible leaks. ... \"In a large majority of cases, people who share indiscretions do so without a second thought, as the aim is to engage a discussion within the community on a forum or social network. By the way, many of them hope obviously to get notorious. \"Also, workers who encounter difficulty with the production of spare parts or the assembly of devices look for help on more specialized and obscure forums.\" Earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook blamed iPhone rumors for a \"pause\" in sales. \"We're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases of iPhone, which we believe is due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones,\" Cook said.",

    "content": "DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman.Google DeepMindThe capitalist model embraced by countries around the world is failing to serve humanity in many areas. That was the message of DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman this week -- the highly educated entrepreneur who sold his artificial intelligence (AI) startup to Google for PS400 million in 2014. \"We believe today that in some sense, capitalism in many ways has delivered so much for us over the last couple of centuries,\" said Suleyman at a Google ZeitgeistMinds event in London on Tuesday. \"We've delivered so much progress. No other construct or idea has been able to distribute benefits so broadly and so rapidly. \"And yet in many areas, capitalism is currently failing us,\" he said. \"We actually need a new kind of set of incentives to tackle some of most pressing and urgent social problems and we need a new kind of tool, a new kind of intelligence, that is distributed, that is scaled, that is accessible, to try and make sense of some of the complexity that is overwhelming us.\" Drought in Syria.Khaled al-Hariri/Reuters Addressing the audience of global thinkers and leaders, Suleyman went on to say that humans are struggling to grapple with the complexity of the systems that we have created, adding that our current financial systems \"need to serve the interests of the many and not just the few\". Suleyman, the son of a Syrian-born taxi-driver father and English nurse, supported his argument by making a number of points. \"800 million people don't have access to clean water today and that's going to more than double over the next decade,\" said Suleyman. A lack of food is another big issue. Suleyman said 800 million people are malnourished \"yet almost a third of the food that we produce goes to waste each year.\" He added: \"It would take 3.1 planets worth of resources if all of us across the world were to consume at the rate we do in the UK. How is that sustainable? What does that say about the mechanisms and the incentives that we've created and evolved over the last thousands of years of our species?\" The issues of clean water and food availability are only going to intensify as a result of global warming, Suleyman said, adding that the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere is higher than ever. \"We have ticking time bombs that our current systems are struggling to address,\" he said. On wealth equality, Suleyman (who is a multimillionaire himself) said that he'd like to see capital spread more evenly around the world. \"The incomes of the top 1%, most of us [at the Google event], have risen 300% over the last 30 years, while the bottom 2/3 have seen their incomes stagnate or fall. How can we change that to ensure benefits are distributed as widely and as fairly as possible?\" Inside a Google data centre.Google Suleyman believes that AI, and more specifically the AI being created by DeepMind, can play a crucial role in making the world a better place for everyone. The company's most famous algorithm to date is AlphaGo -- an AI agent that taught itself how to play, and master, the Chinese board game Go. But DeepMind is now looking to apply similar algorithms to real world problems. Last July, Google announced that it has been using a DeepMind-built AI system to control certain parts of its power-hungry data centres over the last few months as it looks to make its vast server farms more environmentally friendly. This week, Suleyman said the DeepMind technology has now been deployed in all of Google's data centres, as he said it would be. DeepMind is now in talks with the National Grid in the UK about a potential partnership that could help the entire nation to reduce its carbon footprint. Elsewhere, DeepMind's AI is also being used to help medical experts in the NHS to diagnose patients and treat them accordingly. The company has developed an app called \"Streams\" which is able to detect AKI (acute kidney injury) and other conditions. It is also using its software to help clinicians spot head and neck cancer, and early signs of eye conditions that human eye care experts might miss. The company's work with the NHS gives DeepMind access to large amounts of patient data and the collaboration has been criticised for not being transparent enough, with the first deal (made with the Royal Free NHS Trust in North London) coming under the most criticism.

This is a big improvement for Instagram's mobile web users, who could previously only view, like, and search for content on the mobile web. Instagram could be hoping to tap into emerging markets such as Africa and India -- where mobile web usage is still widely used -- to maintain its recent stellar growth.

You can't remind someone that their child is sick. You can't remind someone their dad went to jail or their mom is in trouble or they just lost their job. It's not possible to remind anyone of that.\" She found herself in an awkward position: Everyone knew that her husband had died, and she knew that they knew it, and that they weren't saying anything because they didn't want to \"remind\" her. \"I just felt like there was this huge elephant following me everywhere,\" she said. \"It's not just death -- again, it's all of those examples I just shared. I think one of the lessons for me is that acknowledging pain is so powerful.\" And what's the right way to acknowledge it? \"Not sugar-coating it, not 'I know you're going to get through this' -- because sometimes you're not -- but 'I know you're scared and I know this is hard, and we're going to get through it together,'\" she said. \"The power of acknowledgement and the power of we. Not 'You're going to get through this.' 'We're going get through this.'\"",

    "title": "'I'm sure it will go viral': Kellyanne Conway clashes with CNN anchor over Trump's firing of Comey",
    "content": "CNN's Chris Cuomo grilled White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Wednesday. CNN CNN anchor Chris Cuomo grilled President Donald Trump's top counselor, Kellyanne Conway, on Wednesday over Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey. In an interview that lasted just under 20 minutes, Cuomo said the timing suggested Trump was concerned about Comey's investigation into the Trump campaign's potential ties to Russia. He also noted reports that Attorney General Jeff Sessions was involved in Comey's firing despite saying he would recuse himself from matters related to the investigation. \"It seems very, very connected,\" Cuomo said. Conway dismissed Cuomo's allegation, repeatedly saying Trump acted on the advice of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who she said was \"only on the job for 14 days.\" \"This idea that the FBI has one thing going on, and it's the Russia investigation, and the idea that this is somehow Jim Comey Attorney at Law, one person in charge of it -- it's irresponsible to not report to your viewers that many people are involved,\" Conway said. \"It's a huge place and there are many people involved in numerous investigations.\" Cuomo suggested Conway wanted the investigation to \"be a hoax,\" saying the White House's claim that the investigation would yield no results was misleading. \"What I want is the truth. That's all we should all want here,\" Cuomo said. \"And the idea that you should know the fruit of this investigation this many months in is naive and deceptive.\" Conway shot back: \"I'm sure it will go viral because you used the words 'naive' and 'deceptive.' People will think you were saying that about me, although you were talking about a state of mind, I'm sure. I know that's the new thing, to go viral.\" Cuomo continued to press Conway about the timing of Comey's firing, noting that Trump said in a Tuesday letter addressed to Comey that the FBI director had told him he was not under investigation. \"It is unethical, it is arguably illegal for that to have happened once, let alone three times, and a lot of people who know James Comey can't believe it would have ever happened,\" Cuomo said. \"How do you explain that?\" \"This whole thing is very simple -- you're trying to make it very complex,\" Conway said. This is a president who saw that the FBI director had lost the public confidence, the confidence of Republicans and Democrats. Pull up their tweets. Watch their interviews on CNN. They had big problems with Comey when it was expedient for them.\" Though Conway had been absent from CNN for over a month before Tuesday, her interview with Cuomo was her second on the network following Trump's decision to fire Comey. As the story enveloped cable news Tuesday evening, Conway and the White House's deputy press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, were dispatched on television to defend the White House's move.

    "content": "Snap chief strategy officer Imran Khan oversees the company's growing ad business.Reuters Last month, Snap found itself in the midst of a sudden controversy. Its 26-year-old CEO, Evan Spiegel, was alleged to have said that he didn't \"want to expand into poor countries like India,\" according to a former employee who is suing the company. Snap quickly denied that Spiegel ever made the comments, but the damage was already done. Snapchat's app ratings in the Google Play store took a nosedive, and \"BoycottSnapchat\" quickly became a trending topic on Twitter in India. Now that Snap is set to report its first quarterly earnings as a public company on Wednesday, investors are wondering if the company can grow its ad business and user base in the face of fierce rivals like Facebook. And they'll be looking to Snap for evidence that there's enough room for it to grow in highly developed, rich countries. While Facebook builds drones to beam internet access to sub-Saharan Africa, Snap executives have frequently touted their app's popularity in North America and Europe, where the vast majority of advertising dollars are spent. In Snap's initial prospectus filing from February, the company said that more than 60 million of its 158 million daily active users were in the US and Canada. That number is roughly a third of the 182 million daily active users Facebook has in the same region. And while Facebook commands nearly 2 billion monthly users, half of its $8 billion in revenue last quarter came from the US and Canada. If Snap can prove that it's able to make more money off fewer users, it could curb the comparisons to Facebook that plagued Twitter during its early days as a public company. To do that, Snap will need to show that it can grow its average revenue per user (ARPU) even if its overall user growth continues to slow. For the fourth quarter of 2016, Snap's global ARPU was $1.05 and $2.15 in North America. By comparison, Facebook's ARPU was $4.83 globally and $19.81 in North America during the same period. Snap's stock finished Tuesday's regular session at $23.32, just below its opening price of $24 when it made its Wall Street debut in February. The company is currently trading at roughly 6% of Facebook's $434 billion market value. Here are the expected numbers for Snap's Q1 earnings, based on analyst projections compiled by Bloomberg: Get the latest Snap stock price here.",

Tesla's French slate and Tuscan glass tile options, however, won't be made available until 2018. Tesla unveiled its solar roof product last October, a month before it acquired SolarCity in a deal worth $2.1 billion. At the time, Musk said Tesla was offering four different tile aesthetics to encourage customers to ditch clunky solar panels for a beautiful roof. \"First of all, I've never seen a solar roof that I would actually want ... they're weird,\" Musk said in November. \"Every one of them that I've seen is worse than a normal roof, without exception. So unless you're going to beat a roof on aesthetics, why bother?\" The company has partnered with Panasonic to produce the shingles' solar cells at its plant in Buffalo, New York. Musk said installations will begin in the US this year, but that deliveries and installations won't occur in the UK and Australia until next year. Wednesday's order rollout will mark the first time customers can get a glimpse at the expected cost of Tesla's solar roof, which Musk has said will be cheaper than a normal roof, even before factoring in the value of generating electricity.

    "content": "An unofficial render showing how the iPhone 8 might look, based on leaks.Benjamin Geskin for iDropNewsWe just got another sign that the release of the eagerly anticipated iPhone 8 might be delayed this year. Ming-Chi Kuo, a reliable analyst with sources in Apple's supply chain, says there's increasing potential for a \"worst case scenario\" that could see Apple's next flagship smartphone delayed by months, according to AppleInsider. 2017 is the tenth anniversary of the launch of the iPhone, and Apple has big things planned. Alongside the expected release of the iPhone 7s, Apple is believed to be bringing out a high-end \"iPhone 8\" that will have significant new features including an almost edge-to-edge screen with a fingerprint scanner built in, a new camera with augmented reality capabilities, and wireless charging. But it sounds like production issues might cause delays -- a deeply frustrating setback for Apple (and customers). The Cupertino, California, technology giant is notoriously secretive, almost never commenting on upcoming products before their official announcement. So don't expect it to confirm or deny any of this. An alleged dummy model of the iPhone 8.Benjamin Geskin/Twitter The iPhone 8 (or \"iPhone Edition\" or \"iPhone X,\" depending on rumours) is supposedly selling for more than a traditional iPhone -- upwards of $1,000. However, there have been whisperings for a while that problems with producing the phone and its more advanced components could cause headaches for the launch. Ming-Chi Kuo has previously said that \"production ramp-up of OLED iPhone could be delayed to as late as October-November compared to the usual ramp-up period of August-September, due to increased production difficulty.\" Per AppleInsider, he now thinks that \"worst case scenario\" is more likely. As a result, the iPhone 8 might still be announced in September at Apple's annual launch event alongside the iPhone 7s. But while the 7s will become available immediately, the 8 may not go on sale for months afterwards. And even once it does hit the shelves, it might still be hard to find. \"Severe supply shortages may persist for a while after the new models are launched, capping total shipments of new iPhones in 2H17F,\" the analyst said.",

At 29-years-old, JamJar Investments claims that Leviten is the youngest female VC partner in the UK, and possibly even Europe. In her role, the Oxford University graduate will work alongside the three Innocent Drinks founders -- Richard Reed, Jon Wright, and Adam Balon -- and look to back early stage tech companies across Europe that have the potential to go on to become billion dollar businesses. JamJar investments has invested in companies like food delivery service Deliveroo, personal doctor app Babylon Health, and sleep tracking app Sleepio since it was founded in 2012. \"Promoting Katie to partner alongside the three innocent founders transforms our three legged wonky stool into a strong, well designed and beautiful chair,\" said Reed in a statement.

The Interger Club/Flickr (CC) LONDON -- Just Eat's planned acquisition of rival Hungryhouse is facing an \"in-depth investigation\" by regulators over \"competition concerns\" and worries it could hurt restaurants. In December 2016, Just Eat announced its intent to acquire Hungryhouse for PS200 million. But on Tuesday, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced that the merger of the two food delivery firms is being investigated over fears that it could harm competition, following an \"initial investigation.\" Founded in 2001, Just Eat went public in 2014 and now operates in 13 markets with over 64,000 restaurants and 14 million customers worldwide, the company says. \"Following its initial investigation into the merger, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has found that the companies are close competitors because of the similarity of their service and their broad geographical coverage,\" the CMA said in a statement. It believes that newer businesses in the market like UberEats and Deliveroo aren't necessarily providing much \"direct competition,\" because \"these tend to target different types of restaurant (primarily dine-in restaurants without their own delivery services). These recent entrants also offer less extensive geographic coverage than Just Eat and Hungryhouse.\" In short, the CMA says, it is \"concerned that the loss of competition resulting from the Just Eat/Hungryhouse merger may result in worse terms for restaurants using either of the two companies.\" As such, the regulator will then refer the merger for an \"in-depth phase 2 investigation\" -- unless Just Eat can assuage concerns before May 17. In a statement, Just Eat said it was aware of the decision, and that it \"looks forward to cooperating with the CMA and is committed to demonstrating to the CMA that the market is, and will remain, competitive following completion of the proposed transaction. In the meantime, Just Eat will continue to operate its business as usual.\" A spokesperson for the firm declined to comment further.

    "title": "We found Apple's mysterious office in Berlin",
    "content": "Business Insider/Sam SheadApple's mysterious office in Berlin has been located by Business Insider. The discrete office is on the second floor of Markgrafenstrasse 34, which overlooks the famous Gendarmenmarkt square in the centre of Berlin. The office, which Apple has never publicly confirmed the existence of, was linked to the highly secretive Apple Car project last April and its location has been a mystery until now. There are no Apple logos to be seen but the company does have its name next to a tiny buzzer outside the building's main door. Apple did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. It wasn't easy and it's taken several months of asking around. Apple did not respond to us on several occasions and more than a dozen Berliners working in the city's tech industry said they had no idea that Apple had an office in the city when Business Insider asked them about it. Google Maps Eventually, a source in the Berlin startup scene told us that Apple has an office near Gendarmenmarkt -- arguably Berlin's most magnificent square -- but they declined to give us the exact address. They did, however, give us one more clue by saying it was close to Einstein Kaffee, which is a coffee shop on the corner of Gendarmenmarkt. When we visited Einstein Kaffee on Tuesday, a barrista told us that the Apple office was next door on the second floor. Apple's name and logo are missing from the second floor slot on the sign in the window but the company does have its name next to a little door buzzer that's easy to miss. Gendarmenmarkt square is home to the Konzerthaus (concert hall) and the French and German churches.Wikimedia Commons No sign of Apple on this sign.Business Insider/Sam Shead We asked a man leaving the building if Apple was indeed inside and he confirmed that the tech giant quietly moved in around a year ago. He said he wasn't sure how many people Apple had in the office because the elevators only take people to the floor that their key cards have access to. We then called Apple's camera-equipped buzzer three times but got no answer. As we stood outside, blinds were lowered over the windows of the Apple office, possibly to prevent us photographing any confidential company information that may have been visible on the walls inside. The Apple buzzer.Business Insider/Sam Shead It's all a bit of a mystery but it's possible to make some educated guesses based on previous reports. Last April, a report from German publication Frankfurter Allgemeine said \"Apple is running a secret laboratory for the development of an automobile -- and this in the middle of Berlin.\" At the time, the report said the laboratory was reportedly home to 15-20 staff with backgrounds in engineering, software, hardware, and sales. LinkedIn suggests that Apple has 168 people working in the \"Berlin area.\" Many of these employees work in the Apple Store in Kurfurstendam but LinkedIn shows that Apple has dozens of engineers working in Berlin as well. Mapping is one area where Apple seems to be focusing its engineering efforts in Berlin. The company has hired at least half a dozen employees from automotive mapping company Here -- owned by Audi, BMW, and Daimler -- for a Berlin-based Apple Maps team. A source, who wished to remain anonymous, told Business Insider last April that Apple strategically moved in on Here's talent as the mapping company was passed from Nokia to the German automotive group. \"It's a simple story: Here was in disarray after Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia,\" said the source, who works in the Berlin tech scene. \"Apple saw the opportunity and opened an office in Berlin, specifically to siphon Geo Information Systems (GIS) talent.\" The source said they did not know where the Apple office was when we asked them. A concept Apple Car.Motor TrendApple has never admitted that it is working on an electric car but the company has recruited dozens of automotive experts from companies like Ford and Mercedes-Benz, according to The Financial Times. Apple's self-driving car efforts are known internally as \"Project Titan.\" They have been the subject of rumours and speculation for years, and Apple's focus is now believed to be on building autonomous software rather than an entire vehicle. There may be hundreds of of people working on the project. At one point, former Ford engineer Steve Zadesky, who helped build the iPhone, and Johann Jungwirth, who was Mercedes Benz's R&D chief, were both working for Apple. Documents obtained by Business Insider earlier this month gave us a first look at this technology, which is \"capable of sending electronic commands for steering, accelerating, and decelerating and may carry out portions of the dynamic driving task.\" Human drivers remain in the vehicle when the self-driving mode is engaged, and can override it at any time. Apple CEO Tim Cook visited BMW's German headquarters in 2014, according to a Reuters report last January, which also stated that senior Apple executives went on a tour of BMW's Leipzig factory to learn how it manufactures the i3 electric car. Silicon Valley heavyweights like Google and Uber are carrying out their own research into autonomous cars, as are many of the traditional car manufacturers, including BMW, Daimler, and Volkswagen.",

    "content": "Angela Felix LinkedIn/Angela Felix Angela Felix loves her job. That may not seem unusual, unless you know what her job is. Felix is a tech support worker. IT support is like the Rodney Dangerfield of tech professions. It gets no respect and is widely considered one of the worst jobs in the industry, something entry level people do until they can move up the ranks as quickly as possible. There's good reason for that reputation. IT support people are the ones dealing with frustrated customers, who often yell at them during their calls. And the job is one of the lowest paying in tech too. On average, US tech support workers earn $36,000 a year, according to Glassdoor. But there's a flip side to the job, said Felix, who works for a major insurance company in Arizona, according to her LinkedIn profile. Tech support work offers the chance to help people, she wrote in a post that went viral on LinkedIn, which she gave Business Insider permission to share. \"I had someone recently make a jab at my job title, calling my Help Desk Lead role a 'little beetle bailey help desk job.' \"It bothered me and I found myself trying to justify why I'm almost 40 and not in a management or director-level role in IT after 13 years. This is why. \"I love what I do. Do I like resetting passwords for the same folks every day? No. But I do love the sound of relief after I have. I'm grateful I'm the first person people reach out to when they don't know what to do. I like knowing people feel they can count on me to get the job done right the first time. I'm blessed enough to be trusted by my company with access to just about any application we have, and I'm thankful my team respects me enough to hang on for the ride. So...so what I have a 'beetle bailey help desk job.' At least I find value in people and not titles.\" Felix's post has been liked by over 25,000 people and has received over 2,000 comments. Many have been gushing, like this one: \"You are an inspiration, Angela! It's clear you take pride in your work and that the people who contact you are treated kindly, professionally and competently. They are NOT just another number. It's also heartwarming to hear about how you have stayed in your position because you love what you do and you have not succumbed to the pressure to change jobs in order to 'move up the ladder' and land in a role that may not be as satisfying.\" Or this one: \"Helpdesk function is very critical for any IT organization to make any meaningful impact of the services they provide to business users.\" Or this one: \"You are the definition of success.\"",
