    "title": "5 Simple Tricks to Keep Your Accounting in Line",
    "content": "Accounting is not everyone's strong point, but as a founder, you're going to need to learn the necessary skills to keep your business running smoothly. We asked five entrepreneurs how they keep their finances organized for their company and personal life.I have accounts for my personal accounting and my business on Mint.com. It allows you to add all cash, credit, loans and investments and automatically itemizes and categorizes to easily download to Excel for additional analytics. You can add notes, filter, re-label, etc. It makes it easy to read, hand off to the accountant, and saves time when trying to figure out any financial questions.- Jessica Baker of Aligned SignsThough it can be tough, keeping a weekly schedule to review transactions helps you recall the reason for a purchase for quicker categorization, which makes your life easier towards year end and quarterly reviews. For business, I use QuickBooks online to track multiple checking and saving accounts. You can easily provide company executives and your accountant access to run reports.- O. Liam Wright of True InteractionThe best advice I can give anyone is to keep track of every single purchase you make with even a vague connection to your business. Also, keep your personal and business accounts separate wherever possible. I've seen too many entrepreneurs whose financials are a confusing mess simply because they buy dinner and groceries with their business account.- Steven Buchwald of Buchwald & AssociatesI have a separate credit card for my personal and business purchases. Online purchases usually let you choose payment options so I can pick the credit card that it should reflect. This allows me to avoid putting the wrong purchase in the wrong category.- Ajmal Salem of Suprex LearningWe have an accountant who checks our books, credit card purchases, checks, EFTs and automatic bill payments a few times a month. That way we always have a second set of eyes outside of the company looking over our numbers to make sure nothing is amiss.- Ben Walker of TransOutsourcingRead more tips on managing your daily duties at Tech.CoThis article is courtesy of BusinessCollective, featuring thought leadership content by ambitious young entrepreneurs, executives & small business owners.",

    "title": "How Star Wars' BB-8 Put This Robotics Company on the Map",
    "content": "In 2014 Sphero, a robotics company based in Boulder, Colorado, didn't realize that their efforts would be majorly boosted by a fictional robot from a galaxy far, far away. But one of their mentors was Disney CEO Bob Iger, which meant that their company came to mind when Bob needed to bring the robot BB-8 to life as a toy prior to the release of the biggest blockbuster of the 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. They produced the app-enabled BB-8 by Sphero, which sold out within 24 hours of hitting Amazon and retail shelves across the world.In honor of May the fourth, a.k.a. Star Wars day, I grabbed a quick conversation with Sphero cofounder Adam Wilson. Here's what he said on the impact of their Disney deal, and what the future holds.\"Our team created the App-Enabled BB-8 by Sphero which launched in September of 2015,\" Adam told me, \"and we followed that with the release of our Battle Worn BB-8 and Force Band.\"The partnership was transformational to our business on many levels. Working with Disney had a tremendous impact how our team developed products - they are the best at bringing characters to life on screen and our team can now infuse personality into robotics in the same light.Additionally, we now have a team of more than 170 with offices in Boulder, Colo., the UK and Hong Kong.\"Read how humanoid robots could pave the way to MarsSo does the robotics startup have plans for future Star Wars tie-in toys? Here's all Adam had to give me:\"While I cannot comment on specifics relating to what's coming next, I can tell you that Sphero is releasing five new products this year. You'll have to wait and see!\"Hey, as long as their new products are half as cute as a tiny, whistling, roly-poly android, they can't help but succeed.Love Star Wars? Us too.

    "title": "10 Funny Star Wars Day Tweets from a Galaxy Far, Far Away",
    "content": "A long, long time ago, in a galaxy that looks a lot like this one, someone realized that \"May the Fourth\" sounds like \"May the force (be with you)\" and alas, Star Wars Day was born. This yearly celebration of a sci-fi film franchise turned global phenomenon brings together nerds, jocks, geeks, and adults that don't categorize themselves anymore in awe of this widely accepted masterpiece.The celebration has become an even bigger event, as Disney as revived the franchise and is planning a Marvel-esque universe that will see Star Wars fans drooling for years to come. Plus, with Star Wars Day gaining more and more steam every year, who knows: we might end up with a national holiday in the future!As for the origin of this delightful turn of phrase, the pun can be dated back as far as 1979, when author Alan Arnold was chronicling the making of The Empire Strikes Back for Lucasfilm:\"Margaret Thatcher has won the election and become Britain's first woman prime minister. To celebrate their victory, her party took a half page of advertising space in the London Evening News. This message, referring to the day of victory, was 'May the Fourth Be With You, Maggie. Congratulations,' further proof of the extent to which Star Wars has influenced us all.\"In our own little celebration of Star Wars Day, we've searched through Twitter for some of the most enjoyable, adorable, and down right funny tweets for you.

    "title": "How Entrepreneurism is Making Space Tourism Viable",
    "content": "Many entrepreneurs have sought their fortunes through adventures of exploration. Mesopotamian entrepreneurs prospered by expanding their landlocked trade routes east to the Indus Valley (modern-day India) and west to Egypt. Several hundred years later, Phoenician entrepreneurs did so on the open seas, leveraging their superior nautical skill to establish profitable new trade relationships with previously unknown parts of the world.The same principle applies to the legions of successful Arab traders in the Middle Ages who made their fortunes from an extensive landlocked and maritime trade. In recent years, another unabashedly entrepreneurial project has been transforming entrepreneurial exploration: space.In 1994, the American Society of Civil Engineers convened with businesspeople in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to discuss the technical and financial feasibility of space tourism, then still a hypothetical concept. Although the technical hurdles were believed to be significant, the attendees concluded that none of them were insurmountable. What worried them more was where the money would come from for the research and development efforts that would be required to make space travel both comfortable and affordable.Since then, by funding those efforts that make ongoing improvements in rocketry and other technologies possible, entrepreneur's like Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk have helped fill a vacuum left by the wavering public sector commitment to space exploration. Certainly, the U.S. government's recent disengagement from its space program has yielded tremendous entrepreneurial opportunities for the pioneers of the space tourism industry.Just like the exploration of the \"New World\" hundreds of years ago, the current exploration and planned colonization of space is being spearheaded by entrepreneurs. In 2001, in conjunction with the Russian Space Agency, American entrepreneurs Peter Diamindis, Eric C. Anderson, and Mike McDowell charged a wealthy Californian $20 million for eight days of space orbit. The early 2000's was also when the likes of legendary serial entrepreneurs Musk, Branson, and Bezos founded their own space tourism companies.In 2000, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos established Blue Origin. Named after Alan B. Shepard, America's first astronaut, Blue Origin's spacecraft is known as the New Shepard. The vehicle has tested successfully but additional improvements are slated to follow along with an online spaceflight reservation system.Since its founding in 2002, Musk's SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies) has been at the forefront in the conceptualization and manufacture of efficient space rockets. In 2008, the company's first rocket, Falcon 1, reached orbit successfully and, since its founding, SpaceX has had ten successful flights of its space vehicles to the International Space Station and continues to make pioneering advances in rocketry.In 2004, the man behind Virgin Records and Virgin Atlantic (airline), Richard Branson, established Virgin Galactic to become \"The World's First Commercial Spaceline.\" Since then, he has completed development of Spaceport America in New Mexico and has made significant advances with his SpaceShip Two vehicles.\"I think I'd be very disappointed if we're not into space with a test flight by the end of the year,\" Branson told the UK's Daily Telegraph in April of 2017.The enormous progress made over the past decade and a half in space exploration owes a lot to the spirit and drive of entrepreneurs. This impact extends well beyond the realm of profit seeking and has proven to be crucial to the advancement of mankind. And it's no surprise that like thousands of years ago in Mesopotamia, entrepreneurs are once again are seeking success through adventures of exploration.Read more about space travel here on Tech.CoPhoto credit: NASA",

    "title": "How the LinkNYC Network Heralds the Rise of Smart Cities",
    "content": "Smart cities -- the term for modern-day cities powered by cutting-edge IoT tech -- are starting to emerge. Kansas City's recent award-winning \"smart city\" initiative gathers data from its downtown streetcar line in order to help businesses adjust their services to the flow of foot traffic in the area. One South Korean town has cut buildings' operating costs by 30 percent after installing smart sensors to better regulate water and energy use. NYC is leading the pack: Just this week, Brooklyn will even host a four-day Smart Cities NYC conference dedicated to the topic.Cites and smart tech are a natural fit, since the jam-packed populations of any major city offer the one thing any system-wide tech advancement needs: Raw data. Here's a look at how NYC is leading the way in creating a better connected, more efficient city than ever -- and a look at the impact that a smarter city can provide.LinkNYC Map at Link.NYCLinkNYC offers the best municipal service for the younger city dwellers: free WI-FI broadband from a series of city-wide kiosks that also offer USB charging ports, phone calls, maps, and a built-in tablet that anyone on the street can use to surf the web. Even the machines themselves are smart, according to the company, as they use \"internal sensors to understand the environmental impact on the structures.\" It's the phone booth for the 21st century.The service is provided by the CityBridge consortium in partnership with New York City. Over 800 LinkNYC kiosks are already in place, and 11 new machines in Woodhaven were just announced last month. LinkNYC's goal is to install 7,500 kiosks across the big apple by 2025.Read more about NYC startups hereThe smart city market, potentially worth trillions, operates using a vast system of data collection techniques: Its leading technologies are location-based, recognition-focused, transactional, or service-linked, and it's all integrated with daily city life. In short, smart cities represent the biggest shift in city life for the past century. But don't take my word for it: Listen to what Stephen Goldsmith, professor of government and director of the Innovations in Government Program at the Harvard Kennedy School, told the Wall Street Journal: \"In terms of city governance, we are at one of the most consequential periods in the last century.\"Thanks to the connective tissue of LinkNYC's internet-providing, phone-charging kiosks, New York City is growing smarter every day.Read more about the NYC ecosystem here at Tech.Co",

    "title": "Ocean Renewable Power Company Restructures, Raising $2.5M in Series B",
    "content": "Portland-based Ocean Renewable Power Company is in the midst of raising $2.5 million in its second big equity round of fundraising.The renewable energy company has raised $1.31 million out of a $2.5 million offering, according to paperwork recently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The round so far includes three investors, according to the paperwork.Besides putting new capital to work in the company, Chris Sauer, the company's CEO, told Maine Startups Insider that this Series B investment round has also allowed the management team to completely reorganize the company.\"It was really a three-part transaction that completely recapitalized and restructured the company,\" Sauer said. \"The whole idea is to set us up for future growth, which this certainly does.\"The first part of the transaction was to convert all the private debt carried by Ocean Renewable Power Company LLC into equity. They then converted the LLC into a C Corp, and brought new equity into the new corporation, now called Ocean Renewable Power Company Inc.\"So, the net effect is if you looked at our balance sheet before the transaction, we were heavily laden with debt and not a lot of equity,\" Sauer said. \"Now if you look at our balance sheet, it's quite the opposite. It really is setting us up for future growth\"This new equity round has so far brought three new investors into the company, including one major family office, Sauer said. The new capital is being used for general working capital purposes and will fund the company through the end of the year, he said.While the company has generated some revenue, Sauer said it was a negligible amount. This is the company's second big equity raise. In 2009, it raised $13.2 million in a round led by Caithness Energy, which has morphed into a private family office called Spindrift Equities.Counting debt, ORPC has raised nearly $50 million, Sauer said. When including federal and state grants, the total increases to more than $80 million. While the restructuring swept most of the debt off the company's books, it still owes a very small amount of debt to the Maine Technology Institute and Coastal Enterprises Inc., Sauer said.ORPC made headlines several years ago for becoming the first company in the world to generate electricity from the ocean's tides (in Cobscook Bay in 2002) and a river's current (Alaska in 2014) and deliver it effectively to a power grid. The past three or so years, though, the company has returned to the lab to make its technology more efficient and to reduce manufacturing costs, according to Sauer.So far, the time creating \"Version 2.0\" of its underwater electricity-generation technology has paid off, Sauer said. He said the company has reduced manufacturing costs by more than 50 percent and should be ready to deploy Version 2.0 of its TidGen system in Cobscook Bay in Washington County in 2019, and its RivGen system in the Kvichak River in Igiugig, Alaska, the same year. However, it still has a $16 million backlog of projects related to grants it's received for particular elements of its Version 2.0 technology.Communities like Igiugig are where the company's go-to-market strategy begins. It's remote communities like this where Sauer said the company can compete on price with the existing solution of diesel-powered microgrids. There are more than 700 million people around the world living in remote communities that rely on diesel.\"It's a dispersed market, but it's a big market,\" Sauer said. \"And it's a market where we can go to scale.\"As the company penetrates these markets and deploys more RivGen and TidGen systems -- depending on the interior or coastal location of the remote community -- its manufacturing costs will come down and eventually make it possible to target its second-tier market, which are countries that inherently have high electricity prices. Japan and Chile are two such countries, Sauer said.\"There are areas like that around the world where they have good tidal and river resources. Our pricing can't quite get there right now, but we will be able to compete within a few years,\" Sauer said.Ultimately, as Ocean Renewable Power Company scales and is manufacturing 1000s of its systems, Sauer expects ORPC will be able to reduce its costs to a point where it will be able to compete in the U.S. market.\"But that's still years away,\" he said.Read more about the Maine startup ecosystem here on Tech.CoThe post ORPC restructures, raising $2.5M in Series B appeared first on Maine Startups Insider.This article is courtesy of Maine Startups Insider, created by Whit Richardson, a journalist who's covered Maine's business community for the past decade.

    "title": "2017 Is the Year of the Social Influencer",
    "content": "Micro-influencer. Brand ambassador. Middle-influencer. Brand advocate. Catchy titles and buzzwords aside, these branding models are all driven by the currency of social capital and they continue to reach a growing audience.At Ideas That Evoke, we're declaring 2017 the year of the influencer. As a social agency, we always have a finger on the pulse of authentic content creation and have had to think beyond traditional media channels. Much of our success working with both small businesses and Fortune 500 companies has been due to a leverage in content from a base of social influencers.As savvy consumers, we can agree that audiences today do not connect with logos -- they connect with humans. Before selling a product, your brand is selling trust. Content from an influencer's non-branded advocacy base is authentic and relatable, allowing an audience to connect with a brand on an identifiable level. Consumers value that personal touch in their highly digitized day-to-day lives, but the inclusion of influencer marketing strategies returns more than just a feel-good connection; it delivers results.Audiences have shifted from TV, radio, and print media to YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram in droves. And with influencer marketing, brands can meet the consumers where they are. When the brand interacts and engages with a consumer on a social platform, they begin a conversation that transforms a purchase into an experience. These interactions elevate the brand connection and grow brand loyalty.The key to wrapping your mind around this concept is to consider the economy of attention. Attention is a valuable resource and a growing commodity in the modern market. Consumers selectively choose where they spend their attention, and brands are adjusting their marketing investments to the channels where consumers are measured to invest their attention.According to recent Nielsen data, influencer marketing is currently more effective than traditional advertising. Nielsen cited two contributing factors: true user engagement and the halo effect -- the endorsement of a product acting as a word-of-mouth endorsement of the brand.Influencers can also provide shareable, branded user-generated content (UGC). Influencer content and UGC are immune to ad-blocking software, which means they're reaching more of an audience than standard display ads.While brands are quickly catching on to the influencer market, influencers are responding in turn. That increase in demand for influencer channels has some increasing costs -- sometimes outweighing a brand's ROI. But like any other self-regulating marketplace, when inflation hits, differentiation creates sustainability.Brands have the option to work across the influencer market to meet audiences. Working with influencers requires developing relationships, and the scale of influencer marketing is broad enough to be compatible with any size business.Tapping into this growing market is possible using a scalable model. By identifying a branding model that suits the needs and culture of your company, you'll be able to integrate influencers into your marketing strategies across social channels. Here is a breakdown of common branding models:These are contractually bound experts, superstars or up-and-comers in your market. The brand ambassadors we work with are typically small groups of between 20 and 25 contractually bound professionals who have tens or hundreds of thousands of followers across their platforms.Ambassadors are a fantastic extension of your brand, as loyal experts who can test new products, attend your events and curate conversations that lead to raging fans and increased engagement with your organization or product.Think of your brand advocates as super fans who can't stop talking about your product. While they may not have the followings or professional reputation of your ambassadors, advocates are influencers who you must engage with on a semi-regular basis. They even occasionally send products to in an effort to re-energize their channels and brand loyalty.When talking about the influencer bullseye, this group is it. Micro-influencers have between 10,000 and 100,000 followers, making them the golden goose for content that maximizes engagement and impact, according to a recent study by the influencer marketing platform Markerly.The best part? Oftentimes, the only cost to working with micro-influencers is the cost of offering your product or service to trial.If you have the budget to spend on a high-impact influencer program, you'll be looking to \"power middle\" influencers to move the needle. These are folks with a large reach of up to 250,000 followers that have been carefully cultivated through relationships and two-way communication over a long period.In the eyes of consumers, there is weight to these relationships and, unlike celebrities, consumers see \"power middle\" influencers as relatable, which only increases their impact to drive decision-making and consumer psychology.A version of this post originally appeared here.

    "title": "4 Ways to Save Money with All-In-One Tools for Startups",
    "content": "Running out of cash is one of the top reasons why startups fail. That's why the formula to success isn't always about profits. To get your company ready for the long haul, you must also implement strategies that will minimize the costs of operations.Nowadays, entrepreneurs are getting creative with how they save money on ventures, like going green, allowing remote work, and selling through social media. For online businesses, it's all about using the most cost-efficient and flexible platforms that will help you do more with your money. Below are four simple strategies you should consider:Generating leads is one of the toughest challenges for online startups. For this, businesses need to pay attention to several key components such as landing pages, lead channel optimization, and nurturing strategies.GetResponse is one of the few email marketing tools that has turned into a complete lead generation platform. It can help you create landing pages, manage your email lists, design newsletters, automate marketing content, and a lot more. You can also take advantage of the analytics dashboard to track and optimize their strategy over time.Despite its features and ease of use, you can use GetResponse for way cheaper than using separate tools for email marketing, landing page design, and analytics. That is, until you exceed a thousand subscribers or wish to spice up your lead generation with webinars - then, you'll have to upgrade to the pro plan.Plenty of startups choose to operate remotely to reduce overhead costs. However, ensuring the productivity of your team while working remotely is a big challenge. To bring your team closer together as well as delegate tasks more effectively, you can use an online communication platform like Slack.The main selling point of Slack is that it provides an online startup with a single virtual workspace. You can track conversations, check the progress of ongoing tasks, share files, send private messages, and have live video conversations. The tool also comes with a mobile app so you can stay ahead of conversations no matter where you go.Finally, the base features of Slack can be used for free with no expirations - perfect if you want a no-risk strategy of upgrading your online business from emails and phone calls.Building, hosting, and maintaining a website costs money. A professional web designer, for example, may cost you thousands of dollars if you chose to build a custom website from scratch. With iPage, you can do everything associated with your online presence - from domain registration all the way to web page design.Since the web design aspect of iPage depends on the WordPress infrastructure, you can easily install themes, create pages, and handle other tasks involved in running a website. The platform is also powerful enough to help you build an online store complete with PayPal and shopping cart integrations.Whether you need to track business expenses, send invoices to clients, or do your accounting, you can always count on Freshbooks to make things a breeze. It is a cloud accounting software equipped with built-in project management features - from time tracking to file sharing. Regardless of the platform's depth, it offers a simplified interface that anyone can learn in minutes.Another reason to use Freshbooks is that it integrates with cloud business platforms like Shopify, Stripe, and the G Suite. This allows you to consolidate every aspect of running your online business in a single location.Read more about startup tips here on Tech.Co",

    "title": "Albuquerque Accelerator Takes Aim at Health and Wellness",
    "content": "An accelerator supports startups by providing education, mentorship, and financing when needed. In its three-year history, ABQID was just the kind of accelerator that Albuquerque needed. A venture-backed accelerator focused on startups with high growth potential and any kind of outlook.For example, Innobright, a company creating fast and easy rendering processes for animators, was one of the startups in their first cohort in 2014. Since graduating from the cohort, they've since been through several rounds of growth and recently won the Steve Case Rise of the Rest in Albuquerque.Now ABQID has taken on a new CEO and a new challenge. This year, ABQID announced TJ Cook as the CEO of the organization. Prior to taking on ABQID, TJ was CEO of CauseLabs for four years.\"We were kind of an every person's web firm,\" said Cook. \"CauseLabs was the company's internal program for people who wanted to make the world a better place. I decided it shouldn't be an incubator, it should be the company.\"Causelabs has since grown to work with large corporations like Lego and nonprofits like the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. After taking a look at ABQID, Cook and the board decided it too needed a different outlook. After asking their startups to find a focus, ABQID has decided to find theirs.\"It's tough for any organization or startup when your market is potentially large,\" said Cook. \"But we all know that it's worth it to focus on the market that is most ripe for your product and go after them.\"That's why their first cohort of this year will be focused on a theme - health and wellness. The decision was based on the potential market in Albuquerque, the fact that Albuquerque has two world class national labs, the positive lifestyle that one can obtain in Albuquerque, the innovative research from the University of New Mexico's Health Sciences Center, and the impressive programs that the Central New Mexico Community College offer for training and equipping the health and wellness pathways.By focusing, ABQID hopes to better serve their cohort and create a better process. They're also looking forward to other themes that they can incorporate in the future.If you have a Health & Wellness startup, make sure to apply by June 13.Read more about accelerators supporting startups here on Tech.Co",

    "title": "Your Email Could Be the Welcome Mat to Hackers [Infographic]",
    "content": "Some of the biggest security breaches involved emails and with more companies keeping data in the cloud, your email could be the doormat to your company's secrets if you don't sharpen your security skills. Here are five things you need to be diligent about to protect your data in the cloud, starting with your email and then check out the timeline of the most famous email breaches.This is an obvious one but there is no point in investing so much money for guaranteeing a quality service if you neglect the first essential step for building up a strong network: the server's password.As a key point, all passwords should, at least, include three of the following elements and changed once every 180 days or less: uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, dots or dashes and special characters (!@@#$).Since malicious software is the primary suspect when it comes to data loss in servers and computers overall, it is important to take all the necessary measures to keep such intromissions at bay. Something as common as plugging a USB into our laptop or downloading an attachment from an email can lead to disastrous consequences, thus the importance of having a reliable anti-malware protection for our system. In general, you can trust the services of security giants like AVG, Avast and Kaspersky but don't simply rely on your basic operating system's defense system to do it all.One common error that is mixing business and personal life in our email account. Why do I make emphasis at this point? Simple: You could be using the very same mail account you happen to use for business for all your social media networks.This scenario is a huge mistake as malware's first route for accessing your data is precisely through social media networks: friend requests from unknown people, viruses sent through Facebook Messenger services and so on. Spam also has an essential role and  not every link sent to your mailbox should be opened - hence the importance of taking preventive measures against email security breaches.If your aim is to reduce your company's liabilities, then avoid using the same account you use for your personal emails for setting up your cloud-based server. In the long term, you will be thankful for taking such route.Read more on protecting your company's data against threatsThe best way known to date to secure your information is to restrict access via encryption. How does this work? You can use the services of Cloud Protection Apps to generate passwords and key sequences for the files to be uploaded. That way, content can only be accessed through your account or your personal password.On this behalf, cloud storage services like Mega have introduced such protection means by encrypting all data to be shared, and the reason why you can't get your content back in case you lose your password: accounts only have one chance of setting a password, and once access is lost, no one can access the data stored on the server.Another common practice applied for many fields and that can be easily introduced for Cloud storage is the restriction of access through a hierarchy. Since the nature of cloud storage allows people to log from anywhere to access your data, enforce the security of your files by requesting unique login credentials for accessing the content in question.You can easily do this by setting different passwords for the content to be stored according to the sensibility of the data in question in regards to your company. Data that should be shared among working peers has to be stored with one password, whereas sensitive data whose leak could potentially damage your company has to be protected with another password. A master access password (or admin password if you like this term) also needs to be set for managing everything that's going on with your data. To avoid a potential password mess, you can just create an interface that requires a login from users to access the data, setting different privileges for the accounts in question according to the user's role in your company.Here is a timeline of some famous email security breaches in this infographic courtesy of Avatier.Read more on protecting your company from cyberthreats here at Tech.Co",

    "title": "How to Summit Mount Everest From Your Couch",
    "content": "While I fully appreciate the challenges and threats of avalanches, blizzards, and a lack of oxygen, I've only seen them from behind a computer screen. I'm not about to summit Mount Everest myself, but a new format has emerged that will let me see the sights from every angle -- all 360 degrees of them.Sports Illustrated is getting into the VR game with a new film documenting the ascent of Mount Everest. It's a stunning adventure that marks a new genre for VR film: The roller-coaster-like ride of taking a trip to a remote location of the world without leaving the comfort -- and safety -- of your own home.While other VR films have depicted the climb -- one offers a \"God-mode\" view of the Himalayas after your journey is complete -- this is the first to capture the event in live-action as it happened.Time Inc.'s Sports Illustrated and LIFE VR, in partnership with Endemol Shine Beyond USA, premiere Capturing Everest, the first-ever complete ascent of the world's tallest mountain in virtual reality. The film covers a 2016 climb by Brent Bishop, Lisa Thompson, and Jeff Glasbrenner. Glasbrenner is an amputee, and Thompson a cancer survivor, lending the project pathos beyond simply beautiful 360-degree shots of the snowy peak. The footage was first available as a four-episode series on the LIFE VR app, and was shot mostly by the climbers themselves.This trip in particular was a great fit for a VR experience, since it's a visceral adventure that many want to experience, but few actually do, and even fewer live to tell about. This film is a particularly \"honest\" take, as Mia Tramz, the managing editor of LIFE VR, told Fast Company:\"Virtual reality, Tramz argued, is about putting viewers in the middle of an experience and helping them \"feel that moment and how rough it actually is. If it had [felt] polished and produced, it would have felt inauthentic. I'm very proud of how honest the summit [experience the film offers] is.\"Watch NASA launch a rocket into space in 360 degree videoYou can witness the epic climb via Viveport and Steam for the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Samsung Gear VR through the LIFE VR App. From the countless tiny yellow campsites to the stomach-churning suspension bridges to the foggy white mountainside itself you'll feel as though you are claiming right along with everyone.And you can follow the tale in print by checking out SI's cover story on Jeff Glasbrenner: He lost his leg in 1980, and has since become a wheelchair basketball world champion and an Ironman in addition to successfully topping Mount Everest. Now, thanks to the power of VR, you can see through his eyes as he does so.Read more about virtual reality at Tech.CoImage: Wikimedia",

    "title": "Facebook Admits AI Can't Do Everything Yet and Hires 3,000 Editors",
    "content": "Facebook has responded to a string of high-profile deaths filmed live or uploaded to Facebook afterwards: They'll be hiring 3,000 people solely to comb through video content and remove anything deemed too disturbing or violent. Here's the relevant quote from Mark Zuckerberg himself:\"Over the next year, we'll be adding 3,000 people to our community operations team around the world -- on top of the 4,500 we have today -- to review the millions of reports we get every week, and improve the process for doing it quickly.These reviewers will also help us get better at removing things we don't allow on Facebook like hate speech and child exploitation. And we'll keep working with local community groups and law enforcement who are in the best position to help someone if they need it -- either because they're about to harm themselves, or because they're in danger from someone else.\"So what does this move mean for Facebook's grand scheme? Here's a list of takeaways.Read more about maintaining your brand's reputation hereRemember Facebook's \"Trending News\" controversy last year? Back then, they got in trouble for displaying news blurbs as if they were automatically generated, but quietly using human editors. Then, they switched to an algorithm, ran several fake news stories in Trending, and got in trouble for that. Facebook just can't win. And as with their Trending News problems, Facebook's actions in hiring 3,000 editors indicates that they realize their algorithms just can't handle all their problems.Facebook wants to be a platform, not a publisher; a tech company, not a media company. Note that Zuckerberg makes a point not to call the new hires \"editors,\" just people on the \"community operations team.\" While Zuck finally admitted that they're a media company as late as last December, this news is further proof that they can escape neither the title nor the responsibility that comes with being a news source. After all, one in ten people think they're an official news outlet.As Slate senior tech writer Will Oremus wrote:\"I asked Facebook whether the new jobs would be employees or contractors, whether they'd be in the United States or overseas, and what the pay and benefits might be. The company replied that it had no details to add at this time.\"A Buzzfeed reporter tweeted additional information:Facebook says it's hiring 3,000 people to thwart violence. Won't say if they're contractors. No sign of those open roles on its jobs page. pic.twitter.com/CC8s6nTQnn-- Alex Kantrowitz (@Kantrowitz) May 3, 2017Given the difficulty and the strong demand for content editors, Facebook would be wise to offer good benefits and high pay as they'll need editors with a keen eye for what content shouldn't be distributed to the social media giant's over 1.86 billion active users.Read more about attracting talent to your company at Tech.Co ",

    "title": "Spelling Errors in Social Media Posts Could Cost You Your Dream Job",
    "content": "In a few short years, social media has gone from a pleasant addition to our everyday lives to an integral part of the social landscape. At this point in the game, people that don't have a Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn account are looked at with suspicion rather than pity. Any startup that knows what it's doing has multiple accounts, as well as a notable online presence. However, when it comes to landing your dream job, it could be these very accounts that spell your doom.According to data from YouGov, there are a number of posts that could easily prevent you from getting that second interview. After surveying more than 2000 business decision makers, YouGov was able to discover which kinds of posts are the most likely to raise concerns among potential employers. And the results are a little more petty than you might expect.Aggressive and offensive language came in as the number one reason an employee wouldn't be considered for a position, with 75 percent of decision makers saying that would put them off a candidate, with references to drug use coming in at number two (71 percent). Those are to be expected, as hundreds of blog posts and social media warriors have shown that they will stop at nothing to prevent an offensive troll from landing their dream job.However, the third most common reason employers are put off from candidates is bad spelling and grammar. More than half of these decision makers believe that the improper use of \"their\" warrants more consideration than someone posting drunk pictures of themselves. So before deleting that album of pictures from your trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, make sure to run a quick spell check on your next post.Wondering which sites you need to scrub before your next interview? Don't worry, YouGov has got you covered, as they also polled decision makers concerning which sites they are most frequently perusing to get this kind of intel. According to the data, LinkedIn and Facebook are the most commonly checked platforms, both at just under half of employers, followed by Twitter (28 percent) and Instagram (15 percent).If you don't feel like doing away with inflammatory posts, references to drug use, and poorly spelling, you could get lucky, as 31 percent of decision makers said that they do not check social media platforms of candidates. Fingers crossed!While some many think that the social media check-up is an urban myth, don't be fooled. According to the survey, nearly one fifth of decision makers has turned turn a candidate after checking their social media accounts. While startups and smaller companies do so less frequently, large corporations have the manpower to do a thorough check before hiring a new employee. So if you've got an interview at Google, you better start scrubbing now.Read more about social media behaviors here on Tech.Co",

    "title": "What More Payment Processing Options Mean for Ecommerce Startups",
    "content": "I see many of the changes in the ecommerce industry impacting what businesses will have to consider when they add or manage their payment processing systems. This is especially the case for startup founders like myself.The information presented below is based on findings from the customers who use our payment processing platform, and is focused on insights and trends in the type of online payments being used. Many of our customers also deal with offline payment issues that illustrate just how integrated these environments have become.Customers have noted their struggle to figure out what to adopt as some of their patrons prefer the contactless method, using digital wallet tools to complete sales without having to pull out a physical credit or debit card, while others like to use physical cards and are looking for the security that EMV chip readers provide them. Some digital wallets are now starting to support online payments as well, making it more of a struggle to select one over the other in terms of payment acceptance equipment.Some financial institutions are developing EMV chip debit cards that have contactless payment capabilities, which means there is no need for swiping a payment card, bringing together the best of both technologies. With more people accepting these new payment technologies, it's important to assess how you can add these methods to your own business, including enhancing your marketing effort through your own branded mobile wallet feature, loyalty and reward program, or membership format. A wide range of payment processing companies, including my own, offer solutions so you can add an EMV machine to your physical store or add software to accept contactless payments.With more people preferring to conduct their transactions through their mobile devices, including paying for their invoices and completing ecommerce purchases, businesses have to ensure that they optimize for the mobile screen. That means simplifying the navigation process for those looking to make their payments and creating an easy-to-read design that is mobile-responsive.Don't make it so your customer has to pinch and expand the image on the screen just to read what they are paying for and how to complete the transaction or have certain information fall of the page. You also don't want to scare them by sending them from your website to a separate payment website, as this will discourage them from finishing the process. Instead, make it as easy as possible so that filled shopping carts are not abandoned and invoice aren't left to collect virtual dust.While you may already be aware that the sharing economy is taking center stage in 2017 and beyond, it's important to align your payment process with this trend.People are used to sharing services and goods to make life more convenient and get more bang for their buck. And, with most people also used to making some type of digital payment, the expectation that payments can be split up many different ways means you'll have to think about adding peer-to-peer (P2P) payment acceptance where many people pay for that one service or item. The P2P payment system has functionality that lets customers designate who will pay for what part of a bill.Previously, you may have had to key in different card numbers when a party wanted to split the tab two or three ways. Now, you'll be able to receive a payment just with a phone number or email address, allowing various customers to pay you directly instead of having to split it up amongst themselves. Right now, it hasn't yet been adopted as a real business payments option, but as this example shows, it could easily head that direction.More clients we work with are telling us that they must work across channels because their ecommerce customers like the ability to use any online and offline channel when the mood strikes them. This is tied to the growth in the on-demand trend: Consumers may want to buy online and pick up an item or use their mobile devices while shopping in a store to pay for an item they see there so they don't have to stand in line.To solve this dilemma, payment solutions providers are working with other developers on the concept of a unique ID for each customer in order to synchronize all touch and pay points for a single platform. This will make it easier to accomplish the on-demand trend while ensuring that, as a business, you can maintain a consistent payment, inventory and service experience. A complete solution for this approach has yet to be developed, especially since there is a debate around ownership of the data now is being used across channels and how is it protected.While you may have a great business concept and you know there is a target audience for it, compliance and regulatory issues have pegged you as a high-risk business, making it seemingly difficult to tap into the type of payment acceptance options you need to realize the revenue potential.The good news is that there is an ecommerce trend toward identifying the new business segments and models that can drive future growth in the payments industry, so new solutions are being developed to help all types of businesses - from startups with founders that have no established credit to new platforms like crowdfunding and marketplaces to international customers.Read more about ecommerce here on Tech.CoThis article is courtesy of BusinessCollective, featuring thought leadership content by ambitious young entrepreneurs, executives & small business owners.",

    "title": "8 Ways to Make Your Infographic Pop",
    "content": "If you're a marketer, educator, business owner or blogger, you will likely already know that infographics are one of the top performing types of visual content out there. But coming up with an original topic for this type of content isn't easy.The problem is, there are just so many infographics out there already. For your infographic to stand out from the rest, it needs to be memorable. People need a good reason to read it and, hopefully, share it on their networks.A memorable infographic will entertain your audience, offer them new or unique information, and will hopefully even spur them to seek out more information about the main topic.So how do you achieve those things when virtually every infographic topic, it seems, have been covered already? Sometimes it simply involves looking at a topic from a new perspective or an angle that challenges popular opinions. You can also look for a specific niche within a community that has not been represented in many (or any) infographics.While your infographic may not cover a completely new topic, you can still provide new and unique values to readers paired with an engaging and memorable design that can stand out from the droves of other visual content.

    "title": "5 Must-Have Tech Devices to Boost Your Day-to-Day Activities",
    "content": "Whatever you do has to have a purpose; a meaning as why we're doing it. In today's world, productivity and efficiency are two concepts which seemingly everyone must exhibit. However, in order to truly reach a point of maximum productivity, you'll need all the help you can possibly get. Your human efforts can only get you so far. That is the place of technology.In recent times, there have been a plethora of technological innovations which have been aimed at helping people maximize their day to day activities and enhancing their productivity. Here's a look at five of our best.Music has a special way of increasing performance and activities. Studies give credence to the fact that people performs a tad better when listening to some of their favorite tracks and songs. Although this fact doesn't hold true for everyone, a majority of people (for example, me) will comfortably attest to that fact.Music players, apart from helping you perform optimally, are also awesome devices for when you feel stressed out or fatigued. Music is always an awesome way to relax and gather yourself.Today, there are numerous platforms and service that let you download your favorite tracks. While some are just useless and filled with ads, others give you real-time, easy access to multiple tracks, both old and new, from your favorite musician or group. All you need is to find the perfect music downloader where you can get your songs and your music player will always be at the ready to play them.Smartwatches combine portability with efficiency. These little guys can handle tasks just like your mobile phone, except for a few major tasks. Smartwatches are awesome for travelling and given the fact that they have long lasting batteries, you'll be able to use them for extended time periods.When choosing a smartwatch, you should be careful and put a few things into account. One of the major factors to consider is compatibility. In truth, not all smartwatches will be compatible with your mobile phone. Some are built for Android devices and Windows-operated phones while some are solely made for phones running on Apple's iOS. This is why before you purchase a smartwatch, you should perform a compatibility test and make sure that it's working fine with your phone.If you perform jobs which are physically demanding, you'll definitely need these ones. These devices track some specific aspects of your health in order to make sure that you're at optimal health at all times. Whenever an anomaly is recorded, the tracker will alert you so that you can quickly find a solution to your issue before it escalates into something more harmful to your health.Apps are programs which serve specific functions on you mobile phone, tablet or computer. Basically, without apps, your phone will just be a useless piece of metal. Whatever you do, there are certain apps which help you. However, there are also some apps whose functionalities cut across all fields, like Evernote and Slack.With Evernote, all you need to do is sign up and begin writing. You can easily write down all you're feeling or anything that just pops into your head. With its extended features, you can add voice notes and even external files -- pictures, PDFs or more.Slack, although it operates in a manner like Evernote, has some advanced uses. You can save entire webpages into your Slack page to read later and even communicate effectively with those around you; family, team members, etc. Slack has synchronicity with social media channels such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, thereby increasing your range of communication and accessibility.Ever had a long day where all you feel like doing on getting home is to jump in your bed, sleep and not worry about anything else? Well, with home assistants, you can actually do just that. Home assistants like the Google Home or Amazon Echo have connectivity features to some of the devices in your home, thereby making them able to handle specific tasks such as setting your alarm, turning on your microwave, etc. Working at home has never been easier.",

    "title": "How Life as An Immigrant Helped Me Launch a Startup",
    "content": "Being an entrepreneur is scary, exciting, and gratifying. Entrepreneurship elicits so many emotions mixed into one. The same is true about being an immigrant.Momchil Kyurkchiev, originally from Bulgaria, is the CEO and cofounder of Leanplum, a marketing cloud built for the mobile era, with offices in San Francisco, New York, London, and Bulgaria. They've raised $46M in funding from top-tier VCs like Canaan Partners, Kleiner Perkins, and Shasta Ventures, and won VentureBeat's GrowthBeat Innovation Showdown. Momchil has used his life experiences to help prepare for startup life. Momchil shares how being an immigrant has helped him launch a startup.It was 2003 and I had just arrived in the US from my native country, Bulgaria, ready for my freshman year at The College of Brockport in upstate New York. With only two suitcases containing the contents of my entire life, clothes, and my memories, I had everything I needed for a start fresh.Nine years later, as a founder, I was again back to nothing and constantly reminded that 90 percent of startups fail. Layered on top of this stress, my Google employee safety net had vanished. With the odds stacked against me, and terrified that the life I had built in America could evaporate in an instant, I knew I had to make my startup work.My scholarship covered tuition -- but the rest was up to me. To attend university, I borrowed the complete savings of my parents, including their 401ks, and took gifts from extended family. I scraped together enough to cover room and board for my first year, roughly $5,000.Raising funding is a similar experience. You have to rely on friends, family, and fools to get enough seed funding for your first product or service launch. It's a skill set that may feel awkward, but is essential to survive.Shortly after starting school, I landed a job as the \"smoothie guy\" in the school cafeteria. It was the graveyard shift, from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., earning 50 cents per hour more than the day shift.I worked 20 hours each week, the maximum allowed to work on campus as a full-time student, all while triple majoring in math, computer science, and computational science. I had time only for working, studying, eating, and sleeping.Between university and founding Leanplum (Techstars Seattle '12), I worked at Google for five years. When I left, I knew I was giving up the security of a work visa and paycheck, both of which I'd come to heavily rely on. In a way, it felt like I was a 19-year-old immigrant again, beginning from scratch with no resources. And when I started Leanplum, I was right back at it, coding, talking to customers, eating and sleeping.As busy as I was at university, I was also the happiest I'd ever been. Why? I felt empowered to pursue my dreams with nothing but my vision -- a belief I would need nearly a decade later as an entrepreneur. The thing about entrepreneurs who are also immigrants is we're relentlessly resourceful -- the number one entrepreneurial characteristic.In Bulgaria, there's a folklore character named Hitar Petar, or Clever Peter, akin to Robin Hood. Clever Peter relies on his resourcefulness to succeed, and there are plenty of stories that showcase his wit. His essence lives on in Bulgaria, a nation that may not be the most affluent, but one that is certainly resourceful. It's this trait that has helped me flourish, both in school and in Silicon Valley.Once you jump off that cliff, you can't look back. As a student, I was thousands of miles from my family, and terrified of failure. At the end of my four years, I worked hard and graduated Summa Cum Laude. But standing there with my two suitcases that day, I didn't know that's how my time at university would play out.Five years after launching Leanplum, I'm proud to have built a company that is every bit as successful as I could have hoped. We raised our Series C funding last October, continue to triple our revenue and employee growth each year, and work with the biggest brands in the world, like Tinder, Macy's and Lyft.It was my experience as an immigrant that made this all possible -- an experience that I wouldn't trade for the world.Read more about pursuing your dreams at Tech.Co.This article is courtesy of Techstars, the best global ecosystem for entrepreneurs to bring new technologies to market.

    "title": "Facebook's Creepy New Algorithm Knows How You Feel, Literally",
    "content": "At this point in the social media game, you've likely noticed the creepiness of digital ads on sites like Facebook and Twitter. Every time you talk about a particular topic in the privacy of your own home, a shockingly appropriate product advertisement shows up on the side of your feed. You didn't email, message, or even text the conversation to anyone, so what gives? Facebook's algorithm is what gives, and it just got a whole lot creepier.Sure, wedding registries showing up after an engagement announcement are fine, and Chicago Cubs ticket deals in your feed after Opening Day are more than understandable. But apparently, Facebook's newest algorithm update takes your emotional state into consideration when deciding which advertisements to display on your profile, according to a document obtained by The Australian.Despite the inherent creepiness, marketers and experts alike are convinced that this form of advertising is good for business. Yes, they're cataloguing and analyzing your emotions, but at least that reminds marketers and advertisers that you're a human being, right?\"It humanizes the consumer and it brings to the forefront behaviors and attitudes,\" says Alanna Gombert, general manager of trade group Interactive Advertising Bureau's tech lab. \"In some ways, it's the right thing to do. It equates to a person and not a targeting item.\"This is a question as old as technology itself: at what point does all this automation become too creepy? Even Tom Hanks' new film The Circle blurs the line between the necessity for innovative tech to make life easier and the freedom required of being a human being. The convenience of ads geared towards your emotions are undeniable, as purchasing likelihood is greatly effected by your mood. But do you really want all your bad days and stressed out evenings logged into a Facebook server?It's hard to argue with the fact that this level of data tracking is inherently unsettling. However, at this point, it's relatively moot. Smartphones are already recording your every move, voice assistants are listening to your every word, and laptop cameras are watching your every private dance session. What's one more platform tracking your emotions really going to do to your peace of mind in the long run? Tragically, if there's a straw that's going to break the proverbial camel's back when it comes to online privacy, this isn't going to be it.Read more about social media trends here on Tech.Co",

    "content": "Connections are key to creating a meaningful message. Anyone that has glanced at Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell will know that connectors help spur ideas and messages across a group.For founders, an entrepreneurial ecosystem is no different. Founders may have a great idea, but need help to transform that idea into a startup and ultimately a sustainable business. It is imperative for the people with talent, ideas and motivation to create something and find mentors that nurture their passion which lead to collaborative efforts that drive innovation that creates a fully functioning entrepreneurial community.If connections are the blood flowing through the body of an entrepreneurial ecosystem, then how does a developing body get into shape? We start by celebrating!Connecticut innovators continue  to develop our ecosystem by creating the inaugural CT Entrepreneur Awards and celebrate the entrepreneurs and support system that make Connecticut work. The inaugural awards will recognize a variety of individuals and organizations that connect, collaborate, and communicate amongst each other to help entrepreneurs succeed.Celebrations offer ecosystems an opportunity to engage all of the players that make a difference. Ecosystems are more than the top startups, they include mentors that offer guidance, the corporate institutions that engage with founders and the organizations that offer unending support.Awards provide an opportunity to meet the connectors that go under-the-radar and spur collaboration as players from different corners have a natural event to meet and discuss their dreams.Entrepreneur/startup award events are an easy way to stop and showcase the ongoing efforts of entrepreneurs in your community and spotlight organizations that help nurture their innovation. It's important to continue to recognize and highlight little wins and provide a path to inspire future foundersHowever, awards are not the only path to finding connectors.Another example of building connections is the KC Connector Project by the Kauffman Foundation that aims to recognize, support and connect the various participants in the KC ecosystem.The KC Connector Project does a few things for the ecosystem:Connectors in any community matter because they help connect the dots. In the words of the late Steve Jobs:\"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.\"Entrepreneurial communities are filled with connectors from different backgrounds and experiences who just can help connect the dots between talent and knowledge or funding. It's important for these connectors to stay active in the community and link mentors to founders as the result could be game changing.Read more about networking here at Tech.Co.",

    "title": "How Your Brand Can Succeed Through Trust, Transparency, and Exceptional Experiences",
    "content": "America has become more polarized than ever, and technology is at the forefront of both problem and solution. Between fake news deceiving viewers, non-transparent monopolies keeping consumers in the dark, and political bubbles making progress impossible, it's easy to become distracted or even confused about who or what is trustworthy.In the past week, your Facebook feed has likely been inundated with people listing a number of bands and one being a lie. The week before everyone was talking about the Mother of All Bombs or the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast. And the week before that the world was tearing into Sean Spicer for claiming Hitler never used chemical weapons.In the same period of time, Bill O'Reilly was kicked off the air, Silicon Valley darling Juicero was found to be an expensive paperweight, and we can't forget the countless photos of Starbucks' Unicorn Frappuccino. Add all that to the millions of cute animal photos and pictures of food your mom keeps posting to her wall. So how in this age can a brand cut through all of this noise?The battle for your attention has only just begun, and it's through trust, transparency, and exceptional experiences that a brand will succeed. This is according to the Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff and Casper Mattress Cofounder and CEO Philip Krim, both who spoke at DIG SOUTH Icon, a conference series that celebrates startups, tech, and innovation in the Southeast.\"Brand is what signals trust,\" said Bankoff. \"It's how you can trust something that you click on. Brands that don't provide that trust will be weeded out by the platforms and consumer base. So, we have to take control.\"In the early days of digital media, consumers and publishers treated online content in a very similar manner to print. The printed content would simply be placed online, occasionally there would be a few extra photos, and readers would have plenty of options to choose from. Now, there are practically endless choices to consuming content, which has in turn further empowered Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms to incidentally become aggregates of both news and noise.\"If you post on Facebook, you get a feel for what your friends are sharing or liking. In our case, we believe in quality content, quality journalism. In our case that's going deeper than a lot of what's on Facebook,\" said Bankoff. \"There is a lot of superficial content on Facebook. In fact, the Facebook algorithm is tuned to favor that kind of content. It's changing, there is a blowback on fake news, and people are concerned more about the world. Facebook itself is adapting to that. Facebook is starting to adapt.\"In order to get consumers to buy something online, a brand needs to establish trust. This can be done through having a secure site, product reviews, and eventually a track record for having quality goods. For consumer brands, the process is relatively straight forward; however, for media companies it's a constant challenge even when simply reporting facts. As far as news organizations go, Vox Media is still quite young, yet they have carved out their niche in the way they tell stories, not by gaming the system.\"Google used to be used for content discovery. Folks learned to game the system to get better visibility,\" said Bankoff. Call it black hat SEO or a if you can't beat them join them mentality, Google's algorithms are now fine tuned to focus on surfacing higher quality content. \"Demand Media for example, they just pumped out a lot of content. Then Google woke up and changed the algorithm to favor quality media brands. As a new comer, Vox started to benefit. Yes, we needed to be smart to show up in google results, but what is more important is what's on the other end. You need quality if you want to be sustainable and successful over the long hall.\"Though a constant necessary struggle, trust and transparency is but a foundation for retaining readers or consumers.\"It requires a bit of faith to say we are living in a state of change. Things are not ideal right now. Through all this disruption new solutions are found,\" said Bankoff.In a separate keynote fireside chat at DIG SOUTH Icon, Casper Mattress Cofounder and CEO Philip Krim discussed how their user experience, transparency, and instances of surprise and delight have led them to rapid success. To start, prior to the wave of jack in the box style beds, they had to go to a store, speak to a commissioned salesperson, and then awkwardly lay on each bed.\"They would try to convince you to spend hundreds or thousands more than you need,\" said Krim. \"The first step we had was to circumvent the traditional experience, traditional retail. That's why we built casper.com, the industry is very tightly control. Two organizations manage most of the manufacturing, and they work hand-in-hand to keep consumers in the dark.\"In response to an outdated approach and being able to cut out a few middlemen, Casper was on a mission to build transparency in the industry with a customer-focused mentality. When they first hit the market, the team started to receive positive press coverage about what they were doing and how they were innovating in the space.\"We thought we'd sell one or two, and convinced some people to write about us,\" said Krim. \"We started selling one or two dozen, then it became terror when we said how are we going to fulfill all those orders. Then it became 100 orders. The supply chain was the biggest pain. It was all word of mouth at first, especially because of the exp and delivery (small mini fridge sized box). It was such a better experience than anything out there that people started talking about it. It's an amazing part of our business.\"Although Casper was not the first mattress company to sell these kinds of mattresses, it's the entirety of their experience that has people still talking. According to Krim, they were the first to really brand the experience.\"We added hand-written notes, etc. We were surprised by how many people filmed the experience online. It's sort of like the foam dino that you add water and it expands. People are having so much fun with it.\"A quick look at both Instagram and Twitter confirms this sentiment, with customers showing off everything from the Casper dog beds to them unboxing their own bed. The other component for the brand is that while they started entirely online and with ecommerce, the team embraces physical retail as well.\"We are at the convergence of offline and online,\" said Krim. Between mobile popups and showing their beds off in various partnered stores it allows consumers to still follow the traditional model if they wish. For their standard approach, Casper will send you a bed for up to 100 days, and if you don't like it, they will ship it back free and then donate it to a local charity or upcycle it to a showroom (after being cleaned).\"We always focus on surprise and delight, because we know how important this product is to people. The science of how it leads to creativity and productivity etc...It's why every detail really mattered to us,\" said Krim.Read more about how your brand can succeed here at Tech.Co.",

    "title": "Top 10 Cities for Jobseekers in the US",
    "content": "Jobseekers are subjected to a bevy of unfortunate circumstances. From awkward interviews and long drives to disappointing phone calls and devastating emails, searching for a job is soul-crushing enough to make even the most confident person question their value in the business world. If you're having trouble finding a job, it's important to remember the old adage made popular by the real estate industry: location, location, location.According to data from Indeed, the popular website for jobseekers, looking for a job is a lot easier in some cities than others. For your viewing pleasure, they've compiled a list of the best cities for jobseekers so that you can hone your search more geographically, giving you the edge of your competition when it comes to knowing what you're fighting for.While jobseekers come in all shapes and sizes, Indeed narrowed the criteria down to four simple questions based on job market favorability, salary, work-life balance, and job security and advancement. As for the results, sunshine apparently has a notable effect on the job market of US cities.That's right, Florida boasts three of the top ten cities for jobseekers, proving that the innovation of the coastal tech hubs does not translate into a fruitful job market. Miami, Orlando, and Jacksonville all posted high job security and market favorability numbers, despite lacking noticeably in the salary department.\"The Sun Belt continues to be a region of high-growth and opportunity as companies and workers alike have moved toward strong job markets,\" said Paul D'Arcy, senior vice president at Indeed.The rest of the top ten is filled with sunshine-riddled cities, like Austin, San Jose, and Memphis, showing that a little bit of warm weather can go a long way for a burgeoning job market. Plus, with no tech hubs on the list, innovation appears to be more of a hinderance to jobseekers than anything else.Read more about finding a job here on Tech.Co",

    "title": "5 Tips For A Successful Mobile App Launch",
    "content": "There are over 2 million apps available in Apple's App Store and nearly 3 million in Google Play. New companies trying to launch an app today have a lot of competition. Getting attention for your app nowadays is no easy feat, and the organization and planning to have a successful app launch can be more strenuous and lengthy than people might guess.If you don't adequately prepare your company for your mobile app launch, you won't get the traction, public interest, and revenue that you're hoping for. Like any business action, a mobile app launch needs a keen marketing strategy, a demographic whose needs you're trying to satisfy, and something innovative that you're bringing to the table.  Here are five tips for a successful mobile app launch:The first thing you need to figure out for your app is who it will be geared towards, that is, who your marketing demographic will be. What problem will you claim to solve, and who is having that problem? Knowing who you will market an app towards can help you decide on what sets of features your app should come with, what design and aesthetic you will aim for to make it visually appealing your customers, and what the app will be for.A financial app that helps you monitor the progress of your investments, for example, will be geared towards older customers, who may also be slightly less phone-savvy. In this case, you'd want to make the functions intuitive for older folks used to paper records, as well as sufficiently helpful as an independent app that your more tech-savvy customers find it helpful in accomplishing tasks that would be relevant to their day-to-day life.The early steps of app development should include market research. Figure out what currently exists on the market today in your related field. Are other companies offering similar services? Is there a glaring hole in the marketplace for a service you can provide? Are there particular complaints that show up in customer reviews across the field you might be able to take care of?You should use this research to help figure out what you can develop that will set you apart. According to Inc. Magazine, you will not find success with an app that only incrementally improves a feature others have. You must bring something significantly new to the table, or your already-established competitors will easily be able to one-up you and overshadow you with their size. Find something unique and make that your selling point.Before you launch your app, you should have a customer beta period that will give app users an opportunity to describe what the user experience actually looks like. During the development process for your app, you should seek out beta testers that can review your app as you construct it, giving you chances to improve along the way. This will reduce the amount of post-launch updating and bug fixing that you would have to do without ample in-development beta testing.In addition, you should conduct beta-testing once development is completed but before the launch to cast any last-minute errors or bugs.This is the era of social media, which means your app launch has to focus on and include social media in its marketing plans. Do this by constructing ads that play off popular social media icons. Even if you're designing a GPS app or an app-based game, you can use the icons to market, making posts that encourage users to repost, retweet or otherwise share to reach a wider audience, and get your app mentioned in the news and on blogs.Social media is really just representative of what people are talking about - which means if it's on social media, it is what people are talking about.Once your app is launched, you need to make sure you have a robust customer service department and bug reporting programs that can give your customers the chance to quickly report issues, and give your team the chance to resolve them quickly. Customers who feel ignored will quickly take to social media to complain as quickly as they went to social media to learn about or talk about your app, which means it is now more important than ever to respond to social media and to give your customers private outlets to easily get in touch about their issues.Mobile apps are ubiquitous, which means you have to be responsive, innovative and smart to make a successful app in today's marketplace. Adequate research and planning can help you find that success in your mobile app launch.Read more about mobile apps here on Tech.Co",

    "title": "Billboards Now Do Much More Than Just Advertise",
    "content": "Since the invention of lithography and the dawn of modern printing at the turn of the 19th century, billboards, posters, and flyers have been a go-to method for advertising, marketing, and the sharing of ideas and information. But the billboards and digital displays of today are evolving. The days of simple signage are long gone, and so are previous technological limitations.A post by Four Winds Interactive, the Denver based-visual communications company, explains the need for engaging digital signage:\"Digital displays capture 400 percent more views than static displays. Not only do they capture more views, but their recall rate is 83 percent -- significantly higher than any traditional media.\"Displays have a vast number of practicalities today, including use for entertainment and menu display, as well as for wayfinding, advertising, and much more. As signage and marketing efforts evolve, they more regularly include digital interfaces. From holographic billboards, to digital displays, contemporary signage has certainly taken new shape. These concepts are pivotal and reach further than simple advertorial endeavors. We've come a long way since Trivision signs reigned supreme. Here's what's changing in terms of billboards and display tech. If you think that the digital signage lining roadways and sidewalks isn't listening in and looking back: think again.NFC (near field communication) tech isn't just for mobile payments, it's also being using within digital signage to communicate with our smartphones. There are numerous ways in which this tech is relevant to organizations. Businesses are able to literally see their audiences passing by through cameras mounted in signage. Smart billboards in cities also beam content to the phones of people walking or driving past. Whether it's a company like Canon helping pedestrians take the perfect Instagram pictures, or the people of Russia utilizing this tech to hide advertisements for banned foods from police, the uses of this technology are almost limitless!While people in Russia are already relying on sly tactics to hide banned advertising, police forces are on the flip side of digital display tech. Law enforcement officers will more than likely continue to inject surveillance and facial recognition systems into signage in public spaces in the coming years. At the forefront of surveillance tech is the modern phenomenon of facial recognition systems. This sci-fi-tech-turned-reality is exploding with promise. For example, Google's powerful algorithms are already intelligent enough to connect photos of adults with their childhood pictures. And Facebook is using algorithms that can identify people without even seeing their faces by using information on people's unique hair styles, body shapes, and body language. This is all just the beginning of what's in store. Imagine how police forces will be able to use this to their advantage when finding suspects and cybercriminals, catching people conducting fraud and identity theft, and keeping public roads free of speeders and unsafe drivers. If you're like me, this might all make you feel a bit paranoid. But don't fret! If you don't want digital signs spying on you as you walk by, there are already smart glasses on the market that will hide your face from being recognized.But not all of these police adaptations will be used to collect data or locate criminals. In emergency situations, sensitive and timely information can be displayed to people in real time. This is useful in disaster situations such as interstate pileups, wildfires and other extreme weather, or when states of emergency have been called. Related: 5 Retail Tech Trends in 2016As surprising as it sounds, billboards are actually being used to solve important world issues.For starters, we all know that mosquitoes are one of the most problematic creatures on the planet. Mosquitoes are responsible for the spread of countless diseases, including problems such as the Zika virus, which has become a top public health concern. A creative approach to controlling these pesky pests comes in the form of, you guessed it: signage. Billboards equipped with powerful lights and replicated human scents can now attract mosquitoes from as far as 2.5 km away. These billboards trap hundreds of Ziki-infected mosquitoes per day. Talk about killer advertising techniques! Lima, the largest city in Peru, has two huge, long-standing, public health issues. The city has the worst pollution in Latin America and limited amounts of safe drinking water. Thankfully, Peru's University of Engineering and Technology is tackling these two problems with one sustainable billboard concept. An article on Entrepreneur elaborates:\"When it comes to producing clean oxygen, the billboard is reportedly as powerful as 1,200 trees, producing 100,000 cubic meters of purified air. The technology works by taking in the polluted air, pulling it through a water filtration system and releasing clean air that reaches up to a five-block radius.\"The billboards also produced almost 10,000 liters of clean drinking water in its first three months of operation. It did this by collecting water vapor right out of the air. Tech and trade shows go hand in hand, that much is certain. And at the forefront of any engaging trade show booth stands captivating signage in the form of graphics, displays, and other digitally displayed media. A highly relevant trade show, the Digital Sign Expo, was last month. This is the world's biggest annual signage convention, and took place in Las Vegas this year. The expo attracts hundreds of exhibitors and thousands of attendees. The Digital Sign Expo truly represents the digital signage niche to a tee. As the world's signage progresses from flat, boring pieces of paper, to complex, digital billboards, how else will the digital displays of tomorrow continue to change?

    "title": "4 Ways to Use In-Store Media for Cross-Channel Marketing",
    "content": "Retail companies that excel at engaging with customers across multiple marketing channels have twice the retention rate compared to average merchants, according to research from the Aberdeen Group.Cross-channel marketing is a successful retail strategy because it follows your audience's activity from channel to channel, effectively increasing sales opportunities at each touch-point. For example, if a prospect is browsing a product on your website but abandons his shopping cart before completing the purchase, you can use cross-channel engagement to re-market the product they looked at via an alternate medium, including a Facebook ad or email marketing campaign.Considering that the last five years of digital ad saturation has resulted in an epidemic of banner blindness, it's become clear that marketing efforts must innovate, expanding to multiple touch-points both in and outside the home. A seamless approach across various channels - especially inside a physical retail space - guides your potential customers toward heightened engagement, increasing brand equity and sales. Since 72 percent of consumers prefer an integrated approach to marketing, cross-channel engagement is worth mastering.Your retail space has incredible touch-point potential, providing access to your customers via multiple messaging conduits within the store: packaging, in-store video, on-shelf displays, and the opportunity to enhance their brick-and-mortar experience by taking them online while they're inside the store. Read on for ideas for using in-store media to achieve higher brick-and-mortar cross-channel marketing effectiveness:With 82 percent of purchasing decisions are made in-store, it makes sense to talk to your customers while they're browsing. Eight out of ten of them are already on their phones while in the store, so if you don't offer WiFi, you've just lost out on the huge opportunities afforded by people's preference to research products, compare prices and read reviews while shopping.Historically, many merchants see in-store mobile access as a threat considering shoppers can use their smartphones for showrooming, but now it has become clear that shoppers are demanding a cross-channel experience. Offer free, branded WiFi that automatically lands your customers on your homepage (or a strategically designed landing page pushing a specific promotion), empowering them to engage with you throughout their shopping journey.Because customers respond best to cohesive brand experiences, it's imperative to integrate your in-store marketing with social media. One of the easiest and most cost effective ways to accomplish this is by displaying hashtags through offline media within the store.Memorable, concise, and branded hashtags can fit anywhere in a brick-and-mortar environment. Utilize them on your signage, mention them on your in-store promotional radio programming, and be sure to display them on your in-store infotainment. That way, your customers can join an ongoing conversation when they post to social media about your brand, making it easier for you to engage with them online and helping to spread your messaging to your customers' social graphs.Point-of-sale video screens have become exceedingly popular as brick-and-mortar marketing touch points, and they're perfect for promoting branded hashtags. The checkout is the ideal place to place a smart screen, since people hate waiting in lines. Innovative digital signage at grocery stores reduces perceived wait times by more than a third, and 84 percent of customers claim that watching content on in-store displays helps the time spent waiting in the checkout line pass more quickly. Displaying a hashtag for several seconds at the end of a video clip can be highly effective for driving online engagement among your offline audience.As small devices that communicate with nearby smartphones, beacons can also be effective for gathering information about audience members, and they can also be used to notify consumers about relevant promotions, based on their movements through your store. Although still in its infancy states, beacon technology is considered an uber-effective in-store strategy, having influenced some $15 billion in offline spending over this past Black Friday weekend.Beacons, however, are not yet an industry standard.  While there's no shortage of case studies proving the effectiveness of beacons as an in-store marketing tool, many experts have expressed reservations based on consumers' privacy concerns.Long lines kill sales. Nearly 50 percent of all customers will purposely avoid a retailer in the future if they had to wait longer than five minutes in line. With a mobile POS solution, however, you can empower your customers to skip the line completely, and check out right next to the shelf where their purchase awaits.In addition, mobile POS allows your cashiers to double as knowledgeable sales consultants, differentiating you with exceptional customer service. With tablets in hand, your sales staff can approach customers who are in the middle of their decision-making processes; team members can provide advice and suggest upsells.According to data cited by Harvard Business School, retailers utilizing multiple marketing channels are more profitable than those employing only a single channel. Brick-and mortar environments are ideal for creating numerous touch-points with your customers, and the variety of in-store media solutions available today make it accessible and affordable to do so.Read more about marketing here on Tech.Co",

    "title": "4 Legitimate Reasons to Fire a Toxic Client",
    "content": "Business ventures are a give-and-take experience. Having a healthy relationship with your clients is necessary for your business to succeed. There's the key word: \"healthy.\" Both you and your client have to establish a healthy relationship on both sides.Obviously, you and your client have separate goals, but the end result you want is to benefit both parties. Yet we've all been taught that the client is always right. But if the relationship becomes toxic and the customer becomes highly unprofitable, it is wise to walk away from the relationship and let them choose a new vendor. Let's take a look at some examples of red-flag behaviors that could signal a potentially toxic client:An overly communicative client is someone who contacts you way too much. Communication is key for a healthy relationship. However, just like a romantic relationship, you need your own space and time.If they're calling late at night and sending too many emails, texts, or voicemails that could be handled during business hours -- these are all bad signs. If it's a red flag in a relationship, it's a red flag in business.Clients should recognize that you have other clients who you need to be spending time on. Prioritizing one client sets you up to let them down later when you can't afford to pay as much attention to them. This can happen for many reasons, from an increase in business to the realization that you've given too much to this client and are now stuck.They say time is money. Not everyone wants to pay for all that time consistently, though. If this comes up with a client you recently started working with, it can be a cause for concern. In this day and age of free music and free news, people often have unfair expectations of free (or very cheap) services.They wouldn't want this turned back on them if they owned a business, though, and this is your company. You need to be firm and clearly express how much time you can spend on a specific project and what that will cost.Clients reach out to you for services you can provide that they can't do on their own. Because of this, they should respect that fact and not try to get lower prices or \"deals\" for your services. Naturally, you can and should help them out slightly if there are reasonable circumstances, but if you give in too much, you risk damaging your brand. If this issue keeps coming up, it might be better to part ways with the client.That's not to say, however, that you shouldn't make small concessions or be lenient with your time or pricing when it comes to clients you have an established relationship with. After all, you never want to do anything that could jeopardize your important relationships.Whether it's a client you recently started working with or one you have collaborated with for some time, never let business matters be conducted in an aggressive tone. You need to always keep a cool head to make sure business is conducted professionally and reasonably.It's key to remember that not every client is valuable. There are some that you can not only live without, but would be better off doing so. If you find yourself frequently thinking negatively about a client, it might be time to reconsider your relationship with them.\"Every customer isn't valuable -- there are some that we can certainly live without,\" said Candice Galek, founder and CEO of Bikini Luxe, in an Inc article. \"Like the customers who are headaches for your company, for example. The ones who won't lead to any more referrals or sales, and who give your staff trouble time and again.\"Remember that you can always find new clients. You can't, however, recover wasted time or image trying to satisfy a client who will never be satisfied. You deserve the respect and the satisfaction of fair compensation for all your hard work, and you should be confident your prices are already very fair.Read more about business tips here on Tech.CoA version of this article originally appeared here.

    "title": "5 Classic Inbox Personalities and How to Respond to Them",
    "content": "Everyone has a tendency to misread client emails. The tones we hear in our heads can dictate our responses, which can easily hinder working relationships and impact the success of a project. Unfortunately, we can't pick what personalities land in our inbox. But we can try to understand them and pinpoint certain emails, helping us learn how to communicate more efficiently with clients (without pulling our hair out).Our PR team has generated a list of the top five types of personalities we see every day in our inbox, along with solutions for the best way to respond.You went to bed with a clean inbox, only to wake up to a horrifying number of unread emails from the same person; each discussing the same topic with disjointed thoughts and ideas. Did you reply quickly enough? Clearly not, because now you have another slew of unread emails following up on whether you had received those previous emails. Suddenly, your inbox has been taken over by a client who needs affirmation, constant communication, and handholding at their convenience.Be calm. It's all about training your clients by setting email boundaries. Do not answer those emails right away (unless there is a serious crisis). Send one single email that addresses only the pertinent information crucial for campaign success. These emails create a false sense of urgency and will only cause you more stress if you don't take a step back and realize this barrage doesn't mean the world is falling apart. The Hounder email personality simply wants to know you're there and are listening.All you needed was one simple answer to a quick question, or a quick quote regarding the news you're pushing. Instead, you have received the annotated version of War and Peace. Our best suggestion? Skim the page until you find keywords where the actual response to your original inquiry is hiding, or be extremely specific in the what you are asking for, limiting their ability to diverge into tangents.Once you've done this, explain why the information they provided is important to the success of the campaign. Be sure to move forward in case they decide at the last minute to pull out of an amazing opportunity. After all, those novel-length emails will prove to be your best asset to help your client recall decisions they've made that have stalled any success on your part.These clients seem to be impossible to reach during pivotal moments of a campaign. They take days to respond to an action that needs immediate attention, or take weeks to green light a timely pitch. The radio silence becomes too much to handle when they stop calling into those mandatory conference calls that they'd schedule weekly. To deal with this reality, you should prepare all materials for future use.Collect information ahead of time so that you do not have to rely heavily on their presence. If they need to green light every idea, get their approval ahead of time in an email so you have permission to go after timely opportunities. Don't be afraid to call your client when you're stuck between a rock and a hard place and cannot move forward unless they are available.Sometimes, it's hard not to laugh when a client is in good spirits and sends an unexpected GIF to highlight a success, no matter how big or small. However, we're talking about the \"GIF-ers\" who incessantly send GIFs that become a waste of space in our inbox.Don't feel tempted to send GIFs in response; they are distracting and are not going to aid in your team's productivity. GIFs and memes can quickly become overwhelming and misconstrued within seconds: Avoid reading into them by simply ignoring them. This rule also applies for emojis.Don't you love it when everyone in the office is copied on an email that only requires the initial person's response? We call these people Tattlers, as they seem to want every conversation in every person's inbox.Discretion and looping in the correct recipients does not seem to be of concern. Always assume every email you send and receive will have outside eyes on it. Be aware of the content in your email, and clearly label who you are directly emailing. Follow your client's protocol in continuing to loop in the team, even if they one-off email you. This allows the client to slowly reshape their CC-ing tendencies.Read more about office culture here on Tech.CoThis article is courtesy of BusinessCollective, featuring thought leadership content by ambitious young entrepreneurs, executives & small business owners.",

    "title": "4 Renewable Energy Startups to Watch in 2017",
    "content": "Businesses are often wrongly generalized as commercial organizations that only seek profits. But in this new age of entrepreneurism, startups are rising not only for financial gain, but also for the betterment of the less fortunate and the planet as a whole.Aside from social ventures that are steadily proliferating for the past ten years, companies that pursue renewable energy are also gaining ground. In fact, reports suggest that solar energy jobs are growing twelve times much faster than the US economy itself.While these ventures may not grow into billion-dollar firms any time soon, they are driven towards the most important goal of all - preserving the future for everyone. Below are some of the startups that are leading the charge toward a renewable future:Some developing countries still depend heavily on charcoal or firewood as cooking fuel. This, however, has a tremendous negative impact on forests and woodlands, especially with the lack of a strategy that enables the sustainable utilization of these resources.HiGi Energy is a Philippines-based startup that converts water hyacinth - a type of aquatic plant that are generally considered pests - into cooking energy. In recognition of the company's ingenuity, HiGi was awarded at the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit held in Silicon Valley.Living in a technology-driven world, introducing sustainable energy solutions is indeed a daunting challenge. While everyone is too busy exploring the possibilities with IoT and building smart homes, Totem has its sights on something much bigger - smart cities and a cleaner way of powering them.For this, Totem aims to develop a revolutionary product that incorporates solar energy, energy storage, 4G, WiFi, and electric vehicle charging into a single infrastructure. While the company was originally founded in 2015, it didn't reach global launch until November of 2016. The first totem model, on the other hand, is set to be released sometime this summer.Deploying wind turbines is one of the most effective and widespread strategies for providing renewable energy. But due to workforce and red tape barriers, the utilization of wind energy is hindered in developing countries.Avant Garde Innovations, a renewable energy startup in India, has a vision to make the benefits of renewable wind energy accessible to average Indian residents. With turbines that only cost as much as an iPhone, the company plans to end the dependence on power grids and create more self-sufficient communities.\"Such innovative, sustainable, and affordable solutions that can take the energy empowerment with renewable sources are the need of the hour,\" says Sumit Porwal in a story on Avant Garde Innovations.By applying concepts from the blockchain and IoT technologies into self-powered communities, DAJIE aims to make peer-to-peer energy sharing more sensible. Basically, it works through a network of nodes in a single \"micro-grid,\" which enables users to execute transactions using clean energy.DAJIE, which stands for Distributed Autonomous Joint Internet & Energy for Everyone, was founded in Italy back in 2015. Although the idea of open-source energy sharing sounds truly promising, the product is still undergoing tests with the help of a micro-grid pilot program in the University of Rome.Read more about environmentally conscious startups here on Tech.Co",

    "title": "4 Companies Using IBM Watson to Advance Artificial Intelligence Technology",
    "content": "Thinking computers no longer belong in fiction. For the past few years, people have witnessed the AI revolution unfold - from virtual assistants that can sing you 'happy birthday' to AI-infused fitness coaches that provide you with real-time encouragement. With industry leaders like Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and IBM leading the charge, consumers and businesses alike expect the revolution to pick up the pace.Today, one of the most promising AI solutions available in the market would be IBM Watson. Named after IBM's first CEO, Watson is a question answering system that incorporates natural language processing, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and machine learning.What's really impressive about Watson is that it allows developers to build a working chatbot within a few minutes. Other than text input, the platform also supports a handful of APIs for the utilization of data such as the user's tone of voice, visual cues, and more.Here are some of the notable tech startups that use Watson to deliver AI-powered experiences to users:It makes sense for companies to apply Watson for augmenting customer service, but the platform is much more flexible than that. Tripbru is a smart tourism platform that leverages Watson's capabilities to enhance the experience of visitors in hotels, museums, resorts, and other attractions. It works through a mobile app, which offers interactive and entertaining content with gamification elements.For example, users can earn points by taking selfies in certain locations, which they can use later to redeem exclusive gifts. Tripbru also supports eCommerce functions such as souvenir purchases, ticket preorders, and Q&A support.Local Motors - the company responsible for the world's first fully functional 3D-printed car - took a step further by integrating Watson into their line of self-driving buses nicknamed 'Olli'. With Watson's language and speech recognition abilities, passengers only need to say their desired destination as if they're talking to a human cab driver. Olli will then take them to the location with the help of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), radar technology, and cameras at a safe speed of 12 miles per hour.Of course, the safety of Olli's riders is still the top priority of Local Motors. This is why the buses are constantly monitored by humans, even though Watson is proven to react faster and have better judgment than any living person.MusicGeek takes digital music recommendations to a whole new level with the help of Watson. Apart from obtaining insights from select music blogs and biographies, the platform also leverages a goldmine of data that interconnects artists, genres, venues, and performances to turn Watson into the ultimate music recommendation platform.MusicGeek is developed and currently offered by the company Quantone, which covers a library of over 15 million tracks and counting. When added to the recommendations, tracks are accompanied by comprehensive details such as the recording location, release data, beats per minute and genre.Small businesses and startups can now bring Watson aboard their customer service and sales through platforms like Refine.Ai. By integrating a chatbot software into your business website, you can save a lot of time and money on customer service as well as eliminate the costs of human error. It will also enable you to build a more approachable brand that does not depend on the availability of support agents to help customers in need.Refine.Ai works by developing a custom chatbot solution that's specifically tailored to the needs of any company. And to make sure the chatbots work as intended, the platform also aggregates data for future optimizations as well as enable human intervention at any point of conversations.Read more about artificial intelligence at Tech.Co",

    "title": "Startup Launches Real-Time Online Cannabis Marketplace",
    "content": "Individuals and medical professionals looking for cannabis online rarely know exactly how much inventory a dispensary might have at that point of time. Fortunately, one startup has changed that forever.Today, startup Jane Technologies launched the cannabis industry's first end-to-end online marketplace, where customers can find and order preferred products available in real-time at local dispensaries.The difference between Jane and other marketplaces online is notable. The platform keeps tabs on a dispensary's supply through a point-of-sale system and allows consumers to search their site for items in real-time. You can compare prices, products and services with other dispensaries in their area, and reserve preferred items for in-store pickup or delivery.When a consumer wants to read reviews on a product, Jane has made an effort to combat a growing problem of fake product reviews and only allows customers who have used the platform to provide feedback.\"Consumers today want a certain experience when shopping online; they expect smarter searches with custom recommendations, and we believe the cannabis industry should be no different,\" said Socrates Rosenfeld, CEO of Jane and combat vet who discovered the health benefits of cannabis while studying at MIT, in a press release.Consumers are given free access to one of the industry's largest cannabis product databases and can filter by location, price, and popularity. The company is also trying to assist dispensaries that are tired of crowded listings, manual menus, and losing customers with this point-of-sale platform to help boost sales.\"We also recognize that dispensaries are the backbone of this industry - and they're tired of relying solely on expensive advertising to reach new customers,\" Rosenfeld said. \"We're committed to supporting those visionary operators who see where the industry is headed, and want to provide their customers with a simple and straightforward shopping experience - all while seamlessly operating within compliance of state law.\"Jane Technologies cofounders include graduates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and is led by former Army captain and West Point graduate Socrates Rosenfeld. Jane is currently partnering with dispensaries in Santa Cruz and rapidly expanding into additional California, Colorado, and Boston markets.\"By partnering with dispensaries who pride themselves on providing the highest quality products and services to their community, we help consumers become more confident in the way they shop for cannabis,\" said Rosenfeld.Read more about startups around the country here at Tech.Co",

    "title": "Study: Americans Don't Know How to Protect Their Online Data",
    "content": "Technology is a double edged sword. While it allows you to keep in contact with friends, check the weather in an instant, and watch more television series than should ever be allowed, it also opens up startups, corporations, and everyday citizens to cyber attacks and hacks that could result in millions of dollars in losses. And with all that on the line, you'd think people would understand the importance of protecting your online data. Unfortunately, you couldn't be more wrong.According to a recent study from the Pew Research Center, Americans are wildly uninformed about the means by which they can protect themselves from hackers itching to steal their personal online data. In a thirteen-question survey, Americans were tested on their knowledge of a number of cybersecurity issues and terms. And they didn't do very well.It is worth noting that most Americans aren't doing anything wrong. They aren't misinformed about how to protect their online data from potential hackers, rather they aren't informed at all. As you can see from the above graph, the most common response to most answers was \"not sure,\" pointing to a general lack of information opposed to misinformation.\"Although the share of online adults who can correctly answer questions about cybersecurity issues varies from topic to topic, in most cases the share providing an actual incorrect answer is relatively small,\" wrote the authors of the study. \"Rather, many users indicate that they simply are not sure of the correct answer to a large number of the questions in this survey.\"With questions ranging from email encryption and WiFi traffic to free credit reports and private browsing, it's no wondering Americans are struggling to keep up. The cybersecurity sector is as broad as it is vital, making everyday citizens confused, overwhelmed, and downright annoyed. However, if you are truly committed to making sure you are protected from malware, hacks, ransomware, and any other type of cyber attack, understanding these questions is the first step in ensuring your digital safety.Read more about cybersecurity here on Tech.CoPhoto: Flickr / Blue Coat Photos",

    "title": "Old School Marketing Tips that Still Work Like Magic!",
    "content": "The marketing world is full of flashy innovations that are sure to make any marketer from the 90's drool with excitement and envy.You've got all the social media marketing magic that can reach thousand of people with a click of a button. Video ads that you can force people to watch through apps and Youtube. Banner ads that promote your content to thousands of web pages with minimal effort.If these marketing methods were available 20 years ago, the door-to-door salesmen would have a field day.However, even having said that, we shouldn't forget that back in the day (when times were simpler) -- when all the salesmen had were TV, radio, and print ads -- they were still able to accomplish a lot. They had several creative tips and tricks that not only used the most advanced technology of their time but also focused on the psychology of marketing and how to use it to a marketer's advantage.Let's take a look at some of the old school marketing tips and tricks that people used, so we can incorporate them into our existing marketing efforts.Let's face it, we'll always trust someone we know who has no personal agenda of making money, over an ad that promises the world and the moon whom we know is just trying to get us to part with our money.Though word-of-mouth marketing might sometimes be the slowest form of marketing, it will always remain the most trustworthy form of marketing available.With word of mouth marketing (WOMM), you don't need to keep building the trust with each and every person. The trust is organic, as people trust their peers who can vouch for you or your product. If two or three people I trust says it's good, then it must be worth a try, right?These days you don't need to wait for someone from a person's social web to try your product to take advantage of WOMM. Online reviews are based heavily on this concept as they just boost peer word-of-mouth marketing and boost it to a global level as practically anyone can leave you a good review to encourage others to try your product.With the advent of social media and online reviews, Kimberly Whitler of Forbes.com writes that the common pitfall of WOMM is that marketers often focus more on collecting followers for their brand and not connecting with them. Remember that a Facebook like is nowhere near as effective as a positive review about your products and the reviewer telling others to try your product.There are two very common techniques that pro marketers used back in the day that really played with human psychology to get you to close the sale, and they both have something to do with doors: The Door-In-The-Face (DITF) technique and the Foot-In-The-Door (FITD) technique. Both are powerful persuasion techniques that have earned their place in the playbooks of the most seasoned marketers.As an example, if someone sold you a Rolex for $10,000, most of us would likely say no without a second thought as no one really carries $10,000 in their wallet. But when you offer a cheaper alternative at $100, the alternative suddenly looks way more enticing after being exposed to the more expensive Rolex. This is the Door-In-The-Face (DITF) technique in action. The DITF technique involves getting the client to turn down something big or expensive, and then offering them something smaller or cheaper that they're more likely to purchase. There's a bunch of research that discusses as to why it works, but let's take the word of millions of marketers who've used it, and trust that it does, alright?The Foot-In-The-Door (FITD) technique, on the other hand, works in contrast to the DITF technique. The concept of FITD is that if you get the client to say \"yes\" to something small, they will be better inclined to say \"yes\" to your bigger offer. Back in the day, a salesman would put his foot in the door and ask to at least have a minute of the client's time.So how do we use these techniques in today's modern era?With the DITF technique, you may ask for something outrageous with an online ad, like offer a three-year subscription worth a thousand dollars, and then give them a great offer they can't refuse like a 30-day free trial. The contrast highlights the great value of the free trial in comparison to the thousand dollar subscription.With the FITD technique, you may ask your audience for a simple request that requires minimal effort -- Facebook likes, Twitter follows, or an auto-playing video. This then paves the way for a more positive response to bigger requests like email addresses, subscribing for free trials, and maybe even a purchase.At this point, I'm sure you've had your fair share of seeing bajillions of ads floating around the internet. They're everywhere! But when you're on the fine line where you're already a little bit interested and you're a few questions away from clicking that ad, who's there to hold on to you and answer your questions?Especially with a complicated product, the ability to answer questions about your product will almost always beat a generic ad that you see on a web page. That's where telemarketers come in.A telemarketer can introduce and adapt a sales pitch to how the client reacts to the product. They can expound how a product works and explain a whole page worth of benefits without the target client growing bored of it. Not only that, they can also use several effective closing techniques that are meant to keep the client on the line and close the sale.More importantly, a telemarketer has the ability to make personal connections that no video or print ad can. Even the slightest connection with a client can leave a lasting impression that can lead to all sorts of opportunities for any business.Read more about marketing here on Tech.Co ",

    "title": "8 Web Design Mistakes That Can Prove Fatal to Your Website",
    "content": "So you've hired someone to give your boring website a new lease of life. Great initiative, no doubt about that. But even after spending your hard earned money on the look and feel of your design, it still may not attract your targeted audience. Don't let this happen to your website because this could directly impact on your business prospect. Here are some designing issues that can make or break the design of your website:Don't focus on conversions only. Think like a normal human being and keep aside those conversion mumbo-jumbos for a second. The above the fold section is not a place to put larger than life images or featuring the Call to Action buttons only. Nope, you need to add some context so people don't need to scroll down and figure out what the page is all about.Yes, I am fully aware of the fact that flash websites look awesome. But you should not ignore its shortcomings, mainly that it takes years to get loaded properly. You should not forget the fact that flash websites are inherently SEO unfriendly. You will have just one single page to load all the content of the website, and that means you could have little scope to optimize your website. And with more readers on mobile, the wait time to load can be a deterrent as well.In my personal opinion, this is the worst thing that you can have on your website as this will eventually slow down the website. Moreover, instead of helping your visitors find your website, you are actually making it harder for general visitors to access it. Reconsider having a splash page at all and get your customers to your company site.I am not saying that you have to make your website all browsers friendly. However, you at least need to make sure that your website is rendering precisely in major browsers - like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer.This is the weirdest thing that you can do with your site. It is funny to repeat small images horizontally or vertically. The problem is that these tactics increase the loading time of your website and become a turn off for customers to progress through your site.This is another feature that is unwarranted and that you can safely ignore. Adding pop-up pages is really annoying to users and could turn your visitors away. If you are going to decide on pop ups, then minimize it because having those interrupt the site all the time could be the biggest mistake and annoy your visitor.We do not see any reason why you should disable right click on your site. Just because you have disabled right click on your website does not mean that they will not be able to copy and paste the information. Nope, everything is available right on the source code and therefore, there is no need to trouble the visitors by disabling right click.

    "title": "Women in Tech Should Be the Rule, Not the Exception",
    "content": "We've all heard different versions of the same statistic: According to the Census, women make up 59 percent of the entire workforce in the United States and 51 percent of the country's total population, yet women account for just 30 percent of the labor pool in the tech industry. What's more, only about 16 percent of those women hold technical positions and a mere 23 percent are in leadership roles.That's embarrassing. As the father of two daughters--one in junior high school--I find those facts troubling. What's even more infuriating is the inequity in pay among men and women: Women are making only about 80 cents for every dollar earned by men. My wife and I are raising our daughters to chase their dreams, to become whatever it is they want to become. These statistics force me to acknowledge--to myself and to them--that like all women, my daughters will be swimming against the current.What is encouraging is that this important issue of women being underrepresented in tech--as well as LGBTQ folks and people of color--  continues to attract more and more attention. Startups and industry leaders are hosting events and even launching entire incubators focused on diversity and inclusion. And this goes beyond tech. Hell, the Women's March on January 21, the day after President Trump's inauguration, galvanized millions of women and members of other underrepresented communities and their supporters, not just in the United States but all over the world.All of that's great--but there's still a lot of work that needs to be done.At Galvanize, I'm proud to say that more than half of our executive leadership team is comprised of women. We've also had recent cohorts with high percentages of female students. In Boulder, for example, G32 and G36 were 60 percent and 46 percent women, respectively. Still, that's not nearly good enough. We need to strive for those kinds of numbers consistently across all of our cohorts.Working for equality isn't just the right thing to do--and by the way, that should be enough motivation for each and every one of us to do all we can do--the fact is, it's also the right thing to do for business and for the economy. Studies conducted by the National Center for Women & Information Technology have shown that gender-diverse companies:This is such a big, broad topic that I think sometimes it can feel daunting to even begin to tackle; at least, I know that's how I often feel. On our Galvanize campuses in Denver and Boulder we're fortunate to have a group called gWomen that meets monthly to dig in on one specific topic or theme related to women in tech. This month at the Boulder meetup, Alison Hughes, who spent nine years as a software engineer at Apple and recently co-founded her own consulting business, Little Barn, spoke on an important aspect of this problem: Imposter Syndrome.Oh, and Alison also studied biology at UCLA and before her Apple days spent about a decade as breakbeat techno DJ.Yeah, she's a badass.So, undoubtedly successful by just about any measure, Alison began by talking about how still to this day she sometimes feels like a professional \"imposter,\" and went on to explain that that's a real thing. Alison defined \"Imposter Syndrome\" this way: \"A pervasive feeling of self doubt, insecurity, or fraudulence, despite often overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\"Think of it like this, she said: You've just received a prestigious, well-earned promotion, and you walk into a meeting at which everyone congratulates you. What do you say? Maybe something like, Others helped me get here or I got lucky. That, Alison explained, is bullshit. What Imposter Syndrome does is prevent women from proudly announcing the real answer. Something like: I earned this or I was the best person for the job. To this day, Alison said, she still struggles with taking credit, even when it's abundantly and clearly appropriate. She said it all comes down to how you perceive your own ability. She implored the other women in the room at the meetup to believe in themselves and take credit for what they've earned. (Also: Apparently, 70 percent of the population experiences some form of Imposter Syndrome, and it's not just women.)As a CEO of a tech company, when I think about what Alison had to say it gets me thinking about how lucky I am to have a ton of smart talented women on my team and in my life--and how none of them are imposters. It gets me to thinking about all of Galvanize's brilliant female students and alumni, and of the female business founders who have chosen to launch and build their companies with and within the Galvanize community.As a father of two young girls, when I consider the real challenges of Imposter Syndrome, it also makes me think about how Galvanize and other industry leaders need to do more on this issue. It should go without saying, but it needs to be said, and actually, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg might have said it best: \"Women belong in all places where decisions are being made.... It shouldn't be that women are the exception.\"That, more or less, is what I tell my two daughters. But I think it's also a message that CEOs and leaders in the tech industry need to send more loudly and regularly to their colleagues and employees. Indeed, it shouldn't be that women are the exception. Let's make women the rule.Read more about women in tech here on Tech.CoImage: WOCinTechThis article is courtesy of the Galvanize blog.

    "title": "5 Ways to Secure Your Email Conversations",
    "content": "As mobility and accessibility increases, so does the emergence of new security threats that seek to steal your most confidential information. Since businesses communicate primarily through email, it's important to always keep your system updated with the latest security software. You need to be in the know with safety measures to keep yourself (or your business team) protected. Here are five ways to make sure your email and conversations are secure:Every IT expert will tell you, passwords serve as our own digital keys to our personal network. Maintaining a strong password can help protect against someone grabbing your email and easily use the \"forgot your password?\" link to get routed to your personal information.A strong password needs to be unique and complex with a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols and numbers. It's suggested to use at least eight characters long because the more characters your passwords contain, the more difficult it is to crack. And finally, stop using personal information on your password such as birth dates and names as these could be easily traced back to you. They should be as random as possible.Email hackers have gotten so complex nowadays that they could easily obtain your messages, its content, and attachments if your email is not secured. To secure email, it is important to encrypt your messages, cached email and connection to your email provider.Leaving these unencrypted could lead to another network user gaining access to your credentials and intercepting any data you send or receive. This often holds true when using public networks at coffee shops, libraries or airports that are often easy prey to hackers.Making them unreadable through encryption the moment they are sent ensures no one else can obtain them other than the recipient. And even if someone is able to intercept and open your messages, encryption helps ensure your messages will stay unreadable.Sometimes it is easy to forget that most browsers are keeping track of your search history and have filled out forms that could contain personal information. For this reason, make it a habit to delete all your browser cache and history daily, especially when accessing your email through public networks in cafes.There are many  signs of phishing attacks through email, which include making use of a company's logo, a threat of legal action, a security notification or warning from a reputable company to get you to update your personal information and many more. Although it is difficult to prevent yourself from opening phishing emails, it is more important to learn to double check the sender, verify someone sent you a particular email and question emails unfamiliar email senders.Many of us now using more than one mobile device or gadget to access and transact online. Make sure to always log out from each device before transferring to another to avoid anyone snooping in on your private conversations or even worse, using your accounts to transact online on active devices.As security threats evolve and grow more difficult to prevent, it is up to us to learn and keep ourselves updated with whatever it takes to keep our email and information secure.Read more about preventing cyberattacks on your business at Tech.Co",

    "title": "How to Leverage NPS to Grow Your Business",
    "content": "Regardless of your organization's size, industry, or type, there's one key performance indicator that--when measured and leveraged properly--can have a profound impact on the vitality of your business. This indicator isn't new, and the logic behind it has been around for decades. In fact, there's a good chance you're already using it. I'm talking about Net Promoter Score (NPS), a tool used to gauge customer loyalty.While simplistic in its format, NPS can deliver powerful insights for virtually any business--from startups to Fortune 500 companies. For most organizations, though, the common practice is to send out the NPS survey a couple times per year (or shortly after a new sale has been made). But by experimenting with the frequency and timing of NPS surveys--and thinking strategically about where the resulting feedback goes--business leaders can use this score to uncover a goldmine of intel they can leverage to dramatically improve the customer experience, which directly correlates with the bottom line.An NPS survey asks one simple question: on a scale of 0 to 10, how likely is it that you would recommend us to a friend? The respondent's answer then indicates whether he or she is a promoter, detractor, or passive.Promoters are your brand's loyal enthusiasts. They're the ones who keep purchasing your product and urge others to do the same. Passives are satisfied, but won't necessarily stick around if something they perceive to be better comes along. Detractors are the unhappy or dissatisfied customers who may spread their dissatisfaction to their circles of influence, thus detracting from your business.That initial feedback certainly provides a good jumping-off point, but at my company, we knew we could do more with it. So last year, we implemented a new strategy around our NPS, and from that point forward, it became a high-priority, company-wide metric for us in terms of customer service delivery.Previously, we sent out NPS surveys to customers every six months. Eventually, we realized that we needed a more consistent stream of product feedback. So, we divided our customers into cohorts and began emailing surveys to a different group of people each week. This means that, while each individual still completes only two surveys per year, we're now able to collect feedback from across our customer base every single week.As a result, we've been able to better track success and diagnose issues more rapidly--rather than learning about those issues six months down the road. We're also able to correlate these scores with industry trends, downtimes, and product issues that may be occurring.Of course, data is only as valuable as the action it drives. On that note, once we receive our NPS results, we immediately act on them. Comments are divided into four categories: red, yellow, green, and gold. Gold commenters are our promoters, green are passives, and red and yellow are detractors. If a red or yellow comment comes in, a task is automatically created in our CRM, and our success team is notified to reach out to that customer to try and remedy whatever problem he or she is experiencing.Red and yellow comments are also passed along to our product team members, who then reach out to gain more information or to let the customer know that his or her suggestion is being added to the roadmap. This ensures that customers know they're being heard. Green and gold comments go to our customer loyalty manager, who works to enroll those customers in our loyalty program.We also keep all of our executive team members in the loop about our NPS scores by sending a weekly email with that week's score as well as comparisons to the previous week and the same week last year. Executives also see customer comments, which means our customers are having a greater impact on decisions at the highest levels of the company. The value of this feedback extends well beyond improving our support and products; it's critical information for every department to have and act upon.With this methodology in place, NPS is no longer just a number for us--it's a powerful tool we can harness to build better relationships. And that, in turn, has allowed us to better serve our customer base. In fact, our score drastically improved within just six months.Before you send out your next NPS, consider what valuable feedback you may be leaving on the table. Are there opportunities to better collect--and leverage--this data? If so, it could have a huge--and positive--impact on your business growth and bottom line.",

    "content": "What is a digital memory? Everyone's experienced that moment when you know you saw(a file, a picture, or an article)somewhere, but you just can't quite pinpoint where or how to find it. If only that moment was uncommon. Unfortunately, it is likely a regular occurrence for anyone that is on the internet for more than an hour a day. Fortunately, one company is tackling this problem head on.Atlas has made capturing your digital memories across all devices, with no tie in to an OS. I was a little pessimistic. I needed proof that this platform could really track it all, so I sat down with their biggest fan (Buzz) and one of their leadership team members (Travis) to see how it really works in helping you find your digital memories.I did a count of the number of services I had reviewed in the past 6 months, the answer was 137 and whilst lots of them were really solid ideas, and some are destined for unicorn type growth, I couldn't find one solving such a big problem in such an awesome way as Atlas.If you are a founder and are interested in having your story told, please contact Martin here.Read more inspiring interviews here on Tech.Co",

    "title": "10 App Marketing Trends to Dominate Your Industry in 2017 and Beyond",
    "content": "App marketing is changing rapidly. Technological changes, marketing automation, a global shift towards the smartphones, and apps dominating the smartphone industry are changing the app industry in 2017 and beyond.The following 10 app marketing trends are expected to dominate the industry in 2017 and will help you stay ahead of the competition.One of the biggest app marketing trends is none other than a significant increase in post-app advertising and remarketing to increase user engagement and retention.Statistics show that as much as 95 percent of app users will be gone 90 days after downloading.In 2016, the average investment on app retention was quite low.However, brands are now focusing more on post-app marketing to make sure that people use the app after installing it.Post-app ads, remarketing, reward programs, cross-sell, upsell, and email marketing are some of the techniques that app marketers will focus on for retention. This is where you should spend your app marketing budget this year.According to Apsalar, top 20 best media partners will capture over 80 percent of marketing spend in 2017. App marketers are focusing more on the quality of app installs than on the quantity.Marketers and brands, therefore, are more interested in spending ad budget on partnering and featuring their apps on proven media partners irrespective of cost.Get in touch with a top media in your industry today and partner with it.Yes, search ads by Apple are the new thing in app marketing that is sure to dominate in 2017 and beyond.Brands that are using Apple Search Ads are getting outstanding results. The average cost per tap stands at 50 cents while brands are paying $1 per app install. This is not just cheap but the conversion rate, according to Adweek, is around 50 percent.You shouldn't miss Apple search ads.Apple search ads will get all the love from marketers and large and small apps in 2017.App marketers are focusing on conversion optimization. Stats show that 78 percent of app marketers are more concerned about the quality of the installs.This is referred as deeper conversion where marketers try to improve the quality of the install as well as the quantity of the installs.This approach will be adopted by more brands and app marketers in 2017.Influencer marketing is the most cost-effective customer acquisition method.This stands true for apps too. Marketing your app to the people who influence your target audience seems to be the best approach that app marketers will use more than ever in 2017.The biggest challenge in influencer marketing is finding the right influencers. The cost associated with influencer marketing is nothing compared to the app awareness and quality of installs that you receive in return.ASO is the process of improving the visibility of your app in the app store. Just as you do SEO for websites, you should do ASO for apps. ASO will take the app industry in 2017. Statistics show that 63 percent of iOS and 58 percent of android users find new apps by browsing apps in the store.Whether you're promoting your app on Google or Apple store, you cannot do it without ASO anymore. As of now, the two most crucial ranking factors are app title and keywords.App Search Optimization is clearly one of the major trends where you should work for if you've to dominate your industry.It seems surprising, right?It shouldn't be.According to a survey conducted by Google in October 2016, high memory consumption is the number one reason for app abandonment. Some 46 percent of smartphone users reported that they will stop using an app if it consumes a lot of memory.Google calls it 'dealbreaker'.You should consider it the same way if you plan to dominate your industry. Before you do anything else, make sure your app isn't consuming too much memory.Who knows, Google might include it in their app store search algorithm one day?Personalized onboarding is expected to be used by a lot of apps in 2017, as predicted by Get Social. Some of the big apps like Clash of Clans, Beats, Evernote, and others have onboarding flows that keep the users hooked but most of the apps don't have onboarding flows.The idea is to personalize onboarding so that users get to know the real value of the app. Personalizing the onboarding experience should be your top priority in 2017.Google and Apple are serious about reducing, rather removing, all the experience differences between apps and websites.Android Instant Apps and Apple introducing Siri for the desktop are indications where the two giants are heading - towards a platform-agnostic experience that provides a continuous seamless experience to their users.This is what Google and Apple will work on in 2017 and this is where you should invest your app marketing budget in the current year. Make the user experience your top priority by providing them with a smooth cross-platform experience.With the introduction and use of ASO, app localization will dominate the app marketing in 2017. As of now, there aren't many apps that are using app localization to rank better in-store search. Some 13 percent of apps are using localization.Clash of Clans is one, among a few others.There are several ways you can use app localization for marketing.App marketing might be challenging but if you know what's coming, where the trends are leading, and how to use the trends for your benefit, you're in the game. Stick to these ten app marketing trends if you're serious about dominating your industry in 2017 and several years to come.",

    "content": "I'm thrilled to be joining Techstars as managing director for the Barclays Accelerator, Powered by Techstars in New York City. I am taking the torch for this role from the talented Jenny Fielding, who is continuing her role of managing director of Techstars IoT.Over the past five years, I've been fortunate to have helped nurture the largest community of fintech entrepreneurs in the world through Empire Startups. My experience in Fintech started before the hashtag with product management and strategy leadership roles at Blackrock, Goldman Sachs, Instinet, and E*Trade. Most recently, I was the Entrepreneur in Residence for the Barclays Accelerator in NYC.In my past fintech experience, I've learned that building great companies is about throwing out the rulebook, not just creating a mobile friendly version of it. As tweetable as that may sound, it's a wild oversimplification. If you just build it, they won't come. This is especially the case in fintech, where even the greatest hustlers can fail to acquire customers and secure distribution partnerships.My deep dark secret is that I've also been in the belly of the beast and lived to tell the tale. I've been on the inside of the largest and most successful investment banks and asset managers and have built the products that fintech startups seek to disrupt today. I've been an agent of change and I've also been mired in the opposite. Now I'm ready to take that experience and help startups pave their way with new products and disruption.While small, agile startups will always ship technology faster than larger teams, some say Fintech distribution, customer acquisition and trust can't be accelerated. I disagree. We'll do it by capitalizing on the lessons learned by the global Techstars network on building products that instill trust in consumers in order to build great businesses. In tandem with laser-focus product roadmaps by working with our \"enterprise customer-in-residence,\" Barclays, we'll hone the story and test business models by leveraging the top community of Fintech mentors in the world.Ready to knock the cover off fintech?

    "title": "5 Apps for Your Kids to Learn a New Language",
    "content": "According to the Center for Applied Linguistics, there are many advantages to teaching your child another language. Studies suggest that those who learn a second language tend to be better at solving complex problems and thinking creatively. And even if you're not personally committed to making sure your five-year-old learns fluent Finnish, practicing vocabulary and grammar from another language can actually aid your child in learning English principles, and give them a headstart on the foreign language classes they'll take in high school and middle school.However, practicing a new language can also be quite tedious, especially for children with short attention spans. The solution? Make it fun. We've collected five different apps that offer games and stories to make language learning more exciting. You may even find your child wants to use their free time to \"play\" with these entertaining apps.This vocabulary app is perfect for teaching Spanish words to kids ages 3-6. It's bright and colorful, and features a series of matching games focusing on kid-friendly topics likes toys and carnivals. The app can also help kids develop their English reading skills as they practice Spanish speaking.This brand new app for teaching kids Mandarin is already getting excellent press. It comes with over 500 videos and an interactive game center. The videos have children's shows in both English and Mandarin, as well as a long series of classroom videos to instruct children. The games in the game center pair perfectly with the videos to make sure children are getting hands-on practice.This vocabulary app helps teach kids German. It's designed with toddlers in mind, and relies mostly on pictures to teach new words. Kids have the chance to review different scenes and then pick out objects after hearing their name in German. The app also has optional \"outside\" and \"Christmas\" expansions.The Gus on the Go Stories app puts a unique twist on language learning. Kids are immersed in a series of interactive stories as they learn vocabulary and pronunciation. Each story is a familiar fable or fairy tale, but with a few fun silly twists to keep children entertained. The app comes in Spanish, Greek, Hebrew, and French, and appeals to a range of ages. Though it's fairly basic in its functionality, this French-teaching app completely delivers on its promise of fun. The six different games focus on spelling, pronunciation, and vocabulary. The games are very engaging and easy for children ages 3-10 to pick up on. As an added bonus, it's also free.Read more about mobile apps here on Tech.Co",

    "title": "Prepping For an Investor Pitch? Don't Get Blinded by Tunnel Vision",
    "content": "For a startup founder, enthusiasm is a necessary piece of the personality puzzle. You took the leap and started your business because you believe in it. Whether you're solving a major technology problem, disrupting a stagnant industry or providing a service that will make life more enjoyable, you've reached your current level of success because you're confident in your concept or product. A natural extension of hard work and faith that your ideas are valuable has helped you reach your goals.There's no need to sell yourself on what you're doing because you're already all in. But that's not necessarily true of the VCs and other investors who will help your startup get where it needs to go. Startup tunnel vision is one of the few negative consequences of the courage and self-assurance of the entrepreneurial spirit. If you remain too focused on your confident belief in what you're doing, it can be difficult to shift gears and put yourself in the shoes of a skeptical investor. It's easy to believe that everyone will share your enthusiasm for such a brilliant concept, but that kind of confidence can actually hold you back.Once you've taken your blinders off and widened your focus to include an outside perspective, you're ready to approach the fundraising process with some finesse. These steps are crucial in converting raw faith into a useful strategy.An ego-driven founder might sit and wait for investors to swarm like bees to honey, but a smart founder knows better. You have to be informed and make smart choices about who you approach, and that means doing a ton of research to find compatible parties. As you look into potential investors, your confidence will be an asset that grants courage to approach some major players.If you think you're the next big thing, you can use that confidence to hit an investor where it hurts. Research the individuals and groups you're approaching during funding rounds and find out if they've missed out on any big opportunities in the past. Drawing a direct connection between your efforts and someone else's success allows you to use your confidence to your advantage.Selling your startup as a sure thing can cause some investors to balk. If you're already all set, what do you need them for? Most VCs want to find a good team to partner with, and some even actively seek out startups looking for guidance or mentorship of some sort. Overconfidence can be a big turn off in these cases. Plus, it can actually end up robbing you of the opportunity to form a valuable partnership with experts who can help steer you in the right direction.Assumptions brought on by tunnel vision can cause founders to come on too strong in initial meetings with potential investors. Instead of charging in headfirst, use your self-assurance as a foundation for making a personal connection. The person you're meeting may have something you want, but you also have something they want in the form of a great investment opportunity. Take the blinders off and remember that investors need a reason to trust you, and at this stage in the game, a single-minded focus on your own value can send the wrong message.Ultimately, confidence is a good thing in the startup game. If even you don't believe in your startup's mission, you aren't going to get anywhere. But it's a mistake to let your confidence get in the way of your ability to advocate for your ideas and sell your startup to investors. Entering sales mode early and staying there will put you in a much better position for future success.

    "title": "The Difference Between Social Media Influencers and Brand Ambassadors",
    "content": "As the influence of social media personalities grow, how companies choose to advertise their products must innovate and grow as well. In this period of growth and development, two career tracks have developed: brand ambassadors and social media influencers. Although they often appear to be similar positions--and indeed, people can switch between being one and the other fairly quickly--they are two distinct positions with two distinct roles.If you're trying to follow the world of social media advertising, it's important to understand the key differences between the two.An ambassador has a contract with a company. They are obligated to support the company for a contracted period of time, and during that time are considered to be experts on the products, and must attend events and trade shows related to the product. How successfully they can advertise or sell a product is monetized; they are paid on a commission based on how successfully they can sell the product.Brand ambassadors are not necessarily going to be fans of the product they sell, but they are under contract and obligation to sell it, which means they often will go all out--including incorporating the product into their social media presence, sharing links to purchase, and often serving as a direct source one can buy a product from. Brand ambassadors are also locked into contracts that specify what they can and cannot endorse during the contract, but are free to endorse and work as an ambassador for different products, even competitors' products, after the contract ends.Social media influencers, on the other hand, will typically have a far different relationship with brands and companies. Instead of being contractually obligated to promote something, they will be given free goods, which companies hope will result in a positive review of their products and the ability to influence their fan base to also develop an interest in the product.They usually aren't guaranteed any monetary benefits for their decision to advocate for a company, and have more freedom and flexibility in what and how they promote something. They generally will feel freer to give an honest review--and will be willing to. Social media influencers are essentially the social media version of Amazon's Verified Purchase for Review program.Social media influencers are honing their own brand and image online even as they blog about products and companies they like, which means deception and fake advertising are viewed far more critically by social media influencers, who want to avoid misleading their audience.Ambassadors are contractually obligated to follow the company line and are given an explicit financial incentive for the company in exchange for labor. Social media influencers, on the other hand, are wooed and courted by companies who want positive access to the personality's supporters and followers. Companies have a preference for the free advertising power of social media influencers, but have more control over the content and advertising from a brand ambassador.Social media influencers can bring the company a well-selected advertising target demographic, and hold great sway thanks to their perceived honesty and openness. The reputation social media influencers have of not being bought, ironically, appeals to brand companies that want to take advantage of that loyalty.Because of the contracts, access to insider information, and guaranteed pay that comes with brand ambassadorships, influencers are constantly seeking ways to turn their relationships with businesses into brand ambassadorships. They like the consistent income and monetary benefits that come with ambassadorship programs, whereas companies may have a preference for the less-regulated influencer relationship, where free products can be seen as fair payment in exchange for labor.Which of the two you want to pursue, whether you're thinking about it from the perspective of a business or a social media personality, boils down to your interest in being locked into a contract with someone.",

    "title": "3 Expert Tips on Choosing the Best Location for Your Startup",
    "content": "Until very recently, entrepreneurs and startup founders were turning to San Francisco as the best location for starting up a new company. This is especially true with tech startups, mainly because there are already so many companies established in the area. Connecting with the best investors and gaining access to essential resources was relatively easy, making the whole process of setting up a new operation easy.Today, however, that approach is no longer used; newer startups are taking various aspects into consideration to determine the best location for their businesses. We talked to a number of experts and founders and found the best tips to keep in mind when choosing the best location for your startup.Employees remain a startup's most valuable asset in many situations. A strong team can make or break a startup in the early stages. After all, it takes a strong team to turn ideas into products that customers or users actually love.Fortunately, more places now offer access to amazing human resources. You don't even have to stick to big cities in the United States to find capable tech specialists to support your business ideas. Larger companies are starting to recruit experts from all around the world; you can take the opposite approach and set up your business close to where the best tech specialists are.There are several ways you can get a clearer picture of the available human resources in a particular area. Let's say you want to establish a business in the UK. You can take a closer look at the job market in cities like Norwich to learn more about the available talent.Cost is another factor to consider when trying to decide on a location for your startup. For conventional businesses, cost elements such as the cost of getting raw materials or supplies delivered to the premise are calculated before a business is established. For startups, there are two cost elements that are essential.The first one is operational cost. How much will it cost to set up a business and keep it running? How much do you need to spend on rent and other amenities? These costs will greatly affect your new business's bottom line, which is why they are worth considering.The second one is living cost. Your team members - and yourself - will have to live close to the office, making living cost an important factor to consider. Some cities are more affordable than others. Lower living costs also mean lower overheads for your business.Technology is on your side when it comes to getting connected to the right parties no matter where the business is based. You can still get in touch with the best investors. In fact, you can now connect with investors from Asia and Europe from anywhere in the world.That said, some cities offer support for local businesses through various regulations. The attention of city officials and the relationships you develop with local communities will also transform your business and increase its chances of success. Good networking along with the previous factors we've covered in this article will act as a strong foundation for your business.",
