    "content": "startup pitches. Company : Instasleep  Headquarters : Brooklyn, New York. Founding Team : Dr Robert Lee, Why we like it : According to statistics, one in three Americans don't get enough sleep. You might ask in our busy life what even is sleep, let alone enough sleep? In fact it is a necessary seven hours or more a day that takes us away from the concerns of our lives and lets our dreams flourish. Now it actually sounds pretty important. However, these poor statistics aren't limited just to the US, this ratio is shared across, Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom, among other countries.\n So if life is tying you down a little too much, it might be a good idea to consider functioning methods to walk you along the right track... well let's say lie you still on the right path. Instasleep is a drug-free sleep aid formulated by physicians. It contains a unique combination of 5-HTP, GABA and Melatonin. While it may sound strange, this is no nasty tasting concoction. It's simply a non-addictive, quick-dissolving Mint Melt that pops into your mouth and does the trick. These acids and herbal supplements work together to naturally enhance sleep. 5-HTP promotes calm and deep sleep, GABA helps with relaxation and melatonin helps signal your body and mind to actually fall asleep. Going back to our trusty statistics for sleep time in the US, the mining industry shows to be one of the most affected industries with 41.6 per cent of workers getting insufficient sleep. In other industries the facts show that this includes 38 per cent of utility workers, 32 per cent of healthcare and social assistance workers and 30.3 per cent of retail workers. While some of these workers might truly be running low on time, at the very least they should have effective and quality sleep to get up and running the next day.  There's always methods to train your body to get efficient sleep -a dark room, consistent schedules, regular exposure to sunlight, regular exercise and relaxing activities prior to sleeping, but if you're not dedicating the time to these strategies, a helping hand might do the trick instead.

    "content": "A new group of early-stage social tech ventures has been awarded funding by Nominet Trust, a UK 'tech for good' funder. The funding will support the development of digital technology solutions to improve the lives of others, including wheelchair users; vulnerable people who need help navigating the legal system; stroke survivors; victims of stalking, and young asthma patients. Using a variety of leading-edge technologies, these innovators are tackling real-world social challenges and creating positive change. Eight social tech enterprises have been selected as the latest recipients of Nominet Trust's successful Social Tech Seed funding programme. The combined grant and support package will enable these ventures to demonstrate the potential of their social tech products and services, providing digital tech solutions to a variety of social challenges and having a positive impact on people's lives. Disrupt Disability, recognised in the 2016 NT100, changes the way wheelchairs are designed, manufactured and distributed - with a mission to help the 52 million people worldwide who do not have access to a wheelchair that meets their needs. Their approach has, at its heart, an online platform of open source wheelchair designs that enable people to access, create, and adapt components to reflect specific needs, producing wheelchairs that are affordable, modular and fully customisable. Developer Media Co-op's incident recording app has been designed to empower victims of stalking. Developed with victims, campaigners, police, public prosecutors and lawyers in Scotland, the app will transform the way victims log stalking incidents - increasing their sense of control and the chances of successful prosecutions. TapSOS Ltd has developed an app that provides a nonverbal method of contacting the emergency services. It works to help people whose ability to communicate is compromised, for example by hearing impairments, speech impediments, breathing difficulties, or who are victims of domestic violence. With TapSOS, they can call for help without needing to speak. In this seventh round of Social Tech Seed, Nominet Trust has awarded a total of PS374,763. Social Tech Seed is an open grant funding programme that offers entrepreneurial organisations early-stage investment to develop innovative projects harnessing the power of the internet and digital technologies to tackle social issues to improve lives. The programme supports projects tackling pressing social challenges such as the environment and sustainability, the justice system, education, employment and medicine. The eight organisations chosen will use the funding to develop their products and services further, demonstrating their social, user and financial value. The other successful ventures are : Corporation Pop has created Patient's Virtual Guide, a mobile app that demystifies the hospital process for younger patients, allowing them to explore what they can expect to happen to them in hospital through a fun and stimulating game, harnessing augmented reality and beacon technology. Neurofenix's Gameball Platform revolutionises rehabilitation therapy for stroke survivors through games and social networking. Tiny Medical Apps has developed Learnable - a gamified app to encourage teenagers to stick to their Personalised Asthma Action Plans. Mapmyhealth is helping diabetes patients understand, engage with and self-manage their condition using digital therapeutics. Just : Transcription is an automated speech-to-text service that produces fast, accurate and cost effective court transcripts, tackling the key barriers of accessibility and transparency of justice for the most vulnerable. Vicki Hearn, Director of Nominet Trust, said,\"The UK has a burgeoning social tech sector, but access to funding for start-ups at the very early stages of their development remains limited - yet this is crucial to enable social innovators to test their ideas and unlock the potential of digital tech to improve lives. \"Nominet Trust is proud to support these eight new ventures via our Social Tech Seed programme, which has been hugely successful in kick-starting dozens of similarly exciting new projects. We're looking forward to seeing how they develop.\"   ",

Founding Team : Four dashing Argentinians, CEO Gonzalo Rodriguez, CPO Andres Ballone, Co-Founder Pablo Capurro and Co-Founder Santiago Capurro. Why we like it : Everyone cares about education and everyone cares about children. Well there's really no choice with kids, they will rule over us when we're in a nursing home. So getting them on the right path is pretty important.\n Papumba develops and publishes education games for mobile devices, designed to help young children to develop cognitively while playing with educational applications. We can't deny that in our modern century once a baby is born their fingers are already trained to type on a keyboard and dial a number. So uniting technology with education is a logical combination.   Currently Papumba has seven different apps, six million downloads and 85,000 kids playing everyday. It's doing pretty well. It offers games ranging from animal lessons to the alphabet to basic vocabulary to numbers. Each game app uses various techniques of song, dance, colours, voice and other fun strategies to motivate the kid to keep learning in this critical stage of their life. Their most recent educational app, Animal World helps babies and toddlers learn about the exotic animal tribes around the world. Players can explore the sounds and characteristics of more than 80 animals from the jungle, to the ocean to farms and play trivia and match-it-mini games to really test their knowledge. Papumba's educational games are created using guidance from childhood experts and the most important teachers themselves, the child's parents. Improvements are made based on comments and feedback Papumba receives to meet the needs of both parent and child. For children, playing should be a full time job and with Papumba they might actually be working harder than you.   ",

Why we like it : Ten web pages later and the marketing officer is sick of applying Search Engine Optimisation techniques onto each page. Pass the job onto the newest intern, who really only stuck it through to make a good first impression.\n E-commerce sites and large companies with numerous webpages on their site don't have the time to optimise each webpage to boost it onto the first page of google. Yet ideally that's exactly what they want, to market their service. Without eliminating the human empathy, large sites need tools to scale personal work across numerous pages and keep the marketer in control. This is exactly what Ranksense, an SEO automation platform for e-commerce sites, does. They are launching a machine-assisted SEO tool to help companies increase search rankings, scale and accelerate technical implementations, create compelling search snippets, conduct SEO experiments and measure SEO ROI. Sounds like they do a lot. Well translated into human time, it is. In machine time, not so much. Talking about time, using a machine to replace the human workload doesn't mean that the marketer is now without a job. Instead, they have more time to focus on other tasks. Effective SEO comes down to Return on Investment -ROI. You would think that a human would be the only one able to assess what techniques are actually working. However, with the help of Ranksense, a business can gain insights and learn which optimisation strategies are actually working. A machine can analyse what words are matching up with the company's preferred audience's searches to see exactly where to place their brand.  The team at Ranksense says, \"We know there's a large number of companies trying to meet client expectations and increase online traffic. We're not here to compete but to help out the industry with innovative machine technology.\" If you're still not convinced, here's one little detail to tip you over the edge - according to Ranksense's clients, traffic has grown 46 percent year over year and revenue increase 84 percent.

Similarly, the documentation service that Wonder.Legal provides is both cheaper than traditional legal services, and more reliable than free templates that are also available online. It is for this reason that Wonder.Legal has enjoyed such success across the countries it currently serves.  In fact, in 2016, the company grew by an average 14 percent month over month.

Designed for later-stage companies, the Fiterator amplifies startup success to foster innovation in the $500 billion cable, broadband and wireless industry.  The three month, non-resident startup accelerator focuses on real customer deals and opens the door to 57 of the world's leading cable operators. UpRamp launched their first Fiterator program last fall, and after its first four teams saw so much success - the emerging tech companies now have 18 engagements with cable and broadband operators - UpRamp has set out on a mission to find more companies that could significantly impact the industry. \"This is all about connectivity. Technological advancements in the cable and broadband industry are moving at such a rapid pace, and it's important the innovation cycle continues to thrive,\" said UpRamp Managing Director Scott Brown. \"We're absolutely thrilled about our second search for emerging tech companies, and we can't wait to see what magic they create to push the industry forward.\" The Fiterator is limited to four-six companies per session; this sharp focus helps the accelerator to customize each team's experience to ensure success - that is, each company will graduate with one or more actual deals, PoC, Lol, pilot, or trial from global enterprise players in connectivity. The first half of the accelerator will focus on industry immersion, mentorship matching, and solution validation, and will then laser in on testing, negotiations, and closing deals. Participants will have access to tech and connectivity C-levels from big players like Comcast, Charter, Cox, and Virgin Media. UpRamp pays for all travel, lodging, meals, and entertainment associated with the program. While mentorship and networking opportunities can certainly advance companies, the Fiterator accelerator goes a step beyond to try and offer participants immediate value. The cohort will have direct access to UpRamp partner organizations' end users, mentors with honed cable and broadband industry experience, and investors who know the market, as well at the obstacles these companies are up against. \"Our ultimate goal is to connect startups and emerging tech companies to this powerful eco-system, in order to foster innovation and help the smaller companies flourish,\" said Lisa Schwab, Program Director at UpRamp. \"Based on the success we saw with Fiterator's last cohort, we have no doubt the companies selected will go on to seriously impact this industry.\" The selected teams will join UpRamp in Louisville, Colorado bi-weekly from August-November, as well as for one session in New York City, and another in Sunnyvale, California.  To be considered, companies must have more than $1.5 million in financing or sustainable revenue, and a working product or service that could be a big win for the global cable-broadband-wireless industry. Fiterator is looking for later stage companies in Machine Learning, AR/VR, Blockchain, IT Infrastructure, Network Management, Data/Analytics, HR/Education, CyberSecurity, the IoT, Smart Homes & Security, HealthTech, WiFi, Wireless, Optical Networking and Customer Experience. Applications close May 5th. Interested companies may apply here.   ",

Why we like it : Because when someone answers that in their spare time they check out the latest news in the fashion world before heading back to slog through files all day, something sounds off. Filing and fashion aren't on the same page, unless they're one of those amazing people who get a buzz from organizing all day everyday.\n Money doesn't control everything. Maybe just that fancy car, sophisticated bar and latest iPhone product. But believe it or not, millennials actually want an interesting job. If millennials don't like their job, productivity will drop. If productivity drops, things won't get done. If things aren't done, businesses won't make sales. If business don't make sales, they fail. And now no one has a job and no one makes money. Qubed connects millennial to the right career options most suited to who they are. Qubed's discovery programs inspire the next generation of talent to pursue a career path that aligns with their passions. These programs are formed from their partnership with globally recognised universities, industry experts and employers in fields such as sport, fashion, music, tech, design and media. Let's be specific. Qubed has partnered with the faculty of Columbia to created a sports industry essentials online certificate, featuring lessons from sports industry professionals from places such as the National Football League, Nike, National Hockey League etc.  Perhaps like the fashion-loving bored office worker, a career in fashion will align better with their passion. Even the world of rhyme agrees. Through Qubed's partnership with Parsons School of Design they provide a fashion industry essentials online certificate. The program is 100 percent online, self-paced and open access to any student who wants to explore the possibilities in the fashion industry within their busy schedule. This fashion industry essential program has five available courses taught by more than 20 instructors from leaders in the fashion industry. These courses help students gain insights into the fashion industry and if they really are a fashion lover they can be prepared for a successful future in fashion.  So before a millennial unenthusiastically applies for a new job in a business they could take down with them, it would be better to check in with personal passions and make sure they're exactly where you want to be.

The move will help bring better customer service and better experience for merchants, as well as offering state of the art Point of Sale (POS), e-commerce gateway, and terminal options. Tidal POS has all the great features of a traditional POS system but, at half the size and for a quarter of the price. Now, merchants can manage their inventory, employees and customers all from one interface. Built for small to medium size shops, stands, and local restaurants, there is no hassle and it's easy to use with competitive rates. Tidal POS also has a built in CRM with cloud dashboard to help manage inventory and sales reports. \"We're offering the small and medium businesses the data and functionality that is only available to the large businesses,\" said founder and CEO of Tidal Commerce, Drew Sementa, formerly CEO of Premier Payment Systems. \"Many companies don't realize the payment issues they need to consider when starting off and there are a number of hurdles they need to jump over.

This online sales system includes plugins that work with many e-commerce platforms and shopping carts. All data is fully encrypted with the latest security standards, before data is even sent to the gateway. The platform supports all of the latest technology, including Apple Pay and Android Pay, so that client customers can pay any way they like.

Tidal Commerce helps them take these payments quickly, easily and securely, boosting customer confidence and ensuring the success of these SMB enterprises, an integral part of the United States' economy. \"Our main difference is that we offer hardware, software, and the payment processing backend to our clients as a total value package, where competitors stick to offering plans that start low and become expensive,\" added Mark Spirek, co-founder and CEO of Impeccable Digital, now CTO of Tidal Commerce. \"They play the game where they claim they can save you money, only to raise rates later.

Why we like it : With snapchat as a popular hit for smartphone users, selfie sticks a common travel item and front facing cameras frequently used on mobile devices, it is clear we live in a photo-loving society. No, we're not talking about anything narcissistic. We're talking about maintaining physical memories -images we can refer to later down the track when the time that we rode our bike for the first day begins to blur.  \n But two decades ago, snapchat didn't exist, selfie sticks weren't popular and many people didn't think of using their phone to take a selfie. So then what? Recreate memories is an online service offering you the chance to make up for any memory blurring around the edge. You can recreate a memory that you've always held dear to you, but at that particular moment your thoughts weren't on taking a photo. Honestly, this is easier than it sounds. All you have to do is know the memory you want to create and put a rough time period on it. Select photos from this time period in your life containing the people you wish to include in this memory and along with an explanation of your memory, submit them to Recreate memories. The artists with Recreate will create a draft image of this moment and send it back for your approval. When you're happy, they'll whisk up the final result and you will have the image in your hands. So unless you're a superb artist yourself, it would only be for recreate memories that you could have a copy of this physical image. It can be difficult thinking up the perfect gift for a loved one. At the end of the day they're most likely content with your company. However, with Recreate you can give then a physical memory of a significant or happy moment you have both share in the past. Technically your gifting them your company in physical form. Not only can they relive this moment but they also receive a valuable gift. Yes, this is starting to sound pretty cheesy, but at the end of the day who doesn't like a bit of cheese every now and then.   ",

    "content": "Qwilr, the startup that turns boring, offline documents into beautiful web pages, has raised AUD$1.5m (USD$1.12m) from venture capital firm Point Nine. It is the global firm's first investment in an Australian company. Qwilr brings to business documents all the benefits of professional web development design, without the hassle or high costs. By utilising the web Qwilr Pages can be brought to life with everything from embedded videos, interactive charts and customer surveys, to more complex tasks like streamlined sales processes across Accept, E-Sign and Payments. While Qwilr makes creating beautiful work simple, the high-impact visuals of Qwilr Pages are supported by a powerful backend that provides detailed analytics (helping customers see who is viewing the document and what sections they care about), strong security, and integrations with tools that have become essential for many businesses, such as Salesforce, Slack and Xero. Quite simply, Qwilr helps you do business better and look good doing it. For Point Nine, the VC firm behind SaaS startup heavyweights Zendesk, Typeform and Unbounce, to invest in Qwilr is a testament to what the team has achieved in such a short time. The firm's co-founder and Managing Partner, Christoph Janz, is set to join Qwilr's board. \"Twenty-five years ago, the default format for sales proposals and many other documents was still paper. Over the last 20 years or so, Word, Powerpoint and PDF documents became the new standard. I'm pretty sure that in the next 10 years there will be another paradigm shift. We're confident that Qwilr can play a key role in building the document of the future and we're thrilled to be partners on that journey,\" Janz said. Since raising its first AUD$500,000 from the Sydney Seed Fund and Macdoch Ventures in 2015, Qwilr has grown swiftly -- tripling its team, opening a US office, and growing revenue 45 times over. To date, there have been more than 200,000 Qwilr Pages created. Qwilr is used by over 40,000 businesses (everyone from Zillow to Colliers) in more than 80 countries, and it has helped customers generate over a quarter of a billion dollars in accepted quotes on the platform.

    "title": "Qurious launches new AI platform to boost sales teams and speed up onboarding",
    "content": "Qurious, a startup that boosts sales teams' performance by improving the quality of conversations, is marking its official launch. The platform learns directly from teams' highest performing members and provides real-time battlecards during calls to help close deals. Qurious shows real-time battlecards in response to customer's questions and objections while a sales call is happening. The AI platform leverages real-time speech recognition, dialogue management, and integrates with CRM, soft-phones, dialers and web conferencing. Qurious models the back and forth of the conversation, analyzing what's being said and how it's said. When Qurious detects a trigger during a phone call, such as a buying signal or objection from the customer, it shows a contextually relevant battlecard to the salesperson to help guide the conversation as it's happening. If a salesperson is rambling, for example, Qurious nudges the salesperson to stop talking and ask a question. \"We recognized the need for this product as we began our career selling natural language processing software into enterprises,\" said Sabrina Atienza, Qurious' CEO and co-founder. \"Selling was hard. It's difficult to remember exactly what to say and when; there's no way to track what works. We have seen many startups collapse due to failure to scale sales cost-effectively. We wanted to create real-time voice A.I. to help salespeople ramp faster, win more deals, and be able to iterate on what's actually working.\" Qurious is solving how to scale revenue cost-effectively, reducing training time to weeks and boosting top-line revenue. With today's approaches, it is very difficult to make training stick. Companies create scripts or playbooks, but they're outdated as soon as they're created. Also, they're hard to use when you're on the phone with a customer because you have to search the document to find what to say. Qurious applies real-time voice Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help every salesperson leverage proven best practices on every call. Each battlecard is tracked and linked to outcomes, so teams can see what's actually working and A/B test different battlecards. Additionally, for small or new sales teams, the platform offers best practice templates so your team can use something that has been proven to work. \"Playbooks are painful to build and very tedious to maintain,\" explained co-founder and CTO George Ramonov. \"By continuously analyzing your customer's questions and which responses are most effective, we give sales teams real-time content development. If a new question comes up, Qurious adds a battlecard to your playbook, so your playbooks evolve with your GTM strategy and are always effective.\" For businesses, sales training is a money blackhole. In 2015, almost $2.5 billion was spent, globally, on sales training. While this is no doubt a hefty sum, the rate at which this training is forgotten is phenomenal. Within 30 days of sales training - at a conference, for example - 79 percent of what was taught is forgotten. Since almost 1 in 8 full-time workers in the US are sales professionals, this problem is massive. Qurious fixes this problem by providing on-the-go, real-time battlecards for sales teams on every single call, powered by voice A.I. Atienza added, \"By improving the quality of conversations with buyers, we improve sales productivity and effectiveness for sellers, including their profit margins and growth rates.\"   ",

Why we like it : Because trapping your team members together in a closed room sounds fun... especially as the powerful CEO. That is until your team members drag you in with them.  \n Team work can really make or break a business. If the team meshes well and collectively believes in their work, so does the service and product. But you also want to be having fun. All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy. So do something fun innovative with the team. Reason embeds game mechanics and advanced technology to create innovative team-bonding activities. We're not talking about simple online games, chats or puzzles. We're already in the second decade of the 21st century. It's time to bring about full blown rooms packed with interactive puzzles, virtual reality engagement, robotic confrontations. They have over 50,000 startups in their network with AI, Robotics, IOT, Drones, HCI and VR. Yep they've got the tech gear in line. Bringing your business team to Reason, not only forces participation with up and coming tech but with each other. Surely not everyone can be a whizz at all these gadgets. Reason has an activity they've called the Escape Room. This is a real life adventure in which players are trapped inside a room, with nothing but what they are given to figure out a way to escape. Let's give you visuals. Imagine a giant reactor. Something like a closed cylindrical room, gadgets lining the walls, blue lights illuminating your vision and screens talking tech to you. But something's gone wrong. What are you suppose to do? The only help you can find is from your teammates and the top-notch tech scattered around the room. Within two hours you need to discover the clues, make observations and recognise patterns to shutdown the reactor in time and escape before the whole thing explodes. If time pressure, innovative gadgets, forced communication and hand ons work doesn't get the blood pumping and the conversations flowing, then well, maybe more than just the reactor is going to explode.

    "content": "Austin-based startup Snaplitics, Inc. today launched the Snaplitics Website Builder. The Snaplitics digital toolkit offers an affordable tool for creating professional websites and landing pages without having to hire developers. \"A professional website that looks less than 3 years old and tells a story is a crucial component of a business's success,\" said co-founder Sean Hynes. \"We wanted to make the process widely approachable to even non-tech-savvy users without inflated, never-ending developer fees.\"  Hynes and co-founder Mykola Bashlakov said it was their mission to provide a website builder that is five times faster and provides a reliably advanced alternative to prohibitively limited mainstream website creation tools. Snaplitics was launched based on the idea that the future of website construction is with easy-to-use website builders. As a web developer, Hynes experienced this firsthand when he was losing business to WordPress and their peer website builders. However, Hynes' personal experiments with these builders proved to be incredibly limiting. He did not like being boxed in by static templates, unintuitive user interfaces, tedious hand coding, security holes, and loss of data ownership in services like Google Analytics.  Hynes explained why he wanted to build Snaplitics, \"I wanted to help business owners, employees, bloggers, and casual web users with all levels of technical experience to modernize their dinosaur websites and help them launch a successful business on the web.\" Users can build their website with an intuitive row and column level drag-and-drop interface that is not restricted to a template. Innovative features like SnapStats analytics provide detailed, real-time data about customers, heat maps and more. Additionally, Snaplitics is equipped with powerful marketing software that includes lead capture pop-ups, integrated landing pages, and social media sharing.   ",

    "content": "startup pitches. Company : Hire.Bid. Headquarters : Washington DC  Founding Team : Founder and CEO, Neil Sandhu. Why we like it : Because it's an auction! Better prices, good bargains, plenty of options, fair play and the slight thrill of competition. What's not to like?  Okay, maybe sitting at your computing betting on the service of a professional isn't as thrilling as shouting out your bidding price in front of tens of people. Behind your screen there's no pompous bidder eyeing you down. You're the one in charge. You can quickly scroll through your options and pick out the best fit for your needs. Hire.Bid is an online marketplace connecting professionals with clients. Experienced professionals can auction off their available time to be bid on potential clients. When business get busy, companies lose talent and there's extra work to be done, they can search through Hire.Bid for the ideal professional. It works for both parties. On the one side, a company finds a new worker. Yes we get it, it's always a risk taking on new workers. Do they understand your business? Do they share your vision? Do they get your culture? Are you on the same path? However, Hire.Bid has a unique system that helps companies test drive professionals with short time blocks of work, rather than long-term commitment. Later down the track if it all works out, a client could potentially hire the professional for additional services or simply bid them adieu and search for a better fit. On the other side of the spectrum, if you have a few extra hours, have professional skills and are looking to further your experience, there's no harm in trying. None at all actually. Not to your pocket and not to your time. It's quick and free to post your professional profile and time blocks on the marketplace. Then all you need to do is wait to be hired. Hire.Bid charges a low commission only from the fees paid by a client to a professional on the marketplace. No job, no fees.  We know, the internet can be a little risky. Who knows who is on the other end. Apart from short term working blocks, Hire.Bid has a unique rating system that informs the client the level of service they are to expect from a professional in terms of their price value per hour.

Why we like it : If you're still amazing by 3D, you're very behind. If you've been to a 4D cinema, you're only just starting to understand. The next generation is growing up expecting complete immersion into a fictional scene - welcome to Virtual Reality.\n It's an escape from work, an escape from stress and an escape from the shouts of the angry neighbour next door. Literally from your couch you can be virtually transported into another reality. Warducks is one of the guys who know where the entertainment business is heading. They build fun and innovative virtual reality games and experiences. You will be transported somewhere else, well at least convinced that you're no longer on your couch. With specialised headsets, realistic images and a sense of your own physical presence within the virtual environment, it is pretty convincing.   One of Warducks latest games, Sneaky Bears, for mobile VR and takes you through an abandoned building, throwing teddy bears your way. They're not there for a cuddle but rather you have to keep your head turning and your eyes peeled to check out all directions. If you don't shoot down the bears before they scratch out your eyes and blur your vision, that's game over. Pretty intense huh. If you keep an eye out on WarDuck's brand, you might catch the release of their next VR adventure, a meditative experience. This is exactly what virtual reality should be doing. You will step outside of your world and be rid of your day to day stress. Not as intense as a fight against teddy bears but enough to transport you to another realm. They have more and it's up to you to move past your amazement of 4D and join the magic of the 21st century. One of their more popular games, particularly in the US and Brazil is a Facebook and mobile hidden object game called Global Agents, which is worth checking out.   ",

According to the provider of development and deployment technologies, this acquisition is a key part of Progress' strategy to provide the best platform to build and deliver cognitive-first applications. DataRPM offers an award-winning cognitive predictive maintenance solution for industrial IoT. The patented platform automates predictive modeling, leveraging proprietary Meta Learning capabilities to increase quality, accuracy and timeliness of equipment failure predictions, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in savings. The technology enables customers such as Jaguar, Samsung and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to predict and prevent asset failures, and increase yield and efficiencies to generate outcomes for IIoT. As data continues to explode, driven by machine-generated and human-generated data, and devices and digital touchpoints proliferate rapidly, organizations must leverage cognitive-first applications for business benefit to compete and win. \"Progress has always provided the platform for building and deploying mission-critical business applications. The future of applications is cognitive-first, and Progress is committed to providing the best platform to build and deploy them,\" said Yogesh Gupta, CEO, Progress. \"Our customers and partners already use many of the key product capabilities from Progress necessary for this approach- front-end application development tooling, mobility, back end application services, and data connectivity. With the acquisition of DataRPM, we now have leading predictive analytics capabilities to round out our cognitive apps platform.\" With the acquisition of DataRPM, Progress enables customers to harness previously untapped volumes of data to build cognitive apps quickly and easily - democratizing machine learning and making it accessible to any organization. DataRPM technology detects random and unknown failures using a combination of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques, saving businesses hundreds of millions of dollars by preventing failures of critical assets and maximizing quality and efficiency. This solves the huge data science talent crunch by teaching machines to automate data science using a technique called Meta Learning, that learns from experience and feedback, saving industrial companies from having to invest in large armies of data scientists. DataRPM will continue to offer its leading solution for cognitive predictive maintenance for IIoT under the Progress umbrella, supported by an increase in investment and resources. Integration of DataRPM technologies and Progress products is already underway and the updated offerings are expected to be available to early-adopter partners and customers later this year. \"Progress' strategy around cognitive applications is in perfect alignment with our vision, which is why the acquisition was the right move for us,\" said Sundeep Sanghavi, co-founder and CEO, DataRPM. \"It will enable us to increase investment in our current cognitive predictive maintenance offering while also becoming an essential part of a ground-breaking platform for building cognitive applications across multiple markets.\"   ",

Emoticast, which is behind the TuneMoji apps and bots that puts music GIFs with sound into messaging, expands the ways mobile users can send entertainment content across the world's biggest messaging platforms. Emoticast already has global licenses with such major music industry labels as Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group, and with major publishing groups, including Sony ATV, Warner Chappell Music, Universal Publishing Group, Sony BMG Music Entertainment and PRS/Impel. The company is also widening its focus on entertainment messaging content beyond music gifs to film and television. For the first time, users of the world's biggest messaging platforms, including iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Kik, can \"Say it with a song\" through TuneMoji. The company enables mobile users to send snackable music GIFs with sound from today's top artists and has produced original content working directly with Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran and many others. The company will use the investment to continue to grow its partners in music and other entertainment fields, to increase original content collaborations with artists, and to expand its messaging partner network. Emoticast was founded by music industry serial entrepreneur James Fabricant, former head of MySpace Europe. With deep experience across the social media and music industries, Emoticast has secured the global rights to one of the most extensive collections of songs and original artist content available. \"At Warner Music, we are excited about new, innovative opportunities to integrate music into social and messaging platforms and to adapt our content to evolving consumer behavior,\" said Ole Olberman, chief digital officer and executive VP for Warner. \"By partnering with Emoticast we enable our music to enrich billions of daily messaging interactions and we create new avenues for value creation and unique marketing for our artists and songwriters.\" \"We're delighted to welcome such rock star investors to Emoticast,\" added Emoticast founder and CEO James Fabricant. \"Emoticast is primed to become the micro-YouTube for messaging built on a foundation of premium licensed content.

    "content": "ShapeShift, the world's leading instant exchange for Bitcoin digital currency and other blockchain assets, today announced the completion of its $10.4m Series A funding round. Led by Berlin-based Earlybird, the financing is the largest ever for a non-fiat financial exchange.  Other new investors include Lakestar, Access Venture Partners, Pantera Capital, and Blockchain Capital. Prior ShapeShift backers FundersClub, Digital Currency Group and Erik Voorhees, the company's founder and CEO, also participated. The funds will be mainly used for further expansion of the team to keep up with its rapid growth, and to release two groundbreaking exchange products in 2017. With the market cap of blockchain tokens now in the tens of billions of dollars, ShapeShift helps customers convert between them. The digital asset exchange has grown an average of 48 percent per month since launching just under three years ago. The company operates under a strict \"no fiat\" policy, meaning only legitimate blockchain-based assets are permitted on the platform. \"ShapeShift's team built a compelling crypto exchange engine which can be easily integrated into third-party products given its unique trustless design,\" said Christian Nagel, partner at Earlybird. \"It is uncommon to find the powerful combination of a noted serial Bitcoin entrepreneur, a senior team with deep industry knowledge, and a strong vision as the one present at ShapeShift.\" Founded in mid-2014, ShapeShift is the fastest and safest way for both humans and machines - such as trading bots and IoT devices - to exchange any asset that exists on a public blockchain. The company pioneered the concept of \"protection by design,\" building the first exchange that didn't require the exposure of sensitive customer data. Unlike other exchanges, ShapeShift doesn't hold customer assets or information, a feature that is impossible in traditional finance. This sets a new standard in consumer protection that the largest banks haven't been able to achieve in a hundred years. \"When we started ShapeShift, a future world of natively digital assets was very theoretical,\" said Erik Voorhees, founder and CEO of ShapeShift. \"Yet this world is quickly arriving; one in which millions of forms of digital value, from access keys to tokenized derivative contracts to video game items, will trade between people and machines all over the world, every second of every day. Just as information has gone natively digital, so too now goes value. Bitcoin taught a skeptical world how to do it, and the gold rush is on.\" The ShapeShift platform currently supports more than 40 leading digital currencies and assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, Augur's Rep token, and Monero. Any of these assets may be sold for any other, thus over 1,080 direct trading pairs are supported, more than any other blockchain-based exchange. \"Pantera believes in a future where myriads of digital assets will facilitate innovative use cases and products,\" said Paul Veradittakit, partner at Pantera. \"ShapeShift has done a tremendous job providing a seamless way to exchange such assets, and is spearheading this vision with upcoming financial products.  Most importantly, we invested in ShapeShift because of our confidence in Erik, whom we've known for a while and has demonstrated the leadership and qualities to succeed in this space.\"   ",

    "title": "Three perspectives on Canada's thriving startup ecosystem",
    "content": "The burgeoning startup ecosystem in Canada is recently gaining a flurry of mainstream attention and more and more eyes seem to be on the country's hospitable environment for entrepreneurs. In 2016, over $3 billion in Canadian venture capital deals were made, according to the Canadian Venture Capital & Private Equity Association. This momentum doesn't appear to be stopping anytime soon, according to some industry players. Here are their takes on what's fueling Canada's startup industry. Ottawa-based Klipfolio is a SaaS analytics dashboards tool with customers in over 120 countries. The company has raised $19.6M in venture funding to date.  Allan Wille, Klipfolio President and CEO, bootstrapped the company for several years and had thought that being acquired by a company south of the border was an inevitability.  \"Five, six, seven years ago, I would have thought that an exit will come through an acquisition, and it will most likely happen with a US company.\" Wille points to Canadian startups like Hootsuite and Vision Critical that have \"resisted that early exit to a foreign company.\" \"I think there's more of a 'we can do it here, all the way attitude.'\" Wille says that Canada's strong talent pool and the foreign exchange market have caught the attention of US companies and investors. \"We have started getting calls from US companies and recruiters to hire Canadians, but not move them to the States. They want to hire Canadians and keep them in Canada, because the salary, especially compared to the foreign exchange market, is way less expensive. I think we're recognizing that there's a talent pool and a hiring pool here that we can benefit from, and I think US investors are realizing that as well.\" Wille also points to Canada's tax credits that benefit early stage organizations investing in R&D projects and talent. As the General Partner of Real Ventures, a leading seed stage fund in Canada, Janet Bannister noted she continues to see the quality of Canadian entrepreneurs increase significantly year after year. \"I'm thrilled with what we're seeing in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, right across the country. And I think of it of something like a snowball effect.  If you have a strong entrepreneur building a great company, it encourages other young entrepreneurs. It also trains a whole group of people.\" \"Those people will someday leave Shopify and start their own company or join another fast-growing company, and take the skills and expertise that they learnt.\" Shopify COO Harley Finkelstein was recognized as 'Angel Investor of the Year' at this year's Canadian Startup Awards. In a statement, Finkelstein expressed that his role at Shopify has enabled him to invest in emerging Canadian startups. Shopify's leaders may also endeavour to keep their M&A activity domestic, as four out of five of the companies they have acquired are Canada-based. Leo Lax, currently the Executive Managing Director of SaaS Accelerator L-SPARK [disclosure : I work for L-SPARK] has witnessed various segments in Canadian tech rise and fall. His career spans decades and it includes various roles within telecommunications companies in Ottawa. The city was widely known as Canada's epicentre of telecom development until the industry grinded to a halt in the early 2000s.  Recently the region has transitioned to gaining recognition for thriving software firms and autonomous vehicle technology development.  Lax credits cities being known for a particular innovation as being critical to creating centres for entrepreneurial excellence. \"Canada has a number of strong clusters, and those clusters have enabled certain regions to excel.\" Typically the region boasts a global anchor company that lends itself to attracting like-mind companies and enables it to become a \"rich and fertile place for entrepreneurs.\" Lucy Screnci has written about tech, business and startups for the Ottawa Business Journal, Techopia and Techvibes.com. She is currently the editor for Voice of the North and is Digital Content Manager at L-SPARK, Canada's SaaS Accelerator. ",

    "content": "PermitZone provides a powerful, building permit search tool for anyone who needs information about building permits. Simply enter the address where construction work will be performed, and the platform will pinpoint the corresponding building department and provide contact information free of charge. Users can also upload plans and pull permits online by filling out a short application which PermitZone reviews for errors and submits on your behalf, even if local authorities don't make it available online. \"At PermitZone we believe that permit information and requirements should be made uniformly accessible and the process of getting a permit should be easier and quicker for contractors and do-it-yourself pros,\" says PermitZone founder and CEO Ray Antonino. \"We are democratizing the process of searching and obtaining permits, helping builders and DIY enthusiasts in turn.\" PermitZone has built a lookup tool that correctly identifies the building department assigned to any address and provides free access to contact information of the right municipal authorities. Similarly, only 12 percent of the USA's 19,000+ building departments offer the chance to obtain a construction permit online. This is a huge hassle. PermitZone allows users to complete a standardized permit application for all of their permit needs. PermitZone then works with the building department to get the permits 'pulled' and customers receive automated communications throughout the process. Each year, more than 30 million building permits are 'pulled' or granted by building departments across the US. While common costs for permit expeditors can hit as much as $2000, PermitZone charges just $49 per permit application. PermitZone provides permitting data that is available before a project is completed or even approved. The platform can even inform companies using sub contractors if a permit is needed, if one has been issued and when a permit has successfully closed out with the building department. PermitZone also helps municipalities to get online without having to sign up to costly contracts. The platform provides a solution for municipalities that want to offer online permitting without disrupting existing workflows while simultaneously providing contractors with uniformed access to permit information and the ability to pull construction permits online using a standard application for all the places they service. \"We will change the way people pull permits and make the process more efficient for all involved,\" Antonino continues. \"We have the passion, and the nous, behind us to do it. We want to make permit applications quicker and easier than ever before, in order to put an end to drawn out and costly planning processes.\"   ",

    "content": "Universite de Quebec a Montreal (UQAM) and its School of Management (ESG UQAM), Tourisme Montreal and the City of Montreal have launched MT Lab, an incubator dedicated for tourism, culture and entertainment startups.  A joining of academic, entrepreneurial and municipal sectors, MT Lab has a mission to host fledgling entrepreneurs from Quebec, Canada and abroad in the tourism, transport, festivals, culture, hotel, restaurant and entertainment sectors. MT Lab plans to host its first cohort of approximately eight to 10 start-ups in various fields : technology, digital technology, artificial intelligence, fintech, virtual/augmented reality, new services, linked objects, usage innovation, collaborative and sustainable economy, etc. MT Lab is possible due to a financial contribution of $200,000 from the City of Montreal, originating from the Fonds de developpement des territoires, a program of the Ministere des Affaires municipales et de l'Occupation du territoire. Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, said, \"Montreal is a catalyst for entrepreneurial strengths, and the start-up ecosystem makes a significant contribution to the city's economic activity. The MT Lab initiative participates in the sector's burgeoning activity, while reinforcing Montreal's draw by building on the innovative energy of young entrepreneurs. The incubator is part of our development strategy for an increasingly innovative and successful metropolis.\" Tourism is a real economic engine in Montreal and Quebec, and MT Lab is helping to reinvent it, due in part to its partnership with Paris's tourism incubator, Welcome City Lab. Yves Lalumiere, president and CEO of Tourisme Montreal, added, \"One sure way to increase the number of tourists in our city and the quality of their experience is to increase and diversify the tourism offer. MT Lab will undoubtedly contribute to the reinvention of our offer with a view to positioning Montreal at the top of the list of cities to visit.\" MT Lab will be located at UQAM, in the heart of the entertainment district, in the Pierre-Dansereau Science Complex. The incubator will offer start-ups a set of services, including conference areas, an open space for coworking with open access and mentoring. \"A fine example of a university contribution to the vitality of its community, MT Lab will make the advanced expertise of UQAM and its School of Management available to start-ups, to foster innovation in key sectors of the Montreal economy,\" said UQAM rector, Robert Proulx. The start-ups supported by MT Lab will benefit from an environment dedicated to entrepreneurship as well as tourism and innovation observatories, in addition to privileged access to the business networks of several incubator partners, who will be announced shortly. \"ESG has placed entrepreneurship at the heart of its mission. This tourism enterprise incubator will play a role in the development of Quebec's economy to which ESG is proud to contribute,\" added Stephane Pallage, dean of ESG UQAM. The call for applications from young businesses is currently underway and will run until May 5.   ",

    "title": "The benefits of hanging out your washing in public: Three lesser known facts about customer reviews",
    "content": "Many SMB owners gave a knowing smile when the South Park episode \"You're not Yelping\" aired. In the episode local businesses are terrorized when over-zealous citizens all become critics on review site Yelp, and try to use it to their advantage. While the episode portrayed digital reviews in a classic tongue in cheek fashion, it does raise some interesting points about just how important client reviews are for modern businesses.  Back in the pre-internet era, client reviews were left on pieces of paper in suggestion boxes, or told directly to managers, allowing businesses to craftily censor the information they then re-shared in the public sphere. However, now in the transparent modern age of digital media, businesses have lost the power to 'sweep things under the rug', and run the constant risk of having their dirty washing aired in public if customers are dissatisfied with any aspect of their service. But in a more positive light, if your business is doing things right, for every bad review, there should be multiple good ones. Recent studies show more than 70% of consumers say positive reviews make them trust a business more, and more than 30% said they are likely to spend more at a business with excellent reviews. Here are three things that businesses might not know about public reviews, which they can use to their advantage : Think back to important decisions you have made in your life. Buying your first car, choosing the college you were going to apply to, or choosing a wedding venue. The chances are that you didn't jump straight into these decisions without first running them past someone else first. You looked to contacts who you trust for personal recommendations and referrals, to save yourself from ill advised and costly hastily made decisions. Considering social media, and chat platforms like Whatsapp now make it easier than ever to communicate, many businesses assume that they can rest on their laurels, relying on their engaged community of customers to pass on the good news to friends and family. However, it is more important than ever to make sure reviews are available online, as potential customers are likely to bypass personal contacts, instead placing their trust in the online community. According to BrightLocal, nearly 90% percent of consumers trust online reviews as much as a personal recommendation, even though they are posted by complete strangers. In the modern digital age the quantity and quality of the reviews you receive can have a massive and direct impact on your company's bottom line. According to an infographic from invesp 90% of consumers interviewed said they read at least one online review before trusting a business, and 86% said they would hesitate to use a business which has negative reviews. And even if you receive some low reviews, it's always better to share, as recent studies show even 1 star reviews have a 107% better conversion rate than no-reviews products. Considering that the internet - and thus search engines - are now the main discovery tool for choosing businesses, SEO is becoming increasingly important for all companies regardless of whether they trade online or not. Enabling customer reviews on your site can have a positive effect on your company's organic search rankings. According to MOZ's Local Search Ranking Factors Survey, online reviews account for 10% of how Google and other search engines decide to rank search results. With each new review written, the amount of unique content on your site increases. For Google's algorithms this means you'll be seen as having higher authority, more relevance, and, as such, a higher chance of getting those pages ranked higher on search engines.  If that weren't enough, there's actually a way to microformat the reviews on your site so Google can index them directly as \"rich answers\" for user queries. Ostensibly, this would allow a review of your product to be featured above the fold of normal search results for specific queries, dramatically amplifying your search visibility. This is especially important for network effect businesses, which grow in strength as they bring on more users - think AliBaba, Ebay, Lyft and Groupon. Reviews accelerate growth, and growth compounds over time, so if discrepancies in user bases grow too much over time this can effectively make less popular sites irrelevant. If the South Park episode is anything to go by, it would appear that consumers are reviewing for their own personal enjoyment. However, a deeper look into the psyche of the consumer shows that 70% review because they want a response from your business. A common mistake is expecting clients to leave reviews without any prompting. But it is up to businesses to encourage users to share their opinions. Some tactics include creating handouts which provide clear instructions on how to leave reviews on specific sites. This is especially useful for older demographics who are less tech savvy. Other suggestions include linking to review sites on your website and social media pages, training staff to encourage on the spot reviews, and requesting a 'Find us on Yelp' sticker for your business. Another option is to create customer incentives to increase reviews. Some local search directories allow you to share coupons and discounts on their sites, and Facebook includes a function which allows you to share special offers for reviewers and fans. You could also advertise special deals or discounts in store for people who show a review they have left - regardless of whether it is flattering or not.  For businesses, reviews are a means of ironing out the bumps and improving service. So instead of living in fear of a malicious or scathing review, encourage your customers to give as much feedback as possible, to their benefit and your own.

    "content": "startup pitches. Company : Everypixel. Headquarters : Chelyabinsk, Russia. Founding Team : A leading employer in the Stock Photography Industry since 2006, Dmitry Shironosov. Why we like it : Because we're visual creatures. And we're also very busy creatures. We're only going to stop and check out something if it really catches our attention.\n Well then, when you want to market or promote a product, the solution seems easy right? Find something eye-catchy. A quick five minute scroll through a stock image site. But that's easier said than done. Many stock image banks online overlap and it's hard work to find a rare or fashioned stock photo. If you want to stand out, you have to do better than that. Everypixel is an image search engine that is beta-testing a special aesthetic filter. They have worked on a neural network to create an aesthetics detection algorithm that can see the beauty in photos the same way humans do. With this neat trick all the trashy stock images that designers and photo editors are forced to scroll through to reach a quality image, disappear from this search engine. Poof. Less time wasted. More time well spent. A quality picture found and the attention of more people caught. There's one awesome fact we just have to emphasise : \"It can see the beauty in photos the same way humans do!\" Technology never fails to surprise. The team at Everypixel asked designers, editors and experienced stock photographers to help them to generate a training dataset as an example. They tested 956,794 positive and negative patterns (it's science, we have to be specific) and programed the algorithm to see the beauty of images in the same way as us. If you want to see how good your visual choices really are, you can try out their aesthetics detection algorithm for yourself here, by uploading an image to see how it ranks. The final aim of the algorithm will be to rank each photo in the Everypixel search engine and move it closer to the first search page based on its rank. It will also regularly renew search results to meet recent trends and minimise the large photo base microstock agencies accumulate.   ",

    "content": "startup pitches. Company : GoLocalApps. Headquarters : Sacramento, California. Founding Team : The awesome team of GoLocalApps, with CEO, Heidi Komlofske, techy, Ross Rojek and programmer, Casey. Why we like it. Designing an app could not be easier... or could it? Apparently - according to GoLocalApp - yes, yes it could be. Much easier, in fact.  If you're not a guy in glasses, in a simple t-shirt and with an over-the-shoulder computer bag - yep, your stereotypical tech wiz - then getting onto AppToolKit, from GoLocalApp, would give you plenty of time to get to your Friday night drinks and Sunday family day.  AppToolKit, is a program that lets app developers track and share their app reviews, create smart websites for their apps, and create screenshots for app stores. It's been created for the non tech guys, both in marketing and developing who want to manage their apps quickly and easily from the one place. Fun fact -there's more than two million apps on the market and more than a million app developers. Not so fun after all. Realistically, this makes your competition pretty strong. But you shouldn't let that deter you. If you have a brilliant, app-worthy idea that will save the world (or maybe just your local community) it should be on the market.  Now you might be thinking, since there's so many app developers out there, surely there's a better app you can download to help your cause, right? Wrong. Although there are many apps that allow users to monitor reviews or create screenshots for app stores or app landing pages, no one product does all of it in one place.  Who doesn't judge a book by its cover? If the book cover is your incentive to open the book, the screenshot is your doorway into the app. When you're giving an app 30 seconds of your time, then you're going to be judgemental at first glance. With AppToolKit's Screenshot Builder you can draw your users in with an inviting capture of what you're all about. And you're not just limited to portrait scaped views, horizontal screenshots can be added as well. Apparently at the moment, AppToolKit is the only app that lets you do this.    ",

    "content": "If you're a designer and you want to stay up to date on the latest in the design industry, you could follow up-and-coming designers such as Seb Lester and Daniel Aristizabal or attend meetups like Design Driven NYC and SF Design. However, one of the best ways to remain current in the design space is by reading top design blogs. Yet knowing who to follow differs based on intent. For businesses, it's essential to follow blogs that lend value from a company perspective. Regardless of the specific industry, every company is a design company. That is, every company should value design. Whether it's delivering a spectacular user interface UI on a website or nailing that logo, design is crucial to business. Often finding these sites and differentiating them may be difficult. Aspects like logo design, branding, and marketing are key. Here are the design blogs your business needs to follow : The Logo Company, as the name suggests, specializes in logos. Their blog features niche topics - from posts on marketing and branding for cleaning companies, charities, and churches, to insights into how to design your own logo. The Logo Company blog is chock full of stellar technical tips, such as how to use gradients for blending colors and how to work with a professional graphic designer. This blog is a great read from a business and design perspective. The Logo Company blog provides a solid foundation of industry specific knowledge, as well as best practices. One of the highlight articles delves into what makes a good logo. The secret sauce : versatility. This piece analyzes the designs of the Nike Swoosh, UPS Shield, and McDonald's Golden Arches. Branding, Packaging & Opinion is an excellent blog for business design. Focusing predominantly on logos and packaging, BP&O not only highlights specific examples, but goes a step further by offering reviews. Freelance writer and designer Richard Baird runs BP&O and wonderfully balances opinion with evidence. For instance, in a piece on minimal brand identity design, Baird explains that \"The work featured is reductive but well-intentioned, aesthetically restrained and communicatively precise. These often rely on simple forms, few type choices, and solid colour.\" Rather than pure subjectivity, BP&O lends supported opinions. Through exploring specific examples of company branding over a smattering of industries, Branding, & Packaging, is a must-read for businesses. Even if your company is not a web design company directly, you should still care about this space. Kissmetrics has an excellent article on the value of web design and its impact on the bottom line. Web Designer Depot is the go-to for the latest in all things web design. This blog features articles on content management systems, branding discussions, and there's even a comics section. Web design is a completely different medium than offline design. Even if you're not a web designer, Web Designer Depot is an excellent read which will revolutionize how you view sites you visit. Plus, there are web design agnostic pieces such as resources for finding quality stock images. Every business needs a logo. If you don't have one, drop everything and go get one (but only after you finish this article). Logomaker is a site that offers logo creation and design. The company blog is a wonderful resource that touches on both the design and business aspects of logo creation. Notably, it's spectacular for businesses because of its company-oriented content. Articles like \"5 Ways a Logo Can Help Market Your Business\" offer useful, practical knowledge. Posts vary from logo design news roundups to startup and small business coverage. Check out the Logomaker blog for a fascinating romp through the importance of logos, from design to business. User experience, or UX, is a crucial aspect in design. While UX is often associated with web and app design, there's a lot of crossover with offline design as well. UX Myths focuses on user experience misconceptions. Although we often discuss what to do, often what not to do is more important. The UX Myths tagline urges companies to \"Build your product based on evidence, not false beliefs. Accordingly, UX Myths is incredibly well researched and data driven, adding to its credibility. Follow UX Myths for actionable, data-driven concepts. AdWeek boasts wide-ranging coverage. While there's a dedicated Advertising and Branding section that discusses everything from mobile ads to esports, Press, Television, and Technology sections grace the header as well.  AdWeek offers news on the likes of breaking tech such as IoT and VR, potential ad campaigns, and more. For businesses, AdWeek not only analyzes more traditional design, but also popular spaces such as trending technology. It's a top choice for its versatility as a one-stop site for culture, tech, and branding articles. Looking for the latest in graphics, interactive design, product design, and more? Check out Fast Co. Design. True to the \"fast\" in its name, Fast Co. Design concentrates on groundbreaking design trends. Neat articles discuss modern tattoos, pollution-tracking wearables, and subway system layouts.

Canva's appropriately named Design School blog is data-driven, and really business focused. From case studies to web banner ad examples, and industry-specific flyer templates, Canva provides a bevy of insight into business design. Further positing Design School as a spectacular site is its tagging schema. Each post features a category, such as Book Cover Design or Social Media Marketing, which makes navigation and topical searching simple. While these are the design blogs your business needs to follow, there are certainly other excellent sites. Although decidedly less business-focused, Trend List and Eye On Design are great resources.

Why we like it. Because driving around in circles on a Monday morning searching for a parking spot is the wakeup call you need. Or let's take it one step further. It's Sunday and your car won't start at all. That's one week at the mechanics. Normally a great excuse not to make it to work but it's the week the CEO comes to visit, so you'll just have to be there.\n The PapaRide Network is a sharing platform that can gets you out of these sticky situations by giving you everything you need for your next ride.   You have four options -you can rent out your car or bike, you can find a car or bike to rent, you can pre-book a parking spot or you can find someone travelling in the same direction as you and carpool. All you need to do is sign up, book what you want to rent, whether that's a bike, car or parking spot, and drive safely. Just don't forget to return the car to the owner with at least a quarter of a tank. Now you might be thinking -hang on, isn't this like another Uber app? One app's enough. But it's not. It's an epic mash of Uber, Bixi, Blablacar and Montreal Parking with a few tweaks -you can go long distances cheaply or you can rent the car to drive yourself. You don't need a million little apps downloaded on your phone, just the one will do the trick. Even though we think that technology is isolating us from everyone else, it's not. It's just bringing us closer together. On one hand you should be less angry at the world. If the app goes to plan, there'll be less traffic on the road. And on the other hand trust in society is restored when someone saves your day and rents out their vehicle.  Moutiya specifies that this is a new more efficient method of collaborative transportation that can help reduce the amount of vehicles on the road. \"We see, the solutions currently in place to improve the state of urban congestion are far from perfect. What I propose is to help reduce the number of vehicles on our roads, with a group of services that are complementary to each other,\" said Mouliya.   ",

Conversion Logic has raised $14.1m to date, and will apply the new funds to expand its sales and marketing, data science and engineering efforts. \"With our platform marketers can make more efficient and intelligent media investments, as well as achieve advanced data governance, implementation, activation and accuracy,\" said Brian Baumgart, co-founder and CEO of Conversion Logic. \"We work with some of the largest global brands and our advanced enterprise analytics solution provides the intelligence layer needed to create a unified view across their data silos.\" With year-over-year bookings up 471 percent, the latest round of funding will be used to further sales, marketing and development of its enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform, and boost efforts across specific industries including automotive, home services and software. Powered by machine learning technologies, the platform provides cloud analytics applications for cross-channel attribution. Since its founding in 2014, Conversion Logic has worked with well-known brands such as ADT, Microsoft and many more. The platform provides these companies with a more sophisticated approach which improves cross-channel marketing efficiency by 30-50 percent. \"While CMOs continue to grapple with numerous adtech and martech silos, they are increasingly looking for a single source of truth to understand the efficacy of their marketing efforts,\" Baumgart added. \"The myriad of standards, channels, and walled gardens can make it an uphill battle to glean relevant, cross-channel actionable insights. Applying machine learning to the process can help Fortune 500 companies carve a path up that hill by optimizing their marketing programs holistically.\" A view across all offline and online marketing channels - through to conversion - is imperative to understand true ROI and to inform how and where to optimize and scale. The company's Ensemble machine learning framework and proprietary methodology resonates with CMOs who are no longer willing to accept a \"one size fits all\" single algorithm approach. \"Conversion Logic's data science driven platform provides the solution to the market's most pressing challenges - analytics and applications for cross-channel attribution,\" said Ben Dahl, a partner at Pelion Venture Partners. \"The platform offers marketers clear visibility into what's happening across all channels, and provides a portfolio view into synergy between stages of the customer path and relevant channels, as well as tactical insights to increase scale and cut waste.\"   ",

Why we like it : You've been dumped by the love of your life, broken your leg during your latest snowboard trip to Tahoe or caught a nasty flu off your co-worker who won't cover his damn mouth when he coughs. Sometimes in life for one reason or another we end up spending our free time sat on the couch at home.  What better way to spend this forced free time than binge-watching movies, series, nature documentaries or whatever media floats your boat? Whether it be the blood and partial nudity of Game of Thrones, the bad ass bikers of Sons of Anarchy or hilariously surreal humano-animalistic world of Bojack Horseman, the main way we consume our digital media these days is online. Now, your sister's netflix account might work for the more popular shows like the aforementioned, but when you start looking for older or more obscure content - say 1920s English gangland series Peaky Blinders or perhaps cult-indie classic Repo Man - you might have to troll through various different platforms to find it. Cue media curation platform MediaHound. Rather than flipping from Netflix to Hulu to Amazon to find your favorite content, Media Hound's platform lets users discover and share entertainment from all major media platforms in the same way Kayak does for flights. Founder and CEO Addison McCaleb built MediaHound after realizing that each individual media platform was limited by its own catalogue. The idea came to him when flipping through his on-demand streaming platforms looking for one of his favorite movies Elf, but the only place that offered it was Amazon. It dawned on the young entrepreneur that there was a fragmentation of digital distribution between the various sources of media content and he set about building the award-winning entertainment curation platform. Although the initial idea was focused on movies and series, McCaleb soon noticed that music, books and almost every type of entertainment was equally fragmented across different sources. MediaHound was designed to be the singular, unifying platform for all types of entertainment. Recently, they have won Webby and W3 awards for a number of new apps using their innovative algorithm, which allows users run a fast and comprehensive search spanning all types of media from movies to books, songs, and games as well as moods, themes, tones, genres, and reviews. We love it because it saves us time and makes searching for our favorite entertainment a hell of a lot easier. That's a big win in our book.   ",

    "content": "Do you have a killer idea for a startup company? Perhaps you've already got a plan in motion, and you're getting the initial stages worked out, or have already started implementing strategies and are picking up steam. Either way, you need the right tools to help manage your growth and keep you and your team on task. No matter what your business, here are few things that can help you gain a productivity edge. You're going to need a project management tool, and Taiga is one of the most interesting open source options in the game. What does Taiga allow you to do? It takes the Kanban methodology for dividing projects into various developmental stages but streamlines it in a way that is much easier to navigate than some of the more cumbersome options that exist on the market presently. Simple, intuitive, powerful, and customizable, this is one of the easiest ways to break down your work and get your entire team on the same page. Best of all, they have a free option to give you an opportunity to try it out and see if it will work for you and your crew before committing to a paid plan (with increased functionality). Need a way to prepare for meetings in a hurry? Charlie is the way to go. This personal assistant program \"combs through hundreds of sources and automatically sends you a one-pager on everyone you're going to meet with, before you see them.\" Think of it as Cliff's Notes for people, allowing you to get up to speed and put your best foot forward every time. You'll be able to make a striking first impression, and, hopefully, wow potential clients, wooing them over to your startup cause. On top of that, it'll save you the time of having to dig up all that important information yourself. If you need a way to chat with the whole team, whenever, wherever, then Voxer should be on your radar. This chat app, like most, lets you utilize text and photos to communicate but adds a nice twist : live voice chatting. Much like a walkie-talkie, you can buzz in and get your message out to the whole crew instantly. In addition, Voxer includes end-to-end encryption to help keep your chats secure. They have several pricing levels and a basic free service that allows you to try before you commit to a monthly plan. Privacy, convenience, and seamless syncing across devices; what more could you ask for? You're going to have to tame the raging beast that is email. Inky provides a secure way to make it happen and incorporate some quality encryption at the same time. In addition to top-tier email features, slick design, and all the relevant extras, you get high-grade security to protect your company secrets. You can integrate existing email accounts, and, as told by Inky, you can \"deploy Inky with custom policies to protect email data when an employee loses a device or leaves the company.\" Talk about secure. Let's face it, getting funding is a concern for any new venture. Crowdfunding has become a viable source of capital for many startups, but choosing the right platform from the myriad that already exists can be something of a chore. If you want to try something a bit different (but no less functional) you might give Plumfund a go. Designed by the creators of Honeyfund, this crowdfunding app can be used for just about anything, so have at it.

    "title": "The Lightning Pitch: Swyfft, making home insurance bearable",
    "content": "startup pitches. Company : Swyfft. Headquarters : Mobile, Alabama. Founding Team : Sean Maher. Why we like it : Out of all the products you could be browsing for on the internet, homeowner's insurance isn't exactly the most sexy now is it. In fact, it's as unsexy as you can possibly get. But for those fortunate enough to actually own a home, it is a necessity.  Swyfft takes the pain out of this process by providing lucky homeowners with a quote in seconds. Whereas other online based insurance platforms make you fill out endless, mind-numbing forms, prolonging the pain, all you need to do with Swyfft is type in your address and voila, you'll have yourself a quote for your big, shiny house, you lucky bastard. Founded in 2014, Swyfft propels home insurance into the twenty-first century. In a modern day David and Goliath, Swyfft is going up against the giants of the insurance world - think GEICO, Esurance, and Progressive. In this well-established market, the intelligent home insurance enterprise is disrupting the industry by using unique analytics, big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to save its customers time and money. Furthermore, customers receive an improved online user experience without sacrificing the underwriting integrity provided by traditional insurance firms. Swyfft's patented Big Data technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to turn analytical insights into big savings for consumers, all the while ensuring quality home protection. Swyfft's homeowners insurance covers the full cost of replacing your home, with no deduction for depreciation and no dollar limit. What's more, in addition to covering your home, Swyfft homeowners insurance policy provides important extra coverages including personal property, living expenses, personal liability and medical expenses. \nThe platform's web app is simple to use and easily customizable. Users simply enter their home address, with no personal information. Swyfft's multi-patented AI-driven technology sorts through data points - including, fires, hail, and tornados - to create policies that save an estimated 50% of customers money. Policies can then be quoted, adjusted, bound, issued and emailed to the customer in less than a minute, directly from a phone, tablet or laptop. Now, that's something that we would write home about or even buy a house for, if we ever had the money. ",
