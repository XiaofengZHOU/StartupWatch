    "title": "Investors are a driving force in shaping Africa's entrepreneurial ecosystem",
    "content": "If we look at the startup landscape in Africa (and read the press) it is clear that fintech is one of the fastest growing sectors on the continent. The African Tech Startups Funding Report, released in January by Disrupt Africa found that in 2016, 29.6% of startup investment in the region went to fintech companies. Read more: Report: African tech startups receive funding boost in 2016 This $55-million sum is a clear indication that there is energy and ambition among entrepreneurs and innovators for fintech -- and significant appetite from investors. However, fintech is only part of the picture. The entrepreneurial base has rapidly grown since 2015 - tech startups attracted 16.8% more funding in 2016 than 2015. The focus on early-stage startups is noticeable when looking at the figures from the Disrupt Africa Report: 146 early-stage companies received a total of $129m in 2016 - more startups sharing the pot with fewer \"standout tickets\". Fintech represents low-hanging -- fruit for innovators and investors because many parts of the region are underserved with financial services. We have also seen growth in machine-to-machine innovation in Africa. M2M refers to direct communication between devices using any communications channel, including wired and wireless. M2M includes industrial instrumentation. Thanks to application software, M2M can monitor temperatures and inventories, while in the consumer sector it can help to streamline products that consumers buy and keep them working efficiently. In Africa, M2M is being used for healthcare services, utilities, conservation and even the mining industry. Ovum's Africa Market Outlook, \"...believes that the utility sector offers the biggest opportunity among industry verticals in Africa for growth in M2M connections, particularly for the retail sector; mainly for payments, which are expected to be more profitable.\" The revolution in the telcommunications sector in sub-Saharan Africa is a story that we are already familiar with, particularly with mobile payment solutions. So, does this surge in technological entrepreneurship tell us anything about what is happening at a grassroots level, within communities and society in general? What we do know is that incubator hubs and region-wide funding initiatives have become significantly more widespread over recent years. There is a highly noticeable effort on the part of governments and private enterprises to raise awareness of entrepreneurship and promote innovation. \"Makerspaces\" have also come to the fore over the past few years, which provide a wider range of services and facilities than the traditional incubator hub: access to training in business skills, lectures, manufacturing and production facilities, bootcamp-style courses and rapid-growth accelerator hubs. The innovation ecosystem in Africa has done more than grow, it has exploded right across the region. Venture capital (VC) funding for startups has also sharply increased in Africa. Data from Crunchbase, TNA Analysis shows that VC funding for technology startups stood at only $40.6m in 2012. Within two years the figure surged to $414m and is projected to reach around $608m in 2018. The 2015 book, \"The Next Africa\" by Aubrey Hruby and Jake Bright also supports this trend. They point out that there are roughly 200 innovation hubs, 3,500 new tech-related ventures and $1 billion in venture capital to a pan-African movement of startup entrepreneurs. Fintech is clearly the story of the moment, with major successes such as bitcoin, blockchain and mobile-money solutions. Mobile technology is however also set to grow and provide major opportunities for VC's and investors. For several years, healthcare programmes have been rolled out using smart technologies. Examples include Nigeria's Smart programme, which dramatically reduces the turnaround time for infant HIV diagnosis. Notable startups in the sector this year include a low-cost solution for hearing problems, Vela (a medical referral app) and a non-invasive malaria testing kit called Matibabu. The entrepreneurial ecosystem is charging ahead in the right direction, creating jobs and wealth. Yet, most important is the fact that so many startups are creating practical, affordable solutions to problems on their own doorsteps: African solutions for African challenges. These solutions are transforming lives in every sphere of society, which makes what is happening in the world of African startups so important. The role that investors play is therefore especially important because there is a direct correlation between capital going in and game-changing innovations coming out. Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais is the founder of the African Innovation Foundation. ",

    "title": "'Nigeria's high cost of doing business is holding back acquisition of startups'",
    "content": "Nigeria's recession should have made the acquisitions of startups more affordable for foreign firms -- but instead the creation companies and building of new products has slowed because of the high cost of operating there, says Nigerian tech expert Emeka Okoye. \"Unfortunately most startups are centred in Lagos which is one of the most expensive cities in the world,\" said Okoye in an interview with Ventureburn. The city is ranked at number 13 out of 209 cities by Mercer in its 2016 Cost of Living rankings. Much of the high cost of doing business is down to expensive internet and firms having to pay for diesel to run generators (as electricity off the grid is unreliable). Read more: Tackle infrastructure, skills challenges to boost tech sector, say Nigerian experts Nigeria's tech sector has been in the spotlight ever since Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's visit there in September last year. Yet 20 years ago the country had a flourishing home-grown software sector even exporting to the US and Europe. Okoye says with the boom of the personal computer and the need for SMEs and large corporates to consume information technology products and services Nigeria became a technology leader in the early 1990s. \"Lots of entrepreneurs created software companies that built made-in-Nigeria software that beat the foreign ones in the local market even though they were more expensive at times. \"By 1995 when Nigeria had 89 banks, about 30 of these banks were running locally developed banking software. One of the companies that developed these banking software, Tara Systems, had already started exporting their banking software called Autobank to the US as well as Europe (read about it here). \"Also software companies like CSA Systems, from where Neptune Systems came out from, and Systemspecs whose flagship product is a Human Resource Software, were also exporting within Africa and beyond. He added that at the time the local assembly of computers from knocked down parts had grown to become a significant industry in Nigeria too. But he says software imports and the lure of big salaries paid by banks and telecommunication companies lured talented developers away from the tech sector. The poor support from the government has also not helped. \"Some of the governments and agencies are giving grants mostly on the basis of SME and not on technology or innovation. Our government does not fully understand how technology or innovation can boost the economy and how they can fuel it,\" he explained. Okoye mentioned in an interview last month with Techpoint that Nigeria could learn from India which set up technology institutes to train students. He added that other countries also hold lessons from Nigeria. He points to Brazil, which built the tech sector from academia; Israel, where the government supported entrepreneurship, innovation and inventions; the UK, where there is a flourishing tech ecosystem and where universities have clusters at institutions such as Oxford and Cambridge; and Canada, where local ecosystems were built on industry-academia relationships such as the University of Waterloo and other universities. In addition, he said while Nigeria has a significant expatriate community startups are not tapping into this. \"Some of us have links with the expat community due to our business relationships with them over the years but unfortunately the young ones have refused to tap into the experience of the older techies.\" A lack of mentoring is also a challenge: \"A lot of the young techies are being mis-advised or misled. They believe they know better and they can do it on their own.\" Despite the challenge he believes the Nigerian tech startups to keep an eye on are Hotels.ng (hotels), Iroko (entertainment), Flutterwave (fintech) Paystack (fintech) and Paga (fintech).

    "title": "Q&A: Lady Bonin founder shares her journey as a female entrepreneur",
    "content": "With Startup Grind Cape Town set to take place tomorrow (11 May) in celebration of Female Founders Month, we spoke to Jessica Bonin, founder of Lady Bonin's artisanal tea. Bonin, who will speak tomorrow at the event hosted at Workshop 17, spoke to us about her success and struggles as a female entrepreneur, touching on how it was to run a food truck as well as venture into a seemingly niche market. Ventureburn: Tell us about how you got started with a food truck? Jessica Bonin: When I first started the business my greatest challenge was reinventing tea. People had no concept of good quality tea, let alone loose leaf, and I was selling both as take away before Starbucks was. The caravan became an incredible way for me to overcome this hurdle because it was an innovative and new concept, that of food trucks, that engaged people and encouraged them to try something new. The innovation and its publicity and popularity helped push the concept of quality takeaway tea as something easy to integrate that allowed me to move into other avenues such as restaurant and retail sales. VB: What challenges did you face with a food truck? JB: My caravan was the first food truck and I had to break a lot of ground for everyone else, this meant countless hours of meetings with the city council and representatives to open avenues of trade. The biggest problem with food trucks in Cape Town and from what I understand around the world is trading locations. Because it is not informal trade it does not allow for trading in town. Space is limited and food trucks continue to increase. It is also very seasonal meaning summer time tends to be the best time for a trade. The hours are long, the effort is high and the turnover is challenging. We resorted to doing lots of markets, festivals and private functions. The caravan has been on sabbatical for just over a year as we make new plans to hand it over to a small and driven entrepreneur. People think food trucks are an easy fix, a quick buck. It is really not. And there is a lot of competition. Luckily for me, I wasn't running a kitchen, I had something entirely unique and sought after. VB: What then is your advice for those who want to run a food truck? JB: I usually advise people against starting a food truck because the cons far outweigh the pros. However, like anything, if you are an innovative entrepreneur with ambition and tenacity, you can make anything happen, you just have to find the unique avenue in an over-saturated market. VB: Are your tea leaves sourced from other entrepreneurs such as yourself?  JB: 80% of our tea is sourced directly from farms. I try to avoid the middleman wherever possible, both locally and internationally, because I believe in providing a platform to bridge the gap between farmer and market. VB: What were some of the biggest challenges you faced running your business? JB: Throughout the business, the biggest challenge has been cash flow. Running a tea business means small margins, resulting in a greater need for quantity. We reached a point where market demand was exceeding our ability to supply, but in order to reach that supply ability, we had to scale, which means we had to expend cash before we earned it. This has taken a long time to catch up, meaning money for not only staffing and raw materials, but working capital for everything that has gone into scaling the business to a point where we can reach higher productivity and exceed market demand, growing it more and more. VB: What struggles did you have to endure as a woman growing your business? JB: When I first started the business, people looked at the idea of the Tea Caravan and thought it was \"quaint\" and \"cute\" as if the business was just a fun craft project because I was a woman. Farmers and processing companies are 100% male and have a preconditioned idea that women are incapable of managing anything to do with agriculture. Being taken seriously is challenging, and setting up long-term relationships in itself is something that ticks over in the long term. VB: How is your business doing currently?  JB: We are currently at seven staff members, six of whom are women. We aim to skill from within the business, therefore work with the goals of our employees to train and move them into different roles in the business as it scales. Our revenue is increasing at a rate of 40% to 60% per annum. Our projections and scaling strategy should increase this to about 100% within the next year.

    "title": "'Silicon Cape event to tackle lack of diversity in tech sector'",
    "content": "Cape tech group Silicon Cape plans to address the lack of diversity in the Cape tech sector - a sector dominated by white males - at an event in Cape Town later this month. Entrepreneur Antoinette Prophy, who holds the diversity and transformation portfolio on Silicon Cape's community council and runs business mentoring organisation 88collective, told Ventureburn today that the event - Tech eKasi - would be held on May 31. \"Most of the boardrooms that I step into are (dominated by) pale males. It's our responsibility to bring more women into tech,\" she said. Prophy was speaking today as part of a panel discussion on gender equality held in Cape Town at the offices of mobile money company Zoona. The event formed part of the global 50/50 day organised by filmmaker Tiffany Shlain to promote her film 50/50. \"There's this notion that women are not comfortable in tech, but not in my world,\" said Prophy. However she added that the tech sector often came across as 'elitist\" and difficult for women to enter. She pointed out that Silicon Cape has also been engaging with students at the University of Western Cape and the University of Cape Town on why so few students choose to open their own business. Most she students reckoned were not choosing to do so because they simply \"don't know how\". She also hinted that under newly appointed managing director Ellen Fischat, who started her position on Monday, Silicon Cape is looking to do things differently. \"There's a new community council, a new managing director, the new approach is not let's take what has worked -- as it's clearly not worked,\" says Prophy. Read more: New Silicon Cape head pledges to make sector's 'old boys' club' more inclusive Ventureburn asked why South Africa does not have any initiative that targets high-growth women entrepreneurs - such as Start-Up Chile (S Factory) or Enterprise Ireland (Going for Growth) do. Prophy pointed to the Women in Tech programme which is run by public speaker Robyn Farah and aims to hold networking sessions to address the shortage of female tech workers. Editors, why is \"pale males\"  acceptable to use in print? How is this any less bigoted than using \"darkies?\"  If you are trying to encourage diversity and inclusivity , this is not the way to go about it.

    "content": "Cape startup Property Fox may have saved South Africans R5-million in estate-agent commissions since launching in April last year, but their disruptive online model is stirring up a storm in the local property market. The company only charges customers 1.5% in sales commission -- significantly lower than the 5% to 7.5% of the selling price that estate agents usually charge. What has irked some agents is that the company allows a buyer and seller can communicate on the positives and negatives of the property before a sale is concluded. \"Traditional agents always say to you 'don't let the buyer meet the seller because there's so much emotion attached to the sale'. Our first sale happened because the buyer met the seller,\" says Crispin Inglis, who founded the company with and Ashley James. Casting off any doubts that the company is sidestepping any rules, Inglis says the company is fully compliant with the respective legislation. \"We fall under (the law) the same way estate agents do... we always knew that as a disruptor we'd need to be fully compliant,\" said Inglis. Yet despite becoming compliant, Inglis says the company has remained concerned about whether potential customers might adapt to using their services to sell property online. \"Our biggest achievement was a lovely lady who we were worried about would have difficulty using tech... when she signed up with us she was able to sell it within a week,\" said Inglis. But despite all the seemingly negatives that Property Fox faced, the company has managed to list 400 properties in its first year as well as generate R96-million in sales. This year alone Property Fox has managed to list 100 new properties with 30 sales across the country. Property Fox was funded in four equal parts by its founders as well as two silent shareholders to the value of R1m.   Wow!  Inspired by VR Headset tech to view properties.  Nice One. ",

The cohort was launched in February. Read more: TenaCiTi to enhance junior recruits for small businesses William Hurst, a developer and partner of startup Zero Zero One says programmes such as TenaCiTi should almost be a \"requirement\" as it \"smooths off so many rough edges\". \"Stuff that people don't always know when they walk in on the first day, like how do you talk to a client, what it means when you miss a deadline and you don't tell anybody -- all those little things that are never really spoken about and you're just expected to learn.\" The graduates of the 2017 cohort are: As much as the programme helped the company's and its recruits, it has also had an effect on managers and owners. \"It developed myself as the leader to adapt and change... I have changed to make sure that I have systems and processes in place,\" said Damien Michael, founder of Innovo Networks. \"The second thing is that it also developed the morale and the motivation for the intern that was on the programme. It got him to clearly understand his roles and responsibilities and to take action. \"The third thing is after I've put the systems and processes in place, each employee from an HR perspective understands where they're going and what they need to do, what their roles and responsibilities are,\" said Michael. Chris Megan, co-founder of uGoMyWay, commented on the importance of good HR processes which TenaCiTi has made a point of emphasising. \"I think everything they're (TenaCiTi) doing from a junior recruit view is completely valid.

    "title": "New Silicon Cape head pledges to make sector's 'old boys' club' more inclusive",
    "content": "Silicon Cape's new managing director says she plans to get the Cape's tech scene -- long tagged as an \"old boys' club\", with moneyed white males dominating the region's startup ecosystem -- to become more inclusive. \"Research I've done and the whispering I've heard is it (Cape) may not be inclusive and may be an old boys' club,\" Ellen Fischat told Ventureburn. \"The fact of the matter is 20 years ago there were no black tech operators so what we see at the moment is a consequence of history,\" says Fischat, who started her new position yesterday (8 May). Fischat, who is from Port Elizabeth, has been involved in business incubation since 2011. Between 2011 and 2015, she was involved in Port Elizabeth's Seda ICT incubator. From 2015 until recently she managed the Propella business incubator, where she assisted the Nelson Mandela Metro University to set up a programme to commercialise the university's intellectual property. \"Being a black female in this industry I'm very passionate about providing access to knowledge and opportunities to the previously disadvantaged,\" says Fischat. \"It's not about handouts or helping the poor, it's about how do you equip people and provide them with networks,\" she adds. Fischat is Silicon Cape's first permanent head. Previously, the organisation, which was started in 2009 by entrepreneurs Vinny Lingham and Justin Stanford to promote the local tech ecosystem, was run by a team of part-time volunteers. The organisation's new head may hail from out of town, but she said being a black woman from outside the Cape gave her an advantage. \"The benefit of being an outsider is I have no history, affiliation or loyalty to this ecosystem. I'm the new girl on the block,\" she says. New Silicon Cape managing director Ellen Fischat While she was selected as Silicon Cape head in March, Fischat has yet to map out any new plans for the organisation. However she pointed to the organisation's five key strategic aims for 2017, which were set by the organisation's committee last year. They include creating and enabling an inclusive ecosystem. The four remaining strategic aims are: When asked what she thought of outgoing National Treasury director-general Lungisa Fuzile announcing last month that the government would not match the R1.5-billion the private sector had invested into the SA SME Fund, Fischat said she was disappointed. \"I think it's disappointing, because if anything the government acknowledges they (the state) need private support to roll out these job-creation initiatives,\" she says. Read more: Government won't match private sector in R1.5bn SME fund' She says she now aims to go out and meet with the various roleplayers in the Cape tech and entrepreneurship ecosystem. \"My greatest value is my ability to connect -- to connect people, or parties -- to build on existing international relations and look at the city as not only a holiday destination but a place to do business,\" he says. Silicon Cape chairman Daniel Guasco says the appointment of a full-time managing director will allow for a full-time team to be developed. He says Silicon Cape receives funding from a number of organisations, with FNB being the main backer. The organisation has about 10 000 subscribers to its newsletters.

    "title": "B2B ecommerce's untapped potential: How innovative companies can capitalise on the massive gap for growth",
    "content": "Cape Town, 25th January, 2016: Ecommerce in South Africa - while still just a slice of the overall retail pie - is growing as much as 35% per year*. However, of this, the lion's share still operate in the B2C space, suggesting that B2B companies - those that use the web to sell goods and services to other businesses - have yet to cotton-on to its very lucrative potential. So says Charlie Stewart, CEO of digital marketing agency Rogerwilco and co-author of Business to Business Marketing. A Step-by-Step Guide (Penguin). \"B2B is perceived as the less sexy sister of B2C, despite having a massive traditional footprint in South Africa. It's also been slower to respond to customers' new digital diets that sees them - be it to look for an air conditioner or forklift - use search as a primary source to enquire or buy.\" So what's holding it back? Lethargy says Stewart. \"It takes time and money to successfully operate in the ecommerce space. A core component of its efficacy relies on the creation of useful content that is amplified across the web to match customers' Google searches.\" In other words, if the owner of a SME wants to acquire the services of a tax consultancy, they are likely to look online first to review services and prices. \"But if the tax practitioner isn't there, then it's lost itself a potential sale,\" explains Stewart. There's also fear of online fraud. \"We're still coming to grips with buying online with approximately 22% of local internet users having yet made an electronic purchase,\" says Stewart. Companies also need to ensure they have robust IT systems that can manage online enquiries and orders. \"Otherwise they risk reputational damage if they're unable to deliver the goods.\" Overcoming these challenges could yield significant changes for local B2B ecommerce. Especially given companies reportedly gain 44% in order value by going online suggests a 2015 report from eCommerce Insights.com. \"Besides the now ubiquitous success stories of Uber and AirBnB, innovative entrepreneurs in other industries are also using digital to disrupt traditional peers,\" says Stewart. Take travel for instance. \"While the industry as a whole is set for a tough 2016, its fastest growth segment is independent travel consultants or ITCs,\" says Rian Bornman, founder of FlightSiteAgent, a B2B online travel provider. \"Estimated to represent R3-billion of the R37-billion travel category, it's attracting travel consultants who break away from their previous jobs to go it alone.\" Launched three years ago, the platform enables ITCs as well as individuals without prior experience - e.g. stay-at-home moms or township entrepreneurs - to search, hold, book or ticket flights free of charge for clients, family or friends using its online platform. They can also conduct business at home or from small offices at a fraction of the cost of traditional agents who may rent space in malls or high streets. \"The beauty of an online B2B model is its scalability into new markets and functionality,\" says Bornman. \"Locally, I believe these platforms, not only in travel, offer the unique opportunity to unlock value through job creation, skills transfer and stakeholder transformation; all equally important goals in a South African context.\" Stewart concurs but suggests that innovative start-ups and individuals are those who'll likely adapt the fastest to B2B online models - despite the multiple benefits available for traditional industries like mining to capitalise on. \"The so-called 'self-sold market' that sees buyers search for, research and evaluate products online, is typified by people who are connected and comfortable online.  As such, it's natural for them to break-away from traditional B2B business models and launch ecommerce platforms that cut out the need for bricks n mortar premises and intermediaries,\" says Stewart. \"And when they do, there will be plenty of unclaimed territory for them to leverage and market their B2B businesses, products and services to,\" he concludes. Business to Business Marketing: A Step-by-step guide by Charlie Stewart and Mark Eardley is due to be released in February and will be available from bookstores and Takealot for R220. ",

    "title": "Steam launches VR video category",
    "content": "Valve's Steam store is the undisputed leader of PC game distribution, though the marketplace is also a portal for buying VR games, software, and even traditional movies. Through a partnership with Seattle-based startup Pixvana, Valve is also launching a VR video section aimed at bringing many of the benefits of distributing a 360-degree video on Facebook or Google's YouTube to PC users consuming content through Steam. Steam's 360 Video Player is launching in beta today, integrating Pixvana's SPIN VR video streaming technology for VR videos. The end result should be a \"one-click\" solution for watching 360-degree content, using a Rift or Vive headset to check out the video in VR. Soon, they will also add the ability to use a mouse to look around a video on a flat 2D screen. \"Pixvana's SPIN SDK has been a great asset in our efforts to empower VR content creators and provide an integrated solution for experiencing linear VR content on Steam,\" said Valve's Sean Jenkin in a prepared statement. The 360 Video Player is built using Pixvana's software development kit (SDK) for playback and streaming of the content in multiple formats. Pixvana notably developed its own adaptive streaming technology that efficiently delivers video quickly at a high quality. Capturing, editing, and delivering 360-degree videos is a hard problem for filmmakers and content production companies to overcome, and the team-up between Valve and Pixvana aims to give these creators another route beyond Facebook and YouTube for delivering their content at a sweet spot of speed and quality both inside and outside of VR. \"We're working hard to help all content creators and consumers create immersive experiences that look sharp and feel life-like. We are excited to partner with Valve to bring these solutions to a vast audience so that people everywhere can experience VR's true potential,\" said Pixvana cofounder and CEO Forest Key, in a prepared statement. Some of content available initially includes the Alien: Covenant VR experience, Lego Batman: The Batmersive Experience, and others. Here are the features included in the initial launch, according to an FAQ: This story originally appeared on Uploadvr.com. Copyright 2017 ",

    "title": "Blockchain fundings are trendy, but we're still in the Wild West days",
    "content": "Many startups are currently testing out one of the most exciting new investment trends: blockchain-based initial coin offerings (ICOs). Still unregulated and open for anyone to invest in, not just VCs, these token crowdsales are like Kickstarter campaigns for the crypto world. For those unfamiliar with the idea, startups wanting to build blockchain-based apps (called 'decentralized apps' or dApps) can forge a new blockchain to build them on top of or can build them on established public blockchains -- such as Ethereum, which is currently seeing most of these projects. These startups pull in funding by selling off tokens of their own cryptocurrency. With the rising interest in blockchain-based services, it has become trendy to invest in these 'initial coin offerings'. Currently these investments are based largely on speculation and fear of missing out, so most people throwing money at these projects are taking a big risk. There's usually only one round of fundraising in an ICO, and this happens before the startup has even launched its solution. If the company has something concrete to showcase, it's usually just a proof of concept or in alpha stage -- although there are a few exceptions, like Storj, that have come out of beta before starting their token sale. So most investors don't have access to the information they need to make informed decisions; they know very little about how the solution is going to work in the real world. The startups and projects running these ICOs usually put up a website (they all tend to look and feel the same, by the way) presenting their solution in a white paper. And often this is the scope of hobbyist investors' due diligence, when they really should know the team and the product they're building in detail, for example by reviewing their source code. There are sites like ICOrating that analyze and assess startups with an upcoming ICO. Still, millions of dollars are being sunk into these projects without a proper appreciation of the risk. Naivety could be one reason. It's easy to get blinded by the massive successes of the Bitcoin and Ether currencies. As long as a new project is being built on a blockchain and has a token, it must be the next big thing, right? With so many new projects launching (19 ongoing ICOs and 35 upcoming listed at the time of this writing), there are probably many that never should receive funding, like the OneCoin scam. Potential investors should also keep in mind that public blockchains, such as Ethereum, are currently platforms for experimental ideas. App makers are trying out all types of new things, and no one knows how this dApp landscape is going to look in a year or two. Although it's getting there, the tech stack isn't quite ready yet either, something Fred Ehrsam illustrated nicely in this Medium post. It's hard to believe that all of the new blockchains being built will have real world value and see adoption beyond a handful of crypto enthusiasts. And they need to go mainstream to build a strong enough community of people willing to help and promote them. But this means that the startup has no idea who's investing in the crowdsale. The average random investor is likely placing bets on several projects due to hype and FOMO and the chance of a quick profit. He or she usually has a day job to take care of and isn't the idealist or evangelist who takes that active role that the company needs to succeed. Some of these developer teams will probably get acqui-hired by larger incumbents, and their concepts incorporated as features of existing products down the road -- similar to what Spotify did with its recent acquisition of blockchain startup Mediachain. Many others, of course, will fail. There is unlimited potential for ecosystems running on blockchains, and I can't wait to see where this is heading. However, due to the experimental, immature, and volatile state of this market at the moment, it's probably not the place to invest if you don't fully understand the offering. Editor's note: For a different take on investing in blockchain startups, see: \"The sooner you know about decentralization, the better you can adapt.\" [A version of this story originally appeared on the author's LinkedIn blog.] Trond Vidar Bjoroy is head of product development and implementation - Nordics at travel management company ATPI.

    "title": "Silk Ventures launches $500 million inaugural fund for U.S and EU companies expanding to China",
    "content": "Silk Ventures, a venture capital firm headquartered in London, with additional hubs in Menlo Park, Beijing, and Shenzen, has closed its inaugural investment fund at $500 million, targeting later-stage technology companies looking to expand into China. With a specific focus on so-called \"scale-up\" firms from the U.S. and Europe, Silk Ventures announced the fund at China's two-day One Belt, One Road (OBOR) event in Beijing, an occasion that brings dozens of state-leaders from around the world together. Founded in 2015 with backing from the Chinese government, Silk Ventures has so far operated as an accelerator of sorts, working on a number of initiatives both to help Chinese companies internationalize and startups from elsewhere enter China. The first fund will focus specifically on Series A-level startups looking to target the Chinese market, covering artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), fintech, robotics, medical tech, and more. The investment pot is half funded by Chinese state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) Shenzhen, while the remainder comes from \"a group of confidential strategic corporations,\" according to a statement issued by Silk Ventures, though the names are expected to be revealed in July. The VC firm has yet to conclude any investments form its first fund, a spokesperson told VentureBeat, but it does expect to announce its first deals in July too. Angelica Anton, founding partner of SILK Ventures, said: We are proud to announce our first fund which will enable us to invest into some of the world's most promising scaling businesses and technologies. We are the only venture fund in the world doing what we are doing. We are globally aligned with expert partners in the U.S., Europe and Asia to work with China at the highest levels to ensure that our portfolio companies are not only well-funded, but have the best chance of success in the Asian market. Silk Ventures was built to change the way Chinese capital marries Western technologies, and we pride ourselves on the cultural and operational know-how within our expanding team. Silk Ventures emerged as the European HQ for Shenzhen's Department of Trade and Investment, which partnered with Silk Ventures to open their office in Canary Wharf in London. And this tight tie-up gives a clue as to how closely China's government will be working with Silk Ventures -- it will be providing the \"support and funding needed by promising technology companies to expand into the Chinese market,\" according to a statement. A number of other funds have come to the fore in recent times, designed to create close links between China and western markets. Last year, Chinese investment firm Cocoon Networks launched a $715 million fund aimed at helping European startups grow in China, while IDG Capital Partners, the China-focused incarnation of San Francisco VC company IDG Ventures, launched a gargantuan $1 billion fund in conjunction with Silicon Valley VC firm Breyer Capital. Ultimately, any company looking to enter China faces significant regulatory hurdles, so it helps to have the local networks and partners on board to begin with. Silk Ventures' main selling point to European and U.S. scale-ups is that it will be working directly with official Chinese local government departments, which should go some way toward easing the path to entering what should prove to be a lucrative market.

    "title": "How to find a job in one of Latin America's tech hubs",
    "content": "I've lived in Santiago, Chile for six years, and in just this short time I've witnessed Latin America's tech ecosystem grow by leaps and bounds. Programs like Start-Up Chile, 500 Startups: Latam, and NXTP Labs are seeding Latin America's tech ecosystem and providing incredible resources for local entrepreneurs. Thanks to these programs, and many others, I've seen a surge in not only Latin American companies launching for local markets but also in US startups opening offices here, along with local entrepreneurs attacking the US market. This growth has generated a new wave of highly-skilled, international tech companies operating in Latin America. As someone who has operated a tech company in Latin America and worked with countless startups with a Latin American presence, I receive numerous emails from US-based tech workers who are curious to know what the current tech job market looks like and how they can get involved. The short answer is, the most in-demand professionals are Ruby on Rails developers, UI/UX designers, and online marketers. But there is also a significant demand for native English speakers to fill sales and customer service roles. As the Latin American startup ecosystem gains traction and more and more tech companies around the world are granting their tech workers the flexibility and/or option to work remotely, the number of emails asking me for advice on how to land a tech job in Latin America has picked up. I thought it would be useful to break down the four options for expat tech workers who are looking for job opportunities in Latin America: Working remotely for a US company Working for an established Latin American company Working with a Latin American startup targeting Latin America Working with a Latin American startup targeting the US market If you're interested in landing a job at a startup in Latin America or just learning more about how you can work remotely from Latin America, here's a breakdown of each of these options as well as a list of the top tech hubs in Latin America to help you get started. If you have the opportunity to work remotely for a US company and still make a US salary or hourly rate, you can live exceptionally well in most Latin American cities. Of course, the downside of working 100 percent remotely is you won't really be exposed to the local tech ecosystem, and it will be harder to make friends with locals. If you're a freelancer with established US clients, a good way to tap into the local tech ecosystem is to work from one of the numerous, affordable coworking spaces across Latin America. Some of the most notable coworking spaces include: Areatres and La Maquinita, Buenos Aires, Argentina Edge Cowork, Santiago, Chile AtomHouse, Bogota and Medellin, Colombia Impact Hub and El 3er Espacio, Mexico City, Mexico Piloto 151, San Juan, Puerto Rico WeWork, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Mexico City Sinergia Cowork, Montevideo, Uruguay  Keep in mind, if you're working remotely for a US company, you will have a harder time getting a work visa and will need to arrange your travel plans accordingly. For example, you may be required to leave the country or change countries every 90 days so that you can stay on a tourist visa. If you would like to try working for an established Latin American company, remember that tech salaries in the region are much lower than in the US. Fortunately, so is the cost of living. If you choose to go this route in countries like Chile, getting a work visa can be relatively easy. All you need is a job offer, and you can quickly get a one-year temporary visa. Keep in mind, more established companies do tend to favor fluent Spanish speakers and professionals with degrees from reputable Latin American or US universities. Additionally, similar to working for larger companies in the US, you probably won't be working on the most cutting-edge technologies. You might also have a manager who doesn't know all that much about technology, and you might find the working conditions unorganized and chaotic. However, the advantages of a stable income, decent salary (even if it's less than what you'd make in the US), and a work visa can offset some of these challenges. Over the last decade, the number of work visas being granted by Chile alone has risen by an average of 25 percent per year as the demand for more foreign professionals has spiked. According to Cisco, Latin America will lack nearly half a million IT professionals by 2019, with the largest skills gap in emerging technologies such as video, cloud, mobility, big data, cybersecurity, IoT, and software development. If you have experience in any of these areas, you could find exciting opportunities to put your skills to work for a Latin American startup targeting the Latin American market. Most of the Latin American companies hiring tech workers in these fields will pay $2,000 - $3,500 per month. Good places to search for positions like these at Latin American startups is Workana or Chiletrabajos. Although the founders of most Latin American startups and some of the tech team will speak English, be prepared for most, if not all, of the product and marketing to be in Spanish. On the plus side, working for a Latin American startup can make it easier to get a work visa, and your team can help you quickly integrate with the local tech scene. You'll also have a chance to polish your Spanish - it's how I learned! If you don't currently have any tech skills, or you are looking for an entry-level position, consider coming to Latin America to work as an intern, as the costs of living are lower, and learn some new skills. This will help you get connected with the local startup scene and then you can stay to work full-time afterward. Latin American boot camp programs, such as World Tech Makers, Desafio Latam, and Digital House, will teach you the tech skills startups are looking for and even help connect you with companies during and after the program. You can also look at Awesome Jobs, which lists job opportunities with tech companies from around the region, many of which welcome people who could benefit from on the job training. The last and perhaps best option for English-only speakers, is to work with a Latin American startup, or a foreign startup with offices in Latin America, that is targeting the US market. There are countless startups with a product or service for US consumers that have back offices for their tech and sales teams in Latin America. For example, did you know there is an agile team building core parts of Eventbrite's global platform in an office in Mendoza, Argentina? Working for a Latin American startup targeting the US will bring a monthly salary similar to working for a traditional company in Latin America; however, if you have a lot of experience or a specific skillset that is in high demand, you could bring in upwards of $6,000 per month. Even though it's difficult to find a job with a salary that matches US salaries for the same position, your day-to-day expenses will be significantly lower in most Latin American countries, allowing you to live as if you were earning 2x-3x as much in the US. Not to mention, companies that target the US market will offer added benefits such as the ability to work in English and obtain a work visa while working on interesting tech problems and still having the opportunity to learn Spanish. Tapping into this tech scene can be challenging as information is often outdated or dispersed across various networks. Just as in other parts of the world, the best opportunities often come through word-of-mouth. There are many ways to get connected to the Latin American tech scene, such as attending networking events, workshops at local universities, and meetups. A good place to start is Hackers and Founders, Founderlist, or Meetup.com, which offers dozens of groups related to tech and startups in Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and more. To find job postings, be sure to frequently check Craigslist, LinkedIn, and expat forums, which are widely used to share opportunities in English. So where are the tech hotspots in Latin America with the most potential? Here are some of the best cities to start your search: Santiago, Chile: This capital city is home to Start-Up Chile, one of the most successful startup programs in the world. The program has placed the country on the global map and turned the city into Latin America's \"Chilecon Valley.\" Last month, the Chilean government introduced a new tech visa allowing tech workers, investors, and entrepreneurs to obtain a work visa in just 15 days. Medellin, Colombia: The tech scene in Medellin is growing fast with support from talented entrepreneurs, smart venture capitalists, and programs like Ruta N that offer grants to help entrepreneurs and local tech talent succeed. A short plane ride away from major US cities, Medellin is uniquely positioned to continue expanding its position as a key tech hub in Latin America. Mexico City, Mexico: With a population over 25 million, Mexico City is home to many tech companies that have found success solely by servicing the local market. However, proximity to the US still attracts entrepreneurs with a global vision, and many US companies also have offices of their development teams in the city. Guadalajara, Mexico: Though a smaller city, Guadalajara is another booming tech hub in Mexico to keep on your radar. Some of the best engineers in Mexico are located here, which has also attracted US companies to set up their development teams in the city. Buenos Aires, Argentina: Home to one of Latin America's most vibrant venture capital ecosystems, Buenos Aires has a wealth of IT talent and tech companies in a range of sectors. Last month, the government introduced a new Entrepreneurs' Law that promises to help companies launch their businesses in 24 hours and give more incentive to local VCs to fund new ventures, meaning local companies are going to find it much easier to scale their teams. San Juan, Puerto Rico: With a highly-trained workforce and attractive tax structure, Puerto Rico is turning to technology and entrepreneurship to revitalize its economy. Programs like Parallel 18 have helped the island quickly make a name for itself as an emerging tech hub in the region, and it shows no signs of slowing down. There are many other cities that could be added to the list, but the point is, Latin America's tech scene is thriving, and there's never been a better time to be a part of it. If there is one thing startups struggle with, no matter where they're located, it is finding top tech talent. So if you're amazing at what you do and eager to immerse yourself in the local startup ecosystem, Latin America could be a good move for you.

    "title": "The sooner you know about decentralization, the better you can adapt",
    "content": "The news made the rounds in early April. \"America's Retailers Are Closing Stores Faster Than Ever\" read a Bloomberg headline. \"These 21 Retailers Are Closing 3,591 Stores -- Who Is Next?\" wrote Forbes. It felt like the end of an era for many. Back in 1998, I worked at a company called Snickelways (alas, it didn't make it), but the focus was on e-commerce. Anyone working in the industry then (and there were a lot of us) saw the writing on the wall.  We knew that traditional retailing would die. The only thing we didn't know was when. This past Sunday, I was in a local Best Buy. The only reason I was there was because it is the closest place to my house where I can recycle electronics. So, once a quarter or so, I drop old items off. As I headed out of the store, I paused and looked around. It was 5:15 pm on a Sunday and the store was basically empty. There were maybe five customers that I could see. And 10-15 employees. No one was in line at the cash register. No one was in line at customer service. I've been to a morgue, so I won't say, \"it was like a morgue,\" but wow ... was it quiet. I asked the two guys working at the door (ostensibly to prevent shoplifters) if this was average. \"Pretty much,\" one said. \"And weekdays are even less.\" I'm not a genius at investing, but my first thought was, \"I should short this stock.\" (They seem to be doing ok as of late, though and this guy is bullish, so what do I know?). And that brings me to one of my favorite topics: decentralized blockchain-based apps. I'm a blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiast, so I tend to talk to my friends a lot about the spectacular rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum. When the topic came up last weekend, one of my friends said, \"I'll probably never buy it, even though I get it. I'm just not comfortable putting my money there.\" Fine, I've heard that before. Then, he went on to say, \"I have a history of foresight that, if I had acted upon, I would have made a lot of money.  I was using eBay very early, but I just didn't have the confidence to invest.\" And he named several other examples. So, I asked him, \"If you keep having foresight about change and, in hindsight, you were right about your foresight, why don't you ever follow up on the next set of foresigths you have?\" \"Ah,\" he said. \"That's why I have a job. People are terrible about changing behavior until they absolutely have to.\" As I encounter resistance to the ideas behind blockchain, decentralization, and perhaps more broadly, higher education in the US, I experience a tremendous sense of deja vu. I've personally heard each of those comments.People don't do well with change. It makes us uncomfortable. I get that. But whether you like it or not, change happens. And we all need to deal with it. The only question is when. I don't know the \"when\" of how the world moves to greater decentralization of its systems, technology, governments, and more. There are obviously plenty of entrenched interests of people who don't want that to happen. Just like Sears, Kmart, and others didn't want e-commerce. But the trendline, at least for me, is clear. If decentralization is inevitable, a number of industries and institutions  will go away in 5, 10, or 20 years. To some, like the retailers of today, it will come as a surprise. To others -- those who spend the time to understand the implications of things like blockchains, decentralized autonomous organizations and crypto-tokens -- it will be expected. We all have a choice as to which group we will be in. Jeremy Epstein is CEO of Never Stop Marketing and currently works with startups in the blockchain and decentralization space, including OB1/OpenBazaar, Internet of People, & Storj. He advises F2000 organizations on the implications of blockchain technology. Previously, he was VP of marketing at Sprinklr from Series A to \"unicorn\" status. ",

    "title": "Can Google's 20% time really work for your startup?",
    "content": "Google's 20 percent time is one of the most famous, and arguably successful, management practices of all time. In their 2004 IPO letter, Google's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revealed that the policy of allowing employees to take time out of their core jobs to be creative and experimental had led to some of the company's most successful products. AdSense, which now accounts for about 25 percent of Google's total revenue, Gmail, Google Transit and Google News were all born out of 20 percent time. Facebook, LinkedIn and Apple have all implemented their own versions of 20 percent time, but as huge and highly successful technology companies with money to spare, it's a bet they can afford to make. How does a small or medium sized business free up 20 percent of its employees' time without jeopardizing the bottom line? At Google employees are allowed to use their 20 percent time when they like, but in a small company a more planned approach may be necessary to ensure there's always enough resource working on the core product or business. At Server Density we give our engineers a quota of one week out of every six to work on whatever they like, as long as it's relevant to the company; something we call a \"random week.\" This policy has resulted in some key product innovations for us. For example, one of our developers chose to use several of his random weeks over a period of several months to refactor and reimplement our server-monitoring time series graphing engine. We would get regular reports of minor graphing bugs, which were small on their own but added up to make our graphing a pain point for customers. We didn't focus on it in our usual roadmap because we had higher priority feature requests. After several of our larger customers made similar complaints, we decided to take our developer's random-week work and have the entire frontend team focus on it to completion. It seems an obvious point, but the spirit of 20 percent time is to allow as much free rein to your employees as possible. Small businesses that need to keep a closer eye on return on time investment could set some parameters on how the time is used, or alternatively set up some kind of ranking of pain points that need solving within the business, with an incentive system for coming up with solutions. That way you can gently encourage creativity in the most useful direction. LinkedIn held regular hack days giving awards to people who wrote snippets of code quickly. Later they introduced the LinkedIn InCubator, where employees were allowed up to 90 days to work on a project, with check points at each month to check the projects were worthwhile. InCubator gave rise to a number of useful products, including a toolkit for pointing out new features as users move around the LinkedIn site. When struggling with the idea of giving your employees one day in five, or whatever proportion of time you decide, to use as they wish, remember that no one is ever 100 percent productive with their time. By encouraging employees to work on side projects you are at least allowing them to \"slack off\" productively. You will also ensure they feel valued and encourage a positive, engaged culture, especially if those projects then get incorporated into core (or new) products. It's also a very good way to allow your team time to learn new technologies, improve their skills, and stay up to date with the industry. This can be difficult to achieve given how fast things move in tech and when formal \"training\" sessions and conferences can often be boring or not particularly useful. Although the graphing rewrite project at our company was started by one engineer as a way to move an old area of code from the Backbone to Facebook's React framework, the rest of the team also learned new techniques from the migration. Updating legacy code is always challenging. One of the engineers on the project wrote a  blog post about the lessons learned; another was able to  explore some complex color selection algorithms, an area of particular interest to her. What started as an engineering project crossed over to help our marketing team publish high quality content, which our customer success team is now using as part of an upcoming webinar to existing customers. The benefits can be seen across the business. Whatever system you come up with, encouraging creativity among your developers not only makes sound business sense from a product development point of view, it will also help you attract the best talent. A  recent report from Stack Overflow ranked the opportunity for professional development as one of the top five job benefits for developers, so offering this policy will help with recruiting and retention, which, in today's increasingly competitive market for talent, is almost reason enough. David Mytton is founder and CEO of Server Density. ",

    "title": "New York's tech success isn't measured just in IPOs",
    "content": "Recently, VentureBeat published a report about \"New York City's overhyped startup scene,\" an article that used Yext's then-impending IPO to make a case that a lack of flashy IPOs and exits somehow indicated New York's tech and startup environment has not thrived. That couldn't be further from the truth. While New York may lack a blockbuster IPO, it's ridiculous to base an entire city's startup culture and success on IPOs. Other factors to take into account include the success of startups that stayed private while growing significantly, venture capital activity, companies that are ripe for IPOs, job growth, and companies interested in more than just turning a profit. In fact, New York is ranked number two overall in the world for startups after Silicon Valley when it comes to measuring performance, funding, market reach, talent, and startup experience, according to the Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2017 by Startup Genome. Specifically, the report estimates New York now has more than 6,300 startups and an ecosystem value of $74 billion. It also says New York has the fastest average time to hire an engineer of all U.S. cities, at just 24 days, which is astounding. Let's put aside the fact that Yext's IPO was indeed a smashing success and take a closer look at the tech community in NYC. New York is home to some amazing startup and tech companies, many of which are incredibly well respected in the tech world. Tech companies that call New York home include AppNexus, AOL, Casper, DigitalOcean, Etsy, Foursquare, General Assembly, Kickstarter, Meetup, MongoDB, Shutterstock, Sidewalk Labs, Squarespace, Sprinklr, Warby Parker, WeWork, and ZocDoc. On top of that, Silicon Valley-based tech companies that have a significant presence here include Facebook, Google, Snap, and Twitter. New York is well positioned to grow and succeed because of the diversity of the market, with startups in fintech, advertising, healthcare, education, real estate, SaaS, marketplaces, on-demand services, food, IoT, AR/VR, and Bitcoin/Blockchain. This means New York can create the next iteration of just about every vertical. Even more importantly, New York sets itself apart from every other tech I can think of with the diversity of the people who live and work here. Another trait that sets New York apart from other cities is that the companies here are engaged in social and civic issues more so than in many other communities. As Anil Dash wrote in July 2016, \"New York City is unique in that its tech community is grounded in principles of social and civic responsibility. It's an important distinction, one that we've got to work hard to protect and nurture.\" This high level of civic engagement has been apparent in 2017. Earlier this year, New York's tech companies rallied against the Trump administration's immigration travel ban, with more than 2,000 tech workers signing a letter opposing it. In that letter, we proudly wrote that the thriving immigrant community is a \"crucial ingredient that sets New York City apart and a fundamental reason why we have all chosen to build our careers and companies here.\" New York is a great place to do business, and the tech industry is thriving here. Let's not forget that simply because there haven't been many headline-grabbing exits lately. Julie Samuels is the executive director of Tech:NYC, a nonprofit member organization that represents New York City's technology companies. Tech:NYC supports its nearly 500 members by ensuring that New York is the best place to build and grow tech companies. ",

    "title": "Behind Hawaii's push to be a startup paradise",
    "content": "We all know the San Francisco Bay Area is home to Silicon Valley, but a few cities and states around the country are trying to recreate the region's success. In Nebraska, you have Silicon Prairie, then there's Silicon Alley in New York City, Silicon Roundabout in London, and Silicon Beach in Venice, California. Many of these have popped up in just the past few years, and some states are beginning to realize the importance of supporting these new innovation hubs. Among these is one of the most isolated states, geographically speaking: Hawaii. Working with the local community, the government has been pursuing efforts to establish a tech hub that is being dubbed Startup Paradise. During my last visit to Hawaii, I spoke with Governor David Ige and others about the initiative, which is meant to further diversify the Aloha State's industries and retain its talent. Above: Waikiki beach photographed from a Genesis Aviation Helicopter tour. Much of Hawaii's economy is reliant on tourism and hospitality. \"I'm an electrical engineer by profession, a University of Hawai'i [alumnus], and I graduated in that first boom of tech,\" Governor Ige said. \"When I graduated...I had 41 job offers, 40 of them were on the mainland, and they were from everyone. My first time out of state was a job interview with Intel, IBM, and Hewlett Packard in Silicon Valley. So fast forward, once I became a legislator, I was on a mission to create more job opportunities for tech people and engineers...out of five friends in my EE class, four of them went to the mainland and never came back.\" Finding a thriving tech ecosystem in Hawaii is really difficult -- I tried. During my trip, I sought out people I knew to see if maybe there was a startup market that remained relatively off the radar. Though there are accelerators, such as Blue Startups and Elemental Excelerator, and innovation centers, it's rare to see a local startup make it big in Hawaii. But efforts are now being made to change all of that. When I graduated from the University of Hawaii (UH), working in tech didn't seem like a viable option -- the focus was on travel and hospitality at that time. And unlike Stanford, Caltech, MIT, and others, Hawaii's universities are perhaps known for their strong international business and research programs. So how can the state offer its young tech workers and entrepreneurs a reason to remain in Hawaii and contribute to the local economy? During his time in the legislature, Governor Ige wrote all of the state's venture capital laws, including creating the Hawaii Strategic Development Corporation (HSDC), which is tasked with making investments to boost economic development. \"When I started, we had zero venture investments in the state of Hawaii..people weren't interested in making this kind of investment,\" he said. \"We've had great tech successes, when you look at UH and the kind of things that started and evolved here, what should have been and could have been, but there was really no environment. When you talk about the ethernet and the core, it really started at UH. AlohaNet and the Aloha Protocol was really the beginning of TCP/IP -- it's the basic underpinning of the internet. None of it comes back to Hawaii, but it definitely was started here.\" Above: Hawaii Governor David Ige He continued, \"Clearly for me, now as governor, it really is about how we can complete the environment. How can we create opportunities for people so that the electrical engineering graduate from UH today has 40 local job offers and 1 from the mainland? Because that's really what we want. And if you look at our economy from the 30,000 feet level, the hospitality industry is number one. We started this transition in 1950 when we knew that sugars, plantation, and big agriculture growth was limited and we started to think about the next economic driver in our community.\" Above: The Verifone credit card swipe reader was founded in Hawaii. While Hawaii is still largely focused on tourism, some believe diversification is the key to supporting the state's economy, and the governor subscribes to that idea: \"The challenge for us is that we've pretty much hit that ceiling to expand, and creating more jobs in the visitor industry really places too much of a burden on the natural resources that impact the community. So what's the next great job creator for our community? It's about innovation.\" He alluded to how payment tech company Verifone got its start in Hawaii in the 1980s before eventually settling in San Jose, Calif. \"If we had the right ecosystem and they stayed here, that definitely would be a great job creator,\" he said. Make no mistake, there are startups in Hawaii, but there are nowhere near as many as you'd find in cities known for being technology hubs. Startups based on the islands are not necessarily concentrated on consumer applications, but are more in tune with \"non-sexy\" technology fields, such as energy, biotech, and medicine, areas Hawaii is known for. Above: Hawaii-based Blue Startups brought its portfolio companies to San Francisco in 2016 to demo for investors. But, as the governor said, talent is escaping the islands and as people leave, so do the startups. To counter this trend, Hawaii is working to aggregate enough venture capital to incentivize entrepreneurs to stay. Last year, Governor Ige proposed that there should be consistent state investment in private equity and risk capital. He wants to have the HSDC work alongside accelerators and venture funds to invest in projects. \"Yes, it's a big challenge,\" he acknowledged. \"I do think it's about creating an ecosystem...I think it's about creating an environment. I really do believe it's a state of mind. People leave because they believe they have a better shot at being successful by going. I think it's really about getting the startups here and it really takes just one that really commits to staying here. We have a couple of serial entrepreneurs that are committed to Hawaii. To me, that's just as important as getting the equity. I mean, you want those business owners and entrepreneurs to be invested in Hawaii and really want to have their headquarters here.\" Some of the people I spoke with described a less-than-ideal venture capital environment and said that local investors tended to be gun-shy about putting money in unless they can get a mainland firm like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Sequoia Capital, or Andreessen Horowitz to participate. Above: Blue Startups' managing director Chenoa Farnsworth \"It's on us to show the world that we can create that quality, competitive company here. We have to create enough companies [in Hawaii] that a VC will see a pattern or trend,\" said Chenoa Farnsworth, the managing director of Blue Startups, one of the more active startup accelerators in the state. Governor Ige remains optimistic: \"I do think that it's a matter of mindset and if we can nurture enough of these startups and get them to the brink -- and it's really about getting one group of entrepreneurs who said that 'we're going to plant our flag in Hawaii'. And when they're successful, other successes will follow.\" Diversifying a state's economy and moving forward with innovative technologies is definitely easier said than done, as the state has had at least one major stumble in recent history. In 2016, a Maui-based technology fund for early-stage startups, called Mbloom, was shuttered amid allegations that one of the investors engaged in securities fraud and that the fund's initial investments were rife with conflicts of interest. The other major investment party to this was the state, and HSDC moved swiftly to terminate the venture, especially since it was supported by taxpayer money. Hawaii did offer startups tax breaks for doing business in the state some years back, through a law called Act 221. But it was not renewed due to concerns about whether it was really effective. Governor Ige voted in favor of Act 221 when he was a legislator and has previously stated that he believes it was a good law that needed a few tweaks: \"Act 221 could be executed better. When we passed the law, we provided tremendous flexibility to the executive. We had a very broad definition, and we enabled the executive to implement. I believe that part of the challenges and the controversy truly was a result of poor decision-making on execution,\" he explained. Above: Governor David Ige While in his first term as the state's chief executive, the governor has also proposed establishing a $30 million innovation fund, setting aside money from corporate tax revenues over six years to support startups. First announced in his 2016 State of the State address, Governor Ige revealed that he had submitted legislation that would take $5 million each year for five consecutive years. The money would go into a strategic fund that would be co-invested with a private provider. \"What we're trying to do is commit a steady flow of income that would allow [the fund investors] to begin to program and set up relationships so they can create a sustained kind of investment pool,\" he explained. \"It would be $30 million over the next six years that they can count on. I'm pretty confident that in six years, we'll be able to prove success, that we'll be able to convince the other legislators to...make bigger investments.\" Above: Hawaii's Governor David Ige gives his State of the State address in 2016. During this year's State of the State address, Governor Ige touted the impact of innovation, announcing that 145 startups have gone through six accelerator programs, receiving $10 million in venture capital and generating more than $250 million in total capital. \"That's why the budget includes additional funds for the Hi Growth program,\" he said in prepared remarks. While the state executive and community organizations are behind this diversification effort, how does the general public feel about their taxes being used to boost tech companies? Governor Ige is bullish, telling VentureBeat, \"I think that many of us who are residents see the same challenges. Our economy is doing great. Our unemployment is among the lowest in the country. The hospitality industry generates a lot of jobs, but they are living wage jobs. If you look at the median home price at $700,000, a lot of those jobs generated by the visitor industry would [make it] tough to be able to live here.\" As for the business community, he said: \"I think they get it. I have three children and they're all in school. What decisions do we make today to give them the best opportunity to call Hawaii home, to be able to have them graduate and find a challenging and enticing job opportunity in Hawaii that pays them a living wage and allows them to purchase a home so they can choose to call Hawaii home? I think for me, and many of those in our community, it really is about how we can create these opportunities.\" Above: Hawaii Governor Ige at the 2017 STEM conference. What Governor Ige, Farnsworth, and others in Hawaii are attempting isn't new -- others in the state have tried to establish a startup community of sorts. In 2012, the governor's predecessor, Neil Abercrombie, signed into law HB2319, which would appropriate $2 million for a venture accelerator funding program. It was under Abercrombie that the aforementioned Hi Growth program, a state-sanctioned program to engage with the private sector, was created. In 2013, then-Governor Abercrombie proposed providing $20 million in funding to focus on \"the critical building blocks of research commercialization, entrepreneur mentoring, and the mobilization of startup investment capital.\" But while efforts have been made before now, the question is what it will take to make a real dent on the startup ecosystem. \"I've lived [innovation] and kind of understand how it works. I see the ups and downs in it,\" Governor Ige said. \"I understand how when it's other people making investment, it's about the money. So how do we create private equity and risk capital in Hawaii that believes in Hawaii?\" \"It's so funny how at one point in time, green companies were an outlier. People thought: 'Who cares if your policies are green or if your company takes care of itself?' Today, you can't be a successful company if you're not green,\" he continued. \"What we're looking to create are companies that are truly doing the right things in the right way in every step of the way. These are the kind of companies that we want to build.\" To attract talent, startups, and investors, Governor Ige is backing the Startup Paradise initiative that was put forth by the local community and HSDC. As the name suggests, Hawaii believes that its real appeal lies in its being...well, Hawaii. The program also focuses on technological innovation, job growth, and economic strategies aimed at helping the state rival the tech hubs in other markets. Above: Manoa Innovation Center in Honolulu. Hawaii is home to some of the companies participating in Startup Paradise. As of 2016, it was reported that 60 percent of the 145 startups participating in the program were based in Hawaii, and 78 percent of those are still operational. Nearly 40 percent of those participating in Startup Paradise are involved in software services, while 32 percent are in energy technology. The remaining startups deal with media (11 percent), hardware (6 percent), agriculture (6 percent), and life science or health care (5 percent). \"Most people think that they can start [in Hawaii], but if I really want to make it, I got to go [to Silicon Valley]. It's really about creating the support structure so that [entrepreneurs] have the capacity to choose to stay here,\" Governor Ige explained. \"Once we can get the one or two breakthroughs, then I think it'll be like a dam bursting. People, given the choice, will want to live in Hawaii. If their business can be successful, they'll choose here.\" He doesn't think Silicon Valley should have a monopoly on startups. \"Nothing can be harder than Silicon Valley. Hawaii is a piece of cake compared to Silicon Valley, but Silicon Valley thrives. Why is that? It's about the people. It's about the human resource in the innovation economy that's the most important resource.\" \"I believe our environment gives us a competitive advantage because that human resource wants to be in Hawaii,\" Governor Ige said, echoing statements that have been previously reported. \"It's about really changing the paradigm for our young entrepreneurs to show that, yes indeed, it can happen in Hawaii. And we're going to create that ecosystem that supports them and that we're going to be working really hard to make sure that they have a pathway if they want to start a company in Hawaii, that we're going to provide them support they need to get the second, third, or fourth round [of funding] and that big expansion,\" he said. Above: Hawaii Governor David Ige meets with students at the University of Hawaii College of Engineering banquet. Major stakeholders concede that this is a long-term endeavor and that the current ecosystem is young, but they also see that it is growing and has potential. \"Communities and cultures are not built overnight, and startup communities are no exception,\" explained Dawn Lippert, a director at Elemental Excelerator, in a 2014 interview. Rather than going head-to-head with every other technology hub around the world, Hawaii is opting to focus on a select group of clusters, areas where the state holds a competitive advantage. The state has pledged to support 100 percent renewable energy, ethnic and cultural diversity, biomedical and pharmaceutical research, Hawaii's cancer center, and hospitality and tourism. Is Governor Ige worried about any negative impact of innovation, such as gentrification and people being priced out of their home, things that have plagued cities such as San Francisco? He acknowledges the risk, but said: \"It's about changing the trajectory of Hawaii: What is it that we want? We want to support the innovators and creators that are committed to what's special about Hawaii. It's really about the integration of the host culture...celebrating diversity. I believe that Hawaii is the best place to raise kids and a family, bar none. So how do we keep it going?\" Above: Hawaii Governor David Ige signs order instructing departments to submit documents using an electronic routing form template. As part of that vision, the governor is in favor of disruptive technologies, even those that have run afoul of regulators, such as Uber and Airbnb: \"Uber is successful and the traditional business guys want to shut them down because their platform, their technology, and business model is so different from the existing. But the flip side is that their business models respond exactly to the concerns that the traditional business lived with and built...\" \"So yes, it is disruptive,\" he said, \"and yes, we don't want to clamp down and regulate them in the traditional sense. So how do we create an environment that is flexible? From a government side, that's a challenge for us. I've challenged my cabinet to reinvent government to be flexible and innovate itself. How do we make sure that we don't apply the same old regulatory tendencies onto these new areas? I'm not exactly certain, but I've encouraged the cabinet to think outside the box and encourage employees to not be close-minded and to think differently. I'm committed.\" As governor, Ige has also vetoed a bill that required online lodging services such as Airbnb to collect state and local taxes. \"It's really about creating a vibrant innovation economy so that we can have the investment capital and we can find and grow the innovators here in our community that understand what it means to be in Hawaii, why it's special, and why we have to take care of the environment, be respectful, and to celebrate the host culture, and celebrate our differences...Once we've gotten that first success, the rest of that will happen,\" he said.

    "title": "Where are all the big telecom mergers?",
    "content": "The much-anticipated merger mania in the communications industry finally turned into a real deal this week, but it probably wasn't the one most people were expecting. Verizon outbid AT&T with a $3.1 billion offer for tiny wireless startup Straight Path Communications, which owns airwave rights suitable for super-fast 5G networks coming in a few years. Meanwhile, almost all of the much larger anticipated deals have suffered symbolic setbacks, with the exception of one. Early on Friday, Bloomberg reported that Sprint and T-Mobile had started preliminary merger talks, though no investment banks had gotten involved yet. Both companies declined to comment to Fortune. Whether the two sides can come to an agreement is an open question, and the stock price of both companies barely budged. Shares of Sprint, which have declined 6% so far this year, gained 1% on Friday while shares of T-Mobile, which have gained 14% in 2017, lost 0.4%. Of course, Masayoshi Son, CEO of Sprint majority owner SoftBank Group, tried to buy T-Mobile  in 2014 but was effectively blocked by Obama administration regulators. Antitrust enforcement will likely be less severe in the Trump administration, but shrinking the fiercely competitive wireless market from four major carriers to three may still represent too much consolidation. And some Wall Street analysts say the math of a deal has become unworkable because T-Mobile's value has grown so much larger than Sprint since they last tried to combine. Meanwhile, many of the other expected players in the next wave of telecom consolidation seems to be backing away from the dealmaking table. After a few weeks of conflicting signals, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam gave Wall Street a steadier message on Monday, disavowing any rush to make a deal. \"The bottom line is we don't feel the urgency that seems to be out there in the analyst community, the banking community, and the media,\" McAdam said at an analyst meeting. Verizon has been a rumored buyer of Dish Network, the satellite TV service that owns tons of spectrum rights, as well as a possible merger partner with major cable providers Comcast or Charter. Shares of Dish, which have 6% this year, were about unchanged on the week, as where shares of Comcast, which have gained 13% year to date. Charter shares, which are up 12% for the year, took the news hardest, dropping 4%. Comcast and Charter have lately been getting into the wireless business, prompting speculation one of them might buy T-Mobile or Sprint. But on Monday, they announced a partnership to share wireless technology that included a ban on either company making its own major acquisition or merger in the space for one year. Although the agreement left room for a rare joint acquisition of a wireless carrier, most analysts saw the provision as a sign that mergers were off the table for now. \"Where does this leave us,\" Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson asked in a report on Monday. \"Well, with a lot fewer speculative deals to speculate about in the speculative game of deal speculation.\" The arrangement did set off a whole new avenue of speculation around whether the two cable giants themselves might be contemplating combining under the seemingly laxer Trump regime. That prompted a sharp tweet about Monday's agreement from public advocacy lawyer Harold Feld, who has opposed many media mergers. \"Doesn't this violate antitrust laws? Do we even still have antitrust laws?\" This story originally appeared on Fortune.com. Copyright 2017 ",

    "title": "Voice or text for bots? It's all about context",
    "content": "In 2016, Facebook took the bot world by storm when it opened up its Messenger platform to developers. Then came Amazon's voice-controlled Alexa, and the hype shifted towards all things voice. So noticeable was the shift that New York-based startup studio Betaworks rebranded its popular Botcamp event from last year to Voicecamp this year. The integration of bots into our daily lives is really just getting started, so for brands and marketers joining the journey, the hyperdynamic, often polarizing views on which type of bot is best can be confusing. Should you build a voice bot or a text bot? On which platform should your brand invest to deploy its first conversational experience? Like the bots themselves, the answer is both elegantly simple and complex. Derived from the concept of \"persona,\" Canadian computer scientist and researcher Bill Buxton introduced the idea of a \"placeona\" (place-ona) to capture how location can influence which types of interactive technology it makes sense for people to use. Borrowing from Des Traynor's brilliant post on the topic, let's look at these three scenarios: In the first scenario, the platform of choice would be voice. In the second scenario, text would be more appropriate. In the third scenario, either voice or text would work. That's a key point to make: Bots should not compete against each other, but work together to create a unified, seamless, delightful user experience that creates value for whichever context a user might be in. The nature of your brand also dictates which platform you should invest in. A chatbot from Kotex aimed at girls in need of advice on handling their first period, for example, would be better received with the privacy of a text bot. Plus, maybe that interaction happens on Kik instead of Messenger, since that's where most American teens spend their time. On the other hand, cooking tips sponsored by Campbell's might be better suited to a voice bot, which can deliver the preparation directives when your hands are dirty. It's all about putting the user first and adapting or placing your offering appropriately, for maximum effectiveness. In the end, you shouldn't try to change customers' behavior, but rather leverage existing behavior, adapting your approach to suit the context. That's how your brand will thrive in the messaging age. When in the comfort of their homes or their cars, people tend to feel at ease with voice-activated interfaces. When in public, people would rather enjoy the privacy of their phone, where they can text each other or send messages to brands in a bidirectional, asynchronous, and silent way. As the Kotex example illustrates, the private nature of some conversations is key to unlocking the kind of utility and value that customers are looking for. That's also how you can bond and foster deep, meaningful relationships with your audience over time. Respecting the pace of play of customers is the golden rule for brand marketers who want to design stellar virtual assistants. Choosing the right platform is the first critical step in joining the conversation. Etienne Merineau is cofounder and head of conversation design at Heyday.ai, a chatbot development platform for brands. Above: The Machine Intelligence Landscape.

    "title": "Outgoing French president will move his foundation to Paris' Station F mega-campus",
    "content": "New French president Emmanuel Macron will take office this weekend. But the country's soon-to-be-former-president, Francois Hollande, apparently isn't going far. Hollande, whose administration launched La French Tech program to accelerate France's startup economy, has announced he will move his foundation to Paris' Station F, the startup campus that will open this summer as a home for more than 1,000 startups. Hollande's foundation, La France s'engage, funds social innovation startups to help address challenges ranging from unemployment to agriculture to education to the environment. Launched more than two years ago, the foundation has funded 77 nonprofits working on various social innovation projects. At Station F, he'll be surrounded by a buzzing hive of startup activity when the campus opens this summer. Read More: Inside the construction of Paris' Station F: The landmark campus for 1,000 startups Funded by French telecom entrepreneur Xavier Niel, the ambitious project aims to attract 1,000 startups to its $265 million campus, a renovated historic train station in the heart of Paris. In recent weeks, Station F has been announcing partnerships with high-profile names, including incubators sponsored by Facebook and Zendesk, a travel perk offered by Airbnb, and office space for Amazon mentorships. In the most recent announcement, Station F also noted that Silicon Valley's Plug and Play will open a fintech and insurance tech accelerator. The campus is also adding a medtech incubator and an incubator for Franco-Chinese startups. Station F will have three sections: a space with 3,000 desks for startups, an event space for conferences and meetings, and a retail zone for the public that will include four kitchens and a bar open 24 hours a day. The mix of tenants will also include venture capital firms, a fab lab hacker space, and several corporate partners. As part of the project, Station F is also redeveloping two nearby buildings that will offer subsidized housing for 600 people who are in some way connected to the campus. The first group of tenants is expected to move in by early July, which is interesting timing given that it coincides with the start of summer holidays in France. Much of the country is shut down for August holidays. Here's Hollande speaking at Station F, in case you want to get your French on: ",

    "title": "Bing now serves up bots from Facebook Messenger, Slack, and other chat apps",
    "content": "Thousands of Facebook Messenger, Slack, Skype, Kik, and Telegram bots can now be found by searching Bing.com, a source familiar with the matter has informed VentureBeat. Bots in dozens of categories, including travel, entertainment, sports, and news, can be surfaced by entering a phrase like \"travel bots\" or \"entertainment bots\" into the search box on Bing.com. When Bing surfaces bot search results, each chat app platform is displayed in a dedicated area at the top of the results. Search for bots on Bing today and you'll find that the selection of highlighted bots may not be the very best bots available, but it's a start and is far more extensive than anything currently offered by other chat apps. Bots can either be viewed by individual platform or as an aggregate to display the best bots from all five bot platforms. At Build 2017, alongside a stream of news about AI, bots, and Cortana, Microsoft yesterday announced that Skype bots can now be found in Bing search results. Bots from multiple platforms have actually been part of Bing search results in some capacity for months now, and more bots and chat platforms may be added in the future, said the source, who asked to remain anonymous. A desire to create a common bot search engine is an ambition Lili Cheng, general manager of FUSE Labs at Microsoft Research, first shared with VentureBeat last fall. Cheng, who may be one of the most influential players in the space, has been a driving force behind the bot craze of the past year or so, having worked on projects ranging from the infamous Tay to new customizable cognitive services to bringing together bot startups and chat platform stakeholders in the Botness group. Above: News bot search results on Bing.com Echoing requests from developers making bots for Facebook Messenger, Cheng said the biggest request she got from users of the Microsoft Bot Framework was to improve discoverability. Talk about a bot search engine has included partners like Slack and Facebook Messenger, Cheng said. \"There are just a lot of bot developers who, like us, just want our bots to be discoverable, and they're sort of at the mercy of each channel,\" she told VentureBeat. \"So we were thinking that we could use search. And then [being able] to try them out there on the web is really cool.\" In other news from Build 2017, the Microsoft Bot Framework, which is now used by more than 130,000 developers, got a series of new features, including the ability to make payments and to publish bots to Skype for Business, Bing, and Cortana. The Cortana Skills Kit is now publicly available, with roughly 50 skills that can teach you how to make a Manhattan, order a pizza, or take care of a child. Customizable artificial intelligence services developed out of Microsoft Research, as well as Skype video bots and Skype chat for web pages, were also announced. ",

    "title": "U.S. court rejects Uber's call for private hearing in trade secrets case brought by Alphabet",
    "content": "(Reuters) -- A U.S. judge on Thursday called for an investigation into allegations of trade secret theft that were raised in a court battle between Silicon Valley giants Uber and Alphabet over their rival self-driving car programs. U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco also partially granted Alphabet's self-driving Waymo unit's bid for an injunction against Uber's self-driving efforts, and rejected Uber's arguments that Waymo's trade secret allegations should proceed in private arbitration. The rulings are a setback for Uber as it tries to gain an advantage in litigation with serious strategic and financial consequences in the nascent field of autonomous technology. The ride services company failed to remove the ongoing case from public view and now faces the prospect of getting caught up in a fresh criminal probe. The acrimonious trade secrets battle could determine the future of Uber's self-driving car operations and the strength of Waymo's toehold in the sector. Alsup filed his injunction opinion temporarily under seal, so its scope and details could not immediately be learned. The case hinges on over 14,000 confidential files that Waymo, formerly Google's self-driving car program, alleges were stolen by former Waymo employee Anthony Levandowski before he left the company. Levandowski, who is not a defendant in the civil case, subsequently co-founded self-driving truck start-up Otto that was acquired months later by Uber. Waymo claims the stolen information made its way into Uber's Lidar system, a sensor that uses light pulses to \"see\" the environment. It alleges the documents allowed Uber to fast-track its own technology and avoid years of costly research. In referring the case to the U.S. Department of Justice for investigation of possible trade secret theft, Alsup said he took \"no position\" on whether a criminal prosecution was warranted. In his arbitration ruling, however, the judge noted the record contained \"ample evidence\" that Levandowski breached his duty of loyalty to Waymo. Uber declined to comment on Alsup's request for a separate criminal investigation into the theft allegations. In a statement the company said \"we remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology.\" Uber has not denied that Levandowski took Waymo's documents, but says they never made their way to Uber, nor into its own designs. Representatives for the Justice Department could not immediately be reached for comment, nor could attorneys for Levandowski. The engineer has not commented publicly on the allegations. Reuters reported last week that the Justice Department had begun a separate criminal investigation into Uber's use of a software tool that helped its drivers evade local transportation regulators. In a statement, Waymo said Uber's bid to have the civil case heard in private by an arbitrator, not a jury, was a \"desperate\" attempt to avoid the court's jurisdiction. Unlike court proceedings, which are largely conducted in public, arbitrations take place behind closed doors. Because Levandowski was not a defendant in the case, Uber could not use his arbitration agreement with Waymo to force the trade secret claims into a private forum, Alsup wrote. The Alphabet unit asked Alsup to issue an injunction preventing Uber from using Waymo's trade secrets, and Levandowski from working on Lidar. Complicating Uber's task is the fact that Levandowski has invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination and has refused to testify. Alsup wrote that Levandowski's position \"has obstructed and continues to obstruct both discovery and defendants' ability to construct a complete narrative as to the fate of Waymo's purloined files.\" Uber had already announced that Levandowski would step aside from working on Lidar while the case was being litigated, and said the company would agree to a court injunction that formalized that arrangement. However, Waymo sought a broader injunction that would prevent Uber from using a series of its trade secrets. (Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Stephen Coates) ",

    "title": "Uber hires logistics brokers to continue push into trucking",
    "content": "(Reuters) - Uber hired the team behind a Chicago transportation brokerage last fall as part of an effort to break into the long-haul trucking industry. All five employees from 4Front Logistics joined Uber in November, said an Uber spokeswoman, who added that Uber did not pay anything for the company. Brokerages such as 4Front Logistics connect manufacturers and retailers that are shipping goods with truck owners and fleets. The deal comes as Uber is vying to apply the logistics expertise it has gained ferrying passengers in countries around the world to the trucking industry. That strategy puts it in the middle of a large, highly fragmented industry of freight brokers who match cargo with truck operators. Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick posted a photo on Twitter on Sunday of a large white truck emblazoned with the words \"Uber Freight.\" In one of Uber's first public displays of its interest in trucking, Uber last August acquired self-driving truck startup Otto for $680 million, a deal that is now at the center of a legal battle with Alphabet's Waymo. Since launching its push into trucking about a year ago, Uber has been steadily gaining traction, said transportation analyst Jack Atkins of investment bank Stephens Inc. \"They are being very active building up their scale in the brokerage market, both in terms of going after customers but also making sure they have the capacity to fulfill that,\" he said. Uber, along with Otto, has over the past several months acquired a fleet of its own trucks to test its technology, pitched its services to independent truck owners and trucking associations, and built out a host of other technologies involving mapping and tracking, which are part of the logistics package for trucking. As Silicon Valley aims to ease logistics in entrenched industries, a host of startups have rushed into trucking, a $700 billion-a-year industry that is notorious for low margins. Despite its small size, 4Front will help Uber build capacity, said Ivan Tsybaev, chief executive of Trucker Path, a startup that has built a popular navigation app for truckers. \"It's really hard to scale fast, even with Uber's resources,\" he said. 4Front Logistics was granted a broker license for moving freight across state lines in March 2016 by the U.S. Department of Transportation, according to the DOT database. That license was revoked last month. The reason is unclear, but a DOT spokesman said most often revocation is the result of companies not providing proof of insurance. Uber was granted a DOT broker license for its Uber Freight business at the end of September. Otto has been registered with the DOT and with the California Department of Motor Vehicles to haul freight as a carrier - not a broker - since last year.

    "title": "Data-first tools score $1.8 billion to make US workers super-productive",
    "content": "At my firm, Wing, we recently completed a research report looking at the young companies pioneering AI-powered \"data-first\" applications, and there is a lot of important activity happening in this space. Collectively, these startups have raised $1.8 billion of venture capital to pursue their goal of disrupting the $150 billion-plus market for enterprise applications. In the same way robotic exoskeletons greatly increase the strength of their human operators, these software equivalents can help workers achieve far more than they can with existing applications. The range of areas being addressed by this new generation of software is growing fast. Gong and Chorus, for example, are startups using natural language processing and other AI technologies to analyze sales conversations, highlighting ways to make sales teams more effective. ClearMetal is applying machine learning to data about ship movements, port conditions, and other factors to help supply chain managers better predict the availability and cost of containers. Other young companies like Prevedere and TravelBank are leveraging AI technologies to help executives improve financial forecasts and expense management. The original business software paradigm pioneered by companies such as Oracle and SAP focused on using software to boost efficiency by codifying workflows. The data generated by the applications were treated as an afterthought. If insights were needed to guide workers, analysts were summoned to extract them from the data using specialized tools. The Software-as-a-Service revolution greatly improved the way business software was delivered and distributed, but it didn't fundamentally change this underlying approach. The new applications do. They treat data as the priority -- hence the term \"data-first\" -- and they leverage various AI technologies to recommend actions that are delivered directly to users, often in real time. Incumbents like Oracle are now rushing to inject AI features into their software. But as so often in the history of technology, many of the most compelling innovations will come from startups unencumbered by legacy thinking. Startups like Signifyd, which just raised $56 million of fresh funding to develop its anti-fraud application, are focusing on key online processes like fraud detection, ad targeting, and consumer offer optimization, where the sheer volume and velocity of decision-making is so high it's impossible to have humans in the loop. Using AI technologies to automate all or most of the work makes sense here. Elsewhere, as our report notes, the emphasis is more on augmentation than automation. This is especially true in sensitive areas like IT security and IT operations, where a tsunami of events and alerts risks overwhelming human operators. Here, AI-powered software is being used to identify situations that merit the attention of an employee and to automate responses to some issues. For example, Moogsoft (in which my firm is an investor) has enabled one of its financial services clients using its \"AIOps\" platform to boost the number of servers an IT operations team member can monitor effectively from just over 1,000 to over 10,000. Data-first applications are also helping to increase employee productivity in other sensitive areas like customer support. DigitalGenius applies deep learning algorithms to historical customer service transcripts and can generate automated responses to new queries or suggest ones for call center agents to use. By analyzing inbound queries and ensuring they are routed to the right teams, DigitalGenius claims it can increase agent capacity by around 30 percent. As a recent New York Times story trumpeted, hiring is up, wages are up, and jobless rates are at a 10-year low. As the labor market continues to tighten in America, companies need to find innovative new ways to boost the productivity of their employees. Those that fail to adopt data-first applications will leave their employees at a distinct disadvantage. Those that want to be in the vanguard will need to evaluate next-generation software applications quickly. Some of the criteria against which to assess them include: As they penetrate more companies and business functions, data-first applications will inevitably find themselves swept up in the debate about whether AI-driven automation is going to destroy large numbers of jobs. Yet in most cases, the new applications' role will be to automate basic tasks and help employees become more productive as they are freed up to focus on more value-added activities. This ability to act as a force multiplier for humans will become even more valuable as ageing populations place a greater burden on remaining workers to drive future economic growth. As a society, we'll need to think carefully about the implications of software-driven automation in certain sectors of the economy. But the direction of change is clear. The companies and executives that are most adept at building machine-assisted workforces will be the ones that come out on top in the emerging era of AI-driven competition.

    "title": "Why your next malware infection might be AI-controlled",
    "content": "The race to create genuine artificial intelligence (AI) is blazing ahead at a nonstop pace. From devices that recognize voice commands to realistic robocall scams, AI technology gets smarter with every passing year. And while many of these advances do serve to improve daily life and convenience, not all developers have the best of intentions. If progress continues at the current rate, artificially intelligent malware -- smart programs designed to steal or corrupt data while learning how to avoid detection or eradication -- could soon become a reality. Cybersecurity is already serious business. There was a 64 percent increase in cybersecurity incidents in 2015, affecting over 17 million U.S. residents. And there's a reason for this uptick in cybercrime: Hackers make some serious cash. As such, criminals have a vested interest in making increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, no matter the cost. Intelligent malware would be an incredibly dangerous tool in the hands of criminals. Even the simplest applications of smart malware could be disastrous for individuals and corporations worldwide. Unintelligent viruses and malware can be difficult enough to get rid of; smart, adaptable malware that can learn from the programs trying to remove them are on an entirely different level. If those programs were levied against government-level infrastructures, the results could be catastrophic. And then there's the fact that AI-powered malware doesn't need much human involvement to work. These intelligent programs can work around the clock to break into a network -- without the need for a coffee break or nap. As Ofer Israeli, founder and CEO of Illusive Networks, points out, \"A major difference with AI-driven malware is that it has the potential to move faster within the network.\" So once a smart program has breached security, it can do a lot more damage in a much shorter amount of time. That's a lot of potential damage coming from a little bit of code. Yet as scary as this all sounds, there's a bit of good news: Truly sophisticated intelligent malware isn't yet \"happening in the wild,\" according to Bryan Gale, VP of product marketing at Cylance. The technology behind artificial intelligence is still in its relative infancy, and most iterations still need human prodding to function properly. If you need proof of the current limits of AI, just try asking your smartphone assistant to do anything more complex than play a song. Those current limits don't mean the possibility should be entirely discounted, however. Though security experts aren't seeing a lot of well-developed threats, some basic programs -- precursors to truly smart systems -- are already showing up on the scene. \"Simple iterations of 'thinking' malware have already arrived, but are reserved for the elite nation states,\" said Chris Gerritz, founder of the malware-hunting company Infocyte. \"Some networks ... do not have connections to the internet, so [spies] program malware to jump the air gap through USB hard drives (or USB sticks), do its thing (search, steal, propagate), and return to an internet-connected device, hopefully via the next USB stick insertion.\" It isn't surprising that these simple types of malware are reserved for elite nation states. Even unintelligent malware is expensive to create and run on a large scale -- it can cost up to $20,000. As long as the tech is new, it won't come cheap. And that's a very good thing for the majority of the world, because it means malicious parties won't have easy access to the tech just yet. Taking advantage of this calm before the storm, the cybersecurity world is harnessing the power of AI to combat threats before malicious programs become more prevalent or accessible. In a lot of ways, the future of cybersecurity depends on anti-malware programs getting smart sooner than the malware programs themselves. If the malicious programs hit the turning point first, it'll be a lot tougher for security entities to catch up. Luckily, there have already been a few breakthroughs. \"AI-type algorithms are being produced that can identify malware that has never been seen before,\" Gerritz says. This type of intelligence begins to learn and understand malicious code and software in real time for the purpose of stopping an attack as it's happening. Interestingly, much of the development around malware protection is happening in the startup arena. Illusive Networks, which was recently backed by Microsoft Ventures, works to preemptively contaminate the data that malware is after. Cylance, listed as a Top 50 Startup to Watch by business network Built in LA, is developing AI to predict malware behaviors. And Infocyte takes a different approach by actively hunting down cyberthreats through smart technologies. These small companies and other cybersecurity startups could become very big players against the cyberthreats of the future. And though the fight against intelligent malware has just begun, we can expect to see a slew of bright young businesses prepared for the battle.

Jeff Herbst, vice president of business development, said that Nvidia wants to partner with venture capitalists to fund even more AI startups that will build out the necessary parts of the ecosystem for AI, which is expected to become a huge part of the technology landscape going forward. He said the doors are open to partnering because there are so many more startups than Nvidia can help or finance on its own. Nvidia held a lunch on Thursday at its GPU Technology Conference to enlist dozens of venture capitalists in its crusade to change the world through artificial intelligence. Five startups made presentations to the VCs during the lunch, and Herbst spoke with Jim McHugh, general manager of Nvidia's deep learning group, about the trends that will create opportunities for AI startups in the future. Above: Jeff Herbst of Nvidia \"Every meaningful startup is using a GPU in some form now,\" Herbst said. \"Every relevant AI company comes through us. We are at the center of the revolution. We can be a great source of deal flow\" for venture capitalists. Nvidia also launched its Tesla V100 AI processors today, which has 21 billion transistors and is about three times as powerful as the chip that Nvidia launched a year ago. McHugh said that it's amazing to see a chip platform move so fast and stay ahead of Moore's Law, the prediction that chip performance will double every couple of years as the number of transistors double every couple of years. But he thinks that startups in particular will benefit from the Nvidia DGX Station, which essentially lets startups get started on AI processing right away. Nvidia is a strategic investor, and it has invested in about 15 of the 1,300 startups in its Inception program. But there are more AI startups than Nvidia can invest in, and it wants to keep investing in companies that find a new way to use Nvidia's GPUs. Jay Eum, managing director at Translink Capital, said he thought the idea of partnering with strategic investors was a good one because they can open so many doors for startups. During the session, VCs heard presentations from five AI startups: Datalogue (automating data preparation), Drive.ai (building the brain of self-driving cars), Fastdata.io (using GPUs to accelerate streaming data), MapD (accelerating SQL database processing with GPUs), and SoundHound (a leader in voice-enabled AI). MapD recently closed a $25 million round led by NEA, and it has open-sourced its platform. Herbst said that Nvidia has three more investments in the pipeline. Nvidia plans to have more GPU Ventures events in the future. \"We are enabling the software ecosystem around our platform,\" Herbst said. \"It's a platform focus. Don't think of us as guys in Cupertino, Santa Clara, and San Diego. We are completely different. We are financial investors, but we are primarily strategic investors.\" ",

    "title": "Nectar Labs brings smart liquor tracking to the bar business",
    "content": "When a bartender pours too much liquor in a drink, or someone slips away with a bottle, it can take a toll on a drinking establishment's bottom line. So Nectar Labs has come up with a solution: the connected pourer and stopper. It uses ultrasound technology and a software platform to precisely measure how much alcohol is left in a given bottle for automating inventory, managing shrinkage (theft or loss) and self-replenishing. Nectar says it literally puts a cap on the multi-billion dollar lost revenue crisis that impacts any business with a bar. The Distilled Spirits Council trade group estimates that the bar business is worth $200 billion a year worldwide, and shrinkage is as much as $50 billion a year. For $300 a month, Nectar supplies the hardware and an app to help companies enforce rules against \"heavy pours.\" The platform is live and is managing more than 100,000 live pours in the W Hotel in Miami and Dosa Restaurant in San Francisco. The company invested more than 50,000 hours of research and development time into the product, which includes more than 2.5 million pours using custom robotic arms in its lab to test for accuracy and durability. (Yes, somebody has been doing a lot of drinking). \"Nectar has delivered powerful insights that were impossible to identify before, said Anjan Mitra, owner of Dosa restaurant, in a statement. \"These have dramatically improved our operations, ranging from 24/7 inventory management to one-touch ordering, so our bar managers don't work after hours to keep in-demand liquor in stock. Instead, they can focus on delivering the best possible guest experience and creating amazing cocktails.\" Above: Nectar Labs' app keeps track of what has been poured. The Nectar cap transfers data wirelessly to an app via Bluetooth. Nectar's caps and associated platform are designed to seamlessly fit a bar's current operation. The pourer and stopper continuously communicates with the app, keeping track of inventory in real time. When a bottle is finished and replaced, Nectar automatically depletes it from inventory, and when inventory is running low, orders can be placed directly with distributors. That saves bar managers time and money so they can focus on customer experience instead of the stock room. \"Nectar is doing for alcohol consumption data what Google did for click-through data. By bringing disciplined metrics to a previously unmeasured space, Nectar is closing the massive information gap to make the bar industry more intelligent and efficient,\" said Aayush Phumbhra, cofounder and CEO of Nectar, in a statement. \"With sell-through data available in real time, and self-replenishment a reality, Nectar will improve the unit economics of the industry.\" Phumbhra and cofounder Prabhanjan \"PJ\" Gurumohan, chief operating officer, have more than 20 years of consumer experience. \"Until now, precise inventory control and management have been guesswork. It's insanely difficult to track how much bars and restaurants serve -- and lose -- on a given night, let alone over a month or a year,\" said Gurumohan, in a statement. \"Nectar's technology tackles this global, multi-billion dollar problem by seamlessly integrating into a bar's existing operations. It's accurate, non-invasive, and doesn't force the bartender to change how they do their job.\" Phumbhra cofounded Chegg, the disruptive solution to expensive textbook purchases, and evolved the company from a boot-strapped startup to a multi-million dollar publicly traded digital learning platform. Gurumohan was the cofounder and CEO of Genwi, one of the largest cloud publishing solutions, and one which is used by more than 1,500 customers, including Conde Nast, Forbes, and PBS. Nectar is currently taking orders for future shipments of its connected pourers and stoppers. The company was founded in 2014, and its investors include Palantir cofounder and venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale; Eclipse founder Lior Susan; founder of Streamlined Ventures, Ullas Naik; and others. The company has under 20 employees. ",

    "title": "Microsoft launches Xamarin Live Player preview for debugging Android and iOS apps without SDKs or emulators",
    "content": "At its Build 2017 developer conference, Microsoft today released Xamarin Live Player in preview. The company called the tool \"a live coding environment,\" which essentially means developers can build, test, and debug apps without having to install SDKs or emulators. You can install the Live Player extensions for both Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2017 for Mac right now and download the Xamarin Live Player apps from Google Play and Apple's App Store. Here's another way to look at Xamarin Live Player. Developers can already build for Android using Windows or Mac. Developing for iOS, however, requires a Mac. Xamarin Live Player removes that requirement and instead asks you for an iPhone and Visual Studio 2017 for Windows.  Microsoft acquired mobile app development company Xamarin in February 2016. The following month, the company integrated Xamarin into Visual Studio for free. But that doesn't mean Xamarin isn't still cranking out new features and services. Xamarin Live Player allows developers to simply download an Android or iOS app and start coding. All you need is Visual Studio and a physical Android or iOS device. There is no need to install SDKs and emulators to get started -- just download an app, pair your device with Visual Studio by scanning a QR code, and hit \"debug\" like you normally would.  The app will be deployed to Xamarin Live Player in the background, enabling you to develop and test your changes without having to recompile and redeploy the app. You can set break points and debug your app, on device and over the air. There's even a Live Run Current View mode that lets you modify your C# or XAML code so that the current view is redeployed as you develop. Microsoft may have bought Xamarin to integrate its developer tools, but, at least for now, the company is still letting those employees push the limits like they did at the startup. ",

    "title": "Vivid Vision raises $2.2 million to build VR tools to treat 'lazy eye'",
    "content": "Startup Vivid Vision said today it has raised $2.2 million in a seed round to build VR tools that could be used to treat eye problems known as \"lazy eye.\" San Francisco-based Vivid Vision raised the money from SoftTech VC's Jeff Clavier, as well as The Venture Reality Fund (The VR Fund), CRCM Ventures, SOS Ventures, Anorak Ventures, and Liquid 2 Ventures, a seed-stage venture capital firm cofounded by Hall of Fame NFL quarterback Joe Montana. The company's VR treatment for binocular vision disorders is now available at more than 90 clinics across the world. More than 10 percent of Americans suffer from one or more binocular vision disorders, such as amblyopia, strabismus, or convergence insufficiency. These disorders, commonly known as \"lazy eye\" and \"crossed eyes,\" can cause issues with driving and playing sports, and can even limit career choices. They also greatly impact one's quality of life -- even getting in the way of personal relationships and sometimes leading to social stigma. Above: Vivid Vision can help fix lazy eye. Founded in 2014, Vivid Vision is a medical technology company applying virtual reality to the field of vision care. Its founder and CEO, James Blaha, a programmer and lifelong sufferer of lazy eye, started the company after experimenting on himself. Before building the first prototype, Blaha couldn't read with his weak eye or see in 3D. Since then, the vision in Blaha's weak eye has improved to nearly 20/20. His experiments gathered worldwide attention, and Vivid Vision launched its clinical vision therapy suite in late 2015 for optometrists and ophthalmologists. Since then, the 90 clinics using it have treated more than 6,000 patients. On average, treatment lasts eight months, with patients coming one or two times a week to use the VR system. \"It is a unique, far more efficient solution to treat Amblyopia, as well as a wide array of binocular vision dysfunction,\" said Dan Fortenbacher, founder of Wow Vision Therapy, which has two locations in Michigan. \"The progress the patient makes in breaking through suppression and developing 3D vision has been remarkable with Vivid Vision.\" Wow Vision was one of the first practices to use virtual reality in a clinical setting. Vivid Vision will use this new round of funding to expand and accelerate its vision care platform. Although the treatment is currently only available in clinics under the supervision of a trained eye care professional, the company is releasing its home version of the treatment, Vivid Vision Home, later this year. Vivid Vision Home runs on both desktop and mobile VR platforms and will require a prescription from an eye doctor. \"Vivid Vision Home will make vision therapy accessible to millions of new patients for whom treatment was previously too expensive or inconvenient,\" said Blaha, in a statement. \"We're really fortunate to be partnered with the best optometrists, ophthalmologists, and vision scientists to make this a reality.\" Ubisoft has also been working on a VR game to address lazy eye.

    "title": "Cancer screening firm Guardant Health raises $360 million to sequence tumor DNA of 1 million patients",
    "content": "Guardant Health, a startup that's been pushing to open a new front on the global war on cancer, has raised $360 million in a gargantuan round of funding led by a subsidiary of Japanese telecoms giant SoftBank, with participation from Sequoia Capital, Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, OrbiMed, 8VC, \"certain funds and accounts\" managed by T. Rowe Price, and Temasek, among others. Founded in 2013, Guardant has been developing a non-invasive screening tool that relies on blood samples rather than tissue to detect cancer. The \"Guardant 360\" test is designed to help patients avoid risky and expensive biopsies. The genomic test helps pair patients who have advanced cancer with targeted therapies, as well as with emerging drugs in clinical trials. Guardant had already raised around $190 million, including a chunky $100 million Series D round last January. With its latest cash injection, the company has revealed plans to sequence the tumor DNA of more than one million cancer patients within the next five years. With this data, Guardant said that it expects to fuel \"fundamental advancements across the continuum of cancer care\" while expediting the development of blood-based tests to detect early-stage cancer. \"We believe that conquering cancer is at its core a big data problem, and researchers have been data-starved,\" explained Guardant CEO and cofounder Helmy Eltoukhy. \"Our launch of the world's first commercial comprehensive liquid biopsy sparked a boom in cancer data acquisition. Every physician who orders one of our tests and every patient whose tumor DNA we sequence add to this larger mission by improving our understanding of this complex disease. With this ambitious five-year effort, we intend to accelerate this progress and provide a much-needed infusion of data into the field.\" Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and is responsible for around 1 in 6 deaths. Early detection is known to improve a patient's outcome significantly, as it helps prevent the disease from spreading around the body. This is why Guardant is attracting so much VC investment: It's fighting a disease that has had a tremendously destructive impact on human life. Life sciences in general is drawing major investment from big names across the technology spectrum. Alphabet's investment arm, GV (formerly Google Ventures), has a long history of investments in health tech, and in the past couple of months alone it has invested in SpyBiotech, an Oxford University spinout working on \"next-generation\" vaccines, as well as joining a $29 million investment into Science 37 to help bring clinical trials to the home. Elsewhere, Alphabet has two additional health-focused technology arms. Verily Life Sciences (Verily) recently announced that it had received an $800 million investment from Singapore-based investment firm Temasek, the same organization that just invested in Guardant. Verily's stated goal is to build technology to \"better understand health\" and prevent and manage diseases. And Calico, which was founded in 2013 by Google and Arthur D. Levinson, is a biotech research body with a focus on extending human life. Last year, Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced a $3 billion program to prevent, cure, or manage \"all diseases\" within their children's lifetime. Guardant's goal fits within these other ambitious initiatives to extend human life through curbing one of the world's biggest killers. Alongside the funding news, Guardant and SoftBank also revealed a new joint venture designed to commercialize Guardant's existing liquid biopsy technology across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. \"Our investment will enable Guardant, already the clear leader in an exciting field, to become the Rosetta Stone for cancer, across all stages,\" added Masayoshi Son, SoftBank Group chairman and CEO.

    "title": "Backed by Andy Rubin, Lighthouse raises $17 million for its AI home assistant",
    "content": "A new intelligent assistant makes its debut today to compete with the likes of Alexa, Cortana, and Google Assistant. Lighthouse distinguishes itself from its competitors by using computer vision to detect and monitor activity within a home. Until now, Lighthouse has operated in stealth since 2015. Today, the company also announced the close of a $17 million funding round, led by Eclipse Ventures with participation from Playground Ventures. Lighthouse and its 30 employees are based at Playground Ventures. Android co-creator Andy Rubin created the Playground Global incubator and office space for startups. Its $300 million investment fund closed in 2015. Lighthouse can't play you music or tell you jokes like Alexa or Cortana can. But the device's makers explain that if other assistants are for giving you control of things when you're home, Lighthouse is designed to deliver insights when you're away from home. A simple voice or text search can tell you when your kids get home, whether they've been running in the house, and if the cat or the kid broke a vase while you were at work. Should your teen bring their significant other over without supervision, Lighthouse can see it, alert you, and patch you in to speak with the young couple. The device was made by cofounder Alex Teichman and CTO Hendrik Dahlkamp, two early adopters of 3D sensors and self-driving cars who met at Stanford University. Dahlkamp was an engineer at Google X and a member of the team that won the DARPA Grand Challenge for autonomous vehicles. \"We're pretty well-versed on the technology that makes lighthouse possible, in particular 3D sensing and deep learning,\" Teichman said. The 3D sensor inside the device makes it possible for Lighthouse to identify people, pets, kids, and other living things or objects by employing the same tech used in autonomous cars. Natural language processing and other AI was built in-house and responds to both text and voice. Search with the Lighthouse app with voice or text and you can save alerts for whatever in your house you know Lighthouse can see, whether it's an unidentified intruder or the dog on the couch. People in videos are distinguished by differently colored halos. Each Lighthouse device comes with annual installments of $399 for the first year plan, $499 for the three year, and $599 for five years of Lighthouse computer vision coverage. Those unhappy after a year can choose to ask for a refund for the difference. Customer data is not gathered by Lighthouse unless explicit permission is given to do so. And there's not going to be an ecommerce upsell to add Pinterest or Amazon image search so Lighthouse can get a cut and turn a profit, Teichman told VentureBeat. \"We are not going to try to sell you a better scarf. That's not why we exist,\" he said. \"We are very interested in providing a delightful AI service in return for money and a transaction.\"  Lighthouse is coming on the scene at an especially busy moment for intelligent assistants. Microsoft has announced a series of upgrades to its cognitive service, the Microsoft Bot Framework, and the newly released Cortana Skills Kit. Skype video bots were also introduced. On Monday, Harman Kardon announced that its smart speaker Invoke is due out in the fall with Cortana inside. On Tuesday, Amazon released its Echo Show and the ability to make phone calls and send messages with Alexa-enabled smart speakers and devices. Additional Cortana announcements are forecast to take place today at Build 2017, Microsoft's annual developer conference. Announcements could also be on the way when Google holds its I/O conference next week. The $17 million funding led by Eclipse Ventures included participation from Playground Global, SignalFire, and Start. Other investors include Sebastian Thrun, director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University. Lighthouse has 30 employees. ",

    "title": "On-demand freight delivery platform Ontruck raises $10 million from Atomico, others",
    "content": "Ontruck, a Spanish on-demand platform that connects businesses with road freight companies, has raised $10 million in a series A round of funding led by Atomico (U.K.) and Idinvest (France), with participation from existing investors Point Nine Capital (Germany), La Famiglia (Germany), and Samaipata Ventures (Spain). Founded out of Madrid in 2016, Ontruck's on-demand platform gives any company instant access to a freight delivery network to make shipments how and when they need it. The startup had previously raised around $2.2 million, and its latest cash injection is notable insofar as it taps investor cash from four European markets including the U.K.'s Atomico, which was founded in 2006 by Skype cofounder Niklas Zennstrom, and the French VC firm Idinvest. Today's raise comes just a few months after Atomico closed a whopping $765 million fund, and Ontruck represents the fund's second investment in a Spanish startup. As things stand, middlemen charge commission to match supply with demand, while trucks spend more than 40 percent of their time on the roads empty, after dropping off their loads. The knock-on effect of this includes needless Co2 emissions and general inefficiencies that cost everyone involved money, which is where Ontruck comes into play. \"Ontruck solves this problem by providing best in class technology that fully automates the process of matching a shipment to the right truck, for the best price, in just 19 seconds, and at scale could reduce Co2 emissions dramatically,\" explained Carolina Brochado, partner at Atomico. \"This is the kind of significant business and environmental upside that we strive to find in our investments.\" Ontruck offers instant pricing and precise pick-up slots, while shipments can be tracked in real time. To use a somewhat hackneyed analogy, it's a little like Uber for trucking and logistics. The majority of road freight involves regional, short-haul journeys, which is why many of the existing players operate mainly in a single market. Other players in the field include New York-based Transfix, Mountain View-based Trucker Path, Brazil's Cargox, and a bunch more from around the world including Europe's Convargo (France), Chronotruck (France), and iCanDeliver (Netherlands). So far, Ontruck has followed a similar model in terms of rolling out regionally in its native Spain, but with $10 million more in its coffers, the company plans to expand across Europe. A clue to its growth plans may well lie in the origin of the VC firms that are investing. \"Through technology, we want to make simple, low-cost road freight accessible to every business in Europe, regardless of their size,\" added Inigo Juantegui, Ontruck founder and CEO. While a number of players are using technology to capitalize on the lucrative road freight industry, others are tackling things from another angle. Mountain View-based Peloton recently raised $60 million to improve truck platoon safety and efficiency through automation. And it's also worth noting here that road freight isn't the only industry being \"disrupted\" by technology -- last year, San Francisco-based Haven raised $11 million to grow its ocean freight booking platform.

    "content": "Five months after pivoting away from its 99designs-like service to become a more relationship-based marketplace, Design Inc. announced that it's reluctantly shutting down its self-service platform. The company cited less-than-expected traction and a flawed business model. While the service is no more, Design Inc. said the company is \"not going anywhere just yet\" and will be taking time to \"figure out the answer\" to what's next. \"We are still dedicated to bringing excellent product design and design thinking to the world, but we want to take a moment and reevaluate how we approach our offering,\" the company wrote on its website, explaining the news. Launched in 2016 by Marc Hemeon and Bjoern Zinssmeister, Design Inc. wanted to be the \"operating system for designers,\" a valuable resource for creative professionals looking for jobs and building relationships. Initially, the idea was that companies would list out what they wanted and then designers would create it. The company later pivoted to its current incarnation, in which companies submit a Request for Proposal (RFP) and are matched with designers. In a Medium post, Hemeon said that \"hundreds of companies\" have benefited from the service but that \"not everything has been working as planned.\" He declined to cite specifics about what did and didn't work. At one point, Hemeon told VentureBeat that the company counted brands like Nike, Google, Twitter, GoPro, Adidas, Evernote, Netflix, Uber, and Salesforce as customers. Designers with an account on Design Inc. will receive refunds for outstanding credits over the next week. All data from accounts and profiles will be removed. Design Inc previously raised $2.3 million in venture funding backed by Harrison Metal, David Tisch's BoxGroup, Collaborative Fund, O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, Okapi Venture Capital, and 500 Startups.

    "title": "6 AI startups win $1.5 million in prizes at Nvidia Inception event",
    "content": "Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference is all about highlighting companies using graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate artificial intelligence. To juice the ecosystem, Nvidia and its partners tonight gave away $1.5 million in prizes to the winner of the Nvidia Inception Awards for best AI startups. The winners included hottest emerging startup Athelas, most disruptive startup Deep Instinct, and best social impact startup Genetesis. Each of these companies won a $375,000 prize, while $125,000 went to runners-up Focal Systems, Smartvid.io, and Bay Labs. Nvidia, which had $6.9 billion in revenues last year, counts more than 1,300 AI startups around the world as participants in its Nvidia Inception program. A couple of weeks ago, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang hosted a Shark Tank-style event called Nvidia Inception to find the best AI startups. Huang and a panel of judges listened to pitches from 14 AI startups across three categories. Above: Nvidia cofounders Chris Malachowsky (left) and Jen-Hsun Huang. \"It's because of you that we did all this,\" Huang said during the ceremony. \"We're an emerging company too. We built a platform. That platform is only as helpful, successful, and valuable as what you do with it.\" He noted that Nvidia started in 1993 at the dawn of 3D graphics on the PC and it almost went out of business three times before going on to become the biggest surviving stand-alone graphics chip company. \"It's really courageous what you do,\" he said. \"Being an entrepreneur and a creator, you put your face on that idea. I know exactly how that feels, and hopefully that feeling never leaves you.\" Cofounder Chris Malachowsky said, \"We stood on the shoulders of giants. We incrementally improve what is out there. You guys are doing that on top of us. It's really inspirational, and you will do the same for the next generation.\" The 14 finalists were filtered from the more than 600 contestants who entered the contest. The judges included Nvidia's Huang; Gavin Baker, portfolio manager for Fidelity Investments; Tammy Kiely, global head of semiconductor investment banking at Goldman Sachs; Shu Nyatta, investor for the SoftBank Group; Thomas Laffont, senior managing director for Coatue Management; and Prashant Sharma, global chief technology officer for Microsoft Accelerator. Above: Jeff Herbst, vice president of business development at Nvidia. Jeff Herbst, vice president of business development at Nvidia, said in an interview with VentureBeat that the company decided to create a meaningful award to recognize the amazing work being done by AI startups. The three awards focus on the \"hottest emerging startup,\" the \"most disruptive startup,\" and the startup with the \"most potential for social impact.\" I listened to the companies give their pitches to the judges. At the ceremony today, Kimberly Powell, senior director of business development, said it was a big job to filter so many companies. About 100 startups entered the contest for best social innovation, where healthcare companies rose to the top. The social impact winner, Genetesis, has created a low-cost blood analysis test that uses graphics processing units (GPUs) to discern which chest pain patients are suffering heart attacks and which are not. Other finalists in the social impact category were Lunit, which uses an AI-based tool to diagnose breast cancer and other diseases; Insilico Medicine, which uses AI for bio drug discovery; Sigtuple, which uses disease screening technologies through data-driven intelligence; and runner-up Bay Labs, which uses ultrasound and AI to make better diagnostic imaging possible. Above: Kimberly Powell of Nvidia and Genetesis cofounders. \"This is really crazy because we started out as your classic dorm room startup,\" said Peeyush Shrivastava, CEO of Genetesis, at the ceremony. \"We as a company intend to save lives, improve quality, and improve efficiency in the hospital.\" Chest pain results in 10 million visits to the emergency room each year in the U.S. It's a $6.6 billion a year problem, and the ER has a hard time distinguishing between pain that is cardiac-related and the 75 percent of cases that are not. Genetesis is using deep learning, sensors, and physics to diagnose chest pain properly, said Shrivastava. Normally, you have to be hooked up to an electrocardiogram (EKG) machine. But its results aren't conclusive, so you have to then go through a six-hour test known as troponin. Those results aren't conclusive either, so you may have to do a couple more tests. The whole process takes hours, and physicians often keep patients under observation for many more hours. About 5 percent of patients are sent home with an undiagnosed heart problem, and 2 percent die at home. Meanwhile, there is about $494 million in inappropriate stress testing, Shrivastava said. The company has created a test based on a biomagnetic imaging system that monitors the weak magnetic fields that naturally emanate from the chest. It generates a 3D map of the heart that can tell a doctor whether you are having a heart attack or not. A nurse or technician can evaluate a patient in a non-invasive way in 90 seconds. At the patient's bedside, the doctor can determine if the patient will need a stent. \"We are taking on the global challenge of chest pain triage in the emergency room,\" Shrivastava said. The system uses GPU-accelerated AI to make the diagnosis, and the biomagnetic imaging can also be applied to other tests on brain, liver, and fetal conditions. The system can create thousands of 3D maps per patient with 1-millimeter resolution. Genetesis has a data partnership with the Mayo Clinic. The startup was founded in Cincinnati in September 2013 and has about 15 employees. It has raised $1.9 million from Mark Cuban, CincyTech, Wilson Sonsini, Danmar Capital, and 43North. Above: Eli David, chief technology officer of Deep Instinct. Arjun Dutt, director of Inception, presented the award for the most disruptive AI startup. The nominees were runner-up Smartvid.io, which uses AI and computer vision to mine photos and videos for construction site risks; winner Deep Instinct, which uses AI to predict cyber security threats; Cape Analytics, which uses AI and computer vision to help insurance companies write policies for home owners; Konux, which is using AI to enable safe passage of trains on railroad tracks; and DigitalGenius, which uses AI to help companies with better customer service. The company spent more than a year creating its software to run on Nvidia's GPUs, and that turned out to be the smartest decision it made, said chief technology officer Eli David, during the ceremony. Tel Aviv-based Deep Instinct is applying AI to the task of detecting malware. About 1 million new variants of malware are spread every day. Often, a new family of malware is only about 30 percent different from the code of something that came before. Many antivirus vendors focus on detecting known malware in a library, using reactive technology. But Deep Instinct believes the better solution is deep learning, which can be used to detect unknown malware in real time. It doesn't detect virus signatures, sandboxing of content, or heuristics. Instead, it only looks at the binary raw details of the file in question. And Deep Instinct doesn't require frequent updates, said David. It trains the deep learning neural network on hundreds of millions of files. In short, it focuses on prevention, not reaction. \"We do not wait for the attack execution,\" David said. \"We protect against malware, anything from simple mutations up to nation-state attacks.\" The company built its own deep learning infrastructure from scratch, as it had to develop its own flavor of neural networks. The software runs efficiently on the combination of central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) and Nvidia's CUDA software for running non-graphics software on graphics chips. The GPUs enable the company to do in a day what would take three months for a CPU. Deep Instinct prunes 95 percent of the unnecessary processing threads so that it has a much smaller amount of data to analyze. The results are about 99 percent on detection rates, based on independent tests with its customers. By comparison, the competition gets about 80 percent detection. Deep Instinct has a very low false-positive rate of about 0.1 percent, compared with 2 to 3 percent for a deep-learning rival, David said. And Deep Instinct only has to be updated every few months or so. The company started commercializing its software in 2016, and it expects to generate $10 million in revenue this year. In 2018, it hopes to add a solution for traffic analysis, and it will expand to all other areas of cybersecurity over time. Rivals include companies like Cylance. Deep Instinct has 65 employes and has raised $50 million from Blumberg Capital, UST Global, CNTP, and Cerracap. The toughest problem is that people don't understand what is in Deep Instinct's \"black box,\" and they want to know how it works. But the company can easily demonstrate how it beats rivals at detecting the same problems, David said, and that usually convinces prospective customers. Above: Tanay Tandon, founder of Athelas Jeff Herbst presented the award for the hottest emerging startup. Besides winner Athelas, the nominees included Deep Gram, which uses deep learning AI to recognize spoken words; Datalogue, which uses AI to clean up data before it has to be analyzed; and runner-up Focal Systems, which is using AI to automate checkout at retail and to help identify out-of-stock items. Herbst joked that Athelas' business plan is very similar to that of Theranos, the blood analysis company that crashed and burned in a fraud scandal. \"Try not to be Theranos,\" he said as he handed the award to Tanay Tandon, founder of Athelas. Tandon said that Athelas has made an inexpensive machine that is focused on just one of the most common types of blood tests. Using computer vision and deep learning algorithms, Athelas has created a machine that looks at a drop of blood and identifies how many white blood cells it has, said Tandon. \"Blood is the window into someone's health,\" said Tandon. \"The core of what makes it possible is deep learning.\" The imaging system has a patented flow test strip that can spread the drop out to a single cell layer. After it is scanned, the convolutional neural network goes to work on identifying what is in the sample. It can identify problems in a couple of minutes, and it can then tell you the results of the test much more quickly than current methods. It can detect white blood cell trends, leukemia, infections, inflammation, and other problems. Athelas is going after a $50 billion market. The machine costs about $250 to make, and Athelas sells it for about $500. It can also generate about $5 in revenue per test. That is far less expensive than standard lab tests, which typically cost $30 to $50 each. Moreover, Tandon said, about $100 billion is wasted every year in treating diseases that are diagnosed late. The company did a clinical trial with 350 patients, and it identified undetected leukemia in one patient. It is now doing about 100 tests per week with full accuracy, Tandon said. He hopes to ship about 10,000 machines by the end of the year. The company has six employees, and it has raised $3.5 million from Sequoia Capital and Y Combinator. The product has been clinically validated and is undergoing clearance from the Food and Drug Administration. Athelas (named after a healing plant in The Lord of the Rings) was formed in May 2016. Over time, Athelas could expand the testing to other kinds of liquid analysis, such as urine. The company would like to focus on selling a subscription model with a monthly fee for a certain number of tests. ",

    "title": "Microsoft launches Skype video bots in preview",
    "content": "Bots will soon be able to join video conversations in 1:1 and group Skype calls, Microsoft announced today. Bot builders can use the BotBuilder RealTimeMediaCalling extension on Github, now in preview, to bring Skype bots into video conversations. A software development kit for the creation of interactive Skype video bots will be released at an undetermined date, a Skype spokesperson told VentureBeat. \"This platform provides real-time, voice and video streams of a Skype call which allows developers to build personal, immersive communications experiences with services and brands,\" Skype said in a blog post today. Video bots will be able to do a vast range of things. Beyond brand marketing, video bots could act as your virtual secretary online, or interview a job applicant in a mock interview. AI smarts like sentiment and mood tracking could then be used to grade the readiness of a job applicant. Other changes to Skype available in preview today include the ability to embed web chat -- either human or bot -- right on a website. Doing so will allow a merchant or organization to handle customer service on Skype. The move puts Skype squarely in competition with other live chat services for customer service, from Facebook Messenger to established industry players like LivePerson or startups like Smooch. But bots aren't just coming to the web -- the web is also coming to bots. Skype Add-Ins is also in preview starting today. Add-Ins get a dedicated tab in Skype and operate in a webview, much like the chat extensions that were added to Facebook Messenger three weeks ago. To test new features like Add-Ins, join the waitlist or download the Skype Preview app in the Android app store. Much has happened this week in the AI-bot-chat app sphere for Microsoft. In addition to changes to Skype today, Microsoft Bot Framework channels to publish a bot were extended to Skype for Business, Cortana, and Bing.com search results. The framework is now able to use a Microsoft payments API for transactions. The Cortana Skills Kit is now in public preview, and a selection of 20 some-odd Cortana skills were also made available today. Earlier this week, Harman Kardon Invoke, which will feature Skype and Cortana, was given a launch window of this fall. Other Cortana-enabled devices are also on the way in partnership with HP and Intel, Microsoft announced today. ",

    "title": "Microsoft launches Visual Studio 2017 for Mac out of preview",
    "content": "At Microsoft's Build 2017 developer conference, the biggest Visual Studio news wasn't even for its own platform: Visual Studio 2017 for Mac has hit general availability (download here, requires OS X El Capitan 10.11 or higher). Developers can now use Microsoft's flagship integrated development environment (IDE) across Windows and Mac to build for the cloud, mobile, and the web. \"Developers get a great IDE and a single environment to not only work on end-to-end solutions -- from mobile and web apps to games -- but also to integrate with and deploy to Azure,\" Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of the Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise group, said in a statement. \"Whether you use C#, F#, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, Xamarin or Unity, you'll get a best-in-class development environment, natively designed for the Mac.\" Bringing its IDE to macOS is a big milestone for Microsoft, given that the company once made a point of locking in developers by only offering its tools on Windows. This has changed over time, with a big highlight in April 2015 when Microsoft launched Visual Studio Code, its cross-platform code editor, for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Then, in November 2016, Visual Studio for Mac arrived in preview (the \"2017\" was only tacked on today for branding consistency). Now it's out of preview.  Inheriting from the mobile-centric Xamarin Studio and from Visual Studio for Windows, the IDE is supposed to encourage Mac and iOS developers to use Microsoft's development tools, since they will no longer need a Windows computer or virtual machine to do so. Microsoft plans to eventually sunset Xamarin Studio. Visual Studio for Mac supports native Android, iOS, and Mac development via Xamarin, and server development via .NET Core with Azure integration. The C# language, with the latest C# 7 productivity enhancements, is naturally supported, as is F#, powered by the same F# compiler used in Visual Studio.  Microsoft also had some smaller Visual Studio news to share at Build. The new Visual Studio Snapshot Debugger, for example, gives developers insight into cloud production code behavior at the time of an exception, without writing extensive logging statements or exception handling code. Visual Studio 2017 has been updated to version 15.2, delivering the usual bug fixes along with new functionality, such as the return of Python workload, Data Science workload (includes R, Python, and F#), and added support for Typescript 2.2. Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 preview also arrived with more bug fixes and improvements in accessibility. New functionality includes .NET Core 2.0 preview support, Live Unit Testing for .NET Core projects, more C++ standard conformance, enhancement in continuous delivery for ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core projects targeting an Azure App Services, and improvements in container development tools. Lastly, .NET got a small mention today with the release of .NET Core 2.0 preview and ASP.NET Core 2.0 preview. The former allows developers to use .NET Standard 2.0's expanded set of uniform APIs to write once and run on multiple .NET runtimes (.NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin, and Universal Windows Platform). The latter's new capabilities include Razor Pages, a lightweight syntax for combining server code with HTML, streamlined startup, performance improvements, and web apps that can leverage automatic Azure diagnostics and monitoring.

    "title": "Cockroach Labs raises $27 million and unveils an enterprise version of its open source database for developers",
    "content": "Cockroach Labs, which provides an open source database for developers, announced today the launch of an enterprise offering, as well as funding of $27 million. Redpoint Ventures led the round, with Benchmark Capital, FirstMark Capital, GV, and Index Ventures returning as investors. \"We are offering what is going to become the new standard -- 'multi-active availability',\" wrote Cockroach Labs' founder and CEO, Spencer Kimball, in an email to VentureBeat. \"It means multiple servers have replicas of your data, and there are new protections in place to ensure that in the event of failover, applications built on top of the database will not experience potentially damaging inconsistencies.\" The startup's name is a tribute to a cockroach's resiliency. Kimball argues that while databases offered by private clouds like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services (AWS) may offer similar features, Cockroach Labs' product has the advantage of flexibly spanning different clouds in hybrid deployments and migrating between clouds without downtime. \"This means no vendor lock-in, which is a dangerous problem when you're entrusting all of your data to one vendor,\" he wrote in an email to VentureBeat. CockroachDB Enterprise is available starting today through a paid subscription model for customers with larger data sets. The subscription includes incremental backup/restore and support, and the startup claims to already have notable customers in production, including Baidu. Cockroach Labs will use today's funding to further develop its products, increase customer support, and make additional hires.

    "content": "Mya Systems, formerly known as FirstJob, today announced funding of $11.4 million to further develop its recruiter chatbot, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automate outreach and communication with job candidates. Emergence Capital was the sole investor in this round. \"The existing recruiting landscape is made up of Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), online assessments, job boards, and professional networking sites,\" wrote Mya Systems' founder and CEO, Eyal Grayevsky, in an email to VentureBeat. \"The market is broken, as evidenced by the fact that 75 percent of workers submitting applications don't hear back from employers and 54 percent of employers say it's become more difficult to find qualified candidates.\" Mya Systems launched Mya last year and is on pace to interact with a total of 2 million candidates by the end of this year, according to Grayevsky. \"That translates to over 50 million messages, each representing multiple candidate data points,\" he wrote. Mya uses natural language processing and machine learning technologies to automate the pre-screening process of hiring -- things like sourcing, scheduling, and onboarding. The bot communicates with candidates via different channels, including SMS, email, and Facebook Messenger. The cloud-based technology, which integrates with the customer's existing ATS, career site, and calendar systems, is currently in private beta. According to Grayevsky, the startup works with three of the five largest recruiting agencies, as well as with several Fortune 500 companies. The recruiting sector has seen several applications of AI, such as Teamable, which taps into employees' social networks for better referrals, and Beamery, which uses a hybrid of customer relationship management (CRM), marketing, and AI to treat candidates like customers. Founded in 2012, San Francisco-based Mya Systems has raised a total of $11.4 to date -- the $3 million seed round raised in 2012 converted into this round, wrote Grayevsky. The startup will use the new capital to hire additional machine learning engineers and data scientists, increasing its team to 20 employees by this summer. ",

    "title": "Bitcoin hits all-time high of more than $1,700",
    "content": "(Reuters) -- Digital currency bitcoin hit a record high on Tuesday as demand for crypto-assets soared with the creation of new tokens to raise funding for start-ups using blockchain technology. Blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin, is a financial ledger maintained by a network of computers that can track the movement of any asset without the need for a central regulator Bitcoin hit a record $1,760.40 on the BitStamp platform and was last at $1,747.89, up 6 percent on the day. So far this year, bitcoin has surged nearly 80 percent. Bitcoin's market capitalization on Tuesday soared to $52.5 billion, according to data from coinmarketcap.com. Aside from being an asset that can be traded on exchanges like stocks and bonds, bitcoin has become a mode of payment for some retailers, such as Overstock.com, and a way to transfer funds without the need for a third party. \"We have an influx of new capital in the space and that capital goes back and forth among crypto-assets and bitcoin,\" said Chris Burniske, blockchain products leader at ARK Invest in New York, which manages exchange-traded funds. \"Bitcoin is still the main liquidity provider in the market and people use it to buy other crypto-assets.\" That said, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari has been skeptical about bitcoin's outlook, noting that blockchain has more potential for being adopted in the future than the digital currency itself. \"I think sentiment has shifted in the markets, in the Fed,\" Kashkari said at a technology conference in Minneapolis on Tuesday. Still, a big part of bitcoin's recent surge is the increase in demand for other digital currencies being sold in so-called \"initial coin offerings,\" or ICOs. Under ICOs, blockchain start-ups sell their tokens directly to the public to raise capital without any regulatory oversight. At least 40 start-ups have launched an ICO this year, according Smith + Crown data. \"For the first time in financial history, founders can access capital from both large and small investors armed with nothing more than a slick website,\" said Arthur Hayes, chief executive at crypto-currency derivatives trading platform BitMEX. Analysts say the foundation for bitcoin's gains was set last July in a process called \"halving,\" in which rewards offered to bitcoin miners shrink. That has constrained bitcoin's supply. Bitcoin relies on so-called \"mining\" computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. In return, the first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoins. (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Dan Grebler) ",

    "title": "How to Position Your SaaS Business For a Platform Sell",
    "content": "I've always said that the companies that scale to become large, sustainable and independent franchises are the ones that offer a platform to the market. The constant evolution aspiration for a startup is to go from feature to product to platform -- to create a company where other companies are born and scaled on your technology offerings. A larger vision and the ability to execute on it is truly what separate the good from the great. Things have changed a lot for Dyn over the 15 years since its inception -- and many of the biggest shifts have come since I joined the company almost eight years ago. Since 2008 we've seen a dramatic shift in the way SaaS tools and services are sold, and how growing SaaS companies are positioning themselves in the market. Like many SaaS companies, Dyn started as a small niche player in an important corner of the Internet -- Managed DNS -- and slowly carved out a space honing our product and beating competitors on service, pricing, relationships, and added-value until we grew to be the market leader. Along the way we selectively added complementary products -- traffic management, Internet intelligence and email delivery -- and continued to grow, ensuring our products worked so well in tandem and delivered such value that the only clear path forward was to deliver a platform sale to our customers. Related: <!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->11 Ways to Make Money While You Sleep We're in the midst of a go-to-market and product transformation to reflect this evolution of our business and this move upstream we're making with the platform is the natural one for businesses that want to drive growth and continue innovating as an independent entity. For Dyn, it's no longer about selling feeds and speeds, but all about selling business value to enterprises. We're certainly not alone in our platform-first approach. A recent Accenture Trend Report noted that 81 percent of executives say platform-based business models will be core to their growth strategy within three years. Creating integrated approaches to solving business challenges is not only good for customers, it's a differentiator for your business that can position you far ahead of the competition. Here are some keys to enabling -- and nailing -- the move to the platform. Enable a Vision and the Rest will Follow Shifting your business to a platform approach requires patience and isn't for everyone. But if your company has several complementary products that combine to create huge value for your customers and prospects, integrating the products and developing additional tools that continue to differentiate your business could propel your growth story. In 2015 we started a cross-company pivot away from product selling and towards a platform sell - delivering the value of all of our core DNS, data, analytics and traffic steering products into addressing the Internet Performance Management space, where we see huge potential for the company through the next 5 years and beyond. But before we saw a platform approach, we had to see the vision for how our existing products could deliver on a larger promise for our customers. Related: <!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->5 Habits of the Wealthy That Helped Them Get Rich Having the vision for a platform sale is also necessary for any business to continue to be an independent player, especially in an ecosystem where companies with unique tools or services are targets for companies that already have a platform play. Building out a platform and successfully rolling it out to customers -- and ensuring they embrace it -- is a big challenge, but with big challenges come big opportunities. Build What Customers Want - and Validate It may seem obvious to build products well-tailored to customers' wants and needs but too many SaaS product development teams fall into the trap of iterating based on their own visions for the product rather that keeping to the goal of solving very specific customer problems and solving them well. At Dyn, we've kept our focus on this and it has helped us grow over the long-run, with 29 consecutive quarters of growth and counting. Keeping a keen eye on the customer has meant each of our products and each of our acquisitions has been based on fulfilling a need. As customer needs have been filled we've constantly challenged ourselves and this has led to a natural progression in thinking from feature to product to suite to platform. The platform has always been the goal, but it has become the emphasis based on clear customer need. This \"market-in\" rather than \"product out\" mindset is imperative to understanding what customers truly want and enabling your business to deliver through the out years. It was critical for us to match our own maturation with the macro trends happening across the Internet infrastructure landscape and affecting CIO and CTOs of companies big and small. Timing is everything. Empower Leadership for a Full Throttle Change Building the vision and strategy and green-lighting the move to a platform approach was one of the most significant decisions our leadership has made over the history of the business. Not only did it signal a serious shift in our marketing and sales approach, it required a mammoth undertaking by our product and engineering teams to build the software that would enable our massive business shift. Many times products are utilized by customers with siloed interaction points. This user experience needs to be elegant with clean workflows and interfaces or via robust APIs. Related: <!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Habits of the World's Wealthiest People (Infographic) While it was a true team effort to develop the strategy and action plan for the platform play, it was crucial for the plan to be communicated to leaders across our near 500-person business, to our regional offices in the UK, Australia and Singapore, and understood and internalized by all of our staff. Enabling this change was a huge decision and we've had to turn the company and ensure the message is resonating and being communicated across all departments and through all disciplines. We also based one of our biggest hires to date, our global head of sales, on his ability to grow our sales apparatus to meet this platform approach. If you want to have a big vision for your company's future, you truly have to go all in. Reorg and Resize You can't make a platform play without shaking up your organization significantly. We have shifted focus in many areas of our business and have had to reorganize teams and assets to meet the challenges we've placed on ourselves. This is never an easy proposition for a business, but if leadership articulates the vision, charts the course and firmly plants the flag, showing how your business can meet the opportunity before it, your business will be set to optimize for the exciting opportunities ahead. At Dyn, our platform play has meant that we're now prepared to hunt down opportunities in business categories that are emerging as the big prospects of the future: automation, predictive analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), full cloud adoption, mobile and ever more globalization and global growth. Our internal reorganization has meant shifting focus for many of our best thinkers and the creation of new strategic groups that are helping the whole organization to shift to meet opportunity. We've developed a specific research group, integration group, partnerships and alliances group and a solution architecture team to set us on a footing for success. Change is never easy, especially in already successful organizations, but if you want to be sustainable and impactful you need to see the future and set a foundation to get you there. Employees, long-time customers and other stakeholders might question a shift in focus after so many successful years of business. But moving to a platform play requires opportunism, guts, and vision with a commitment to taking on the challenges of tomorrow.

    "title": "Payments Are Moving Into the Environment Around Us. Is Your Business Following?",
    "content": "It's been a decade since the iPhone launch opened the floodgates for smartphones. By 2012, smart phones accounted for over 50 percent of all US mobile phones and that rate climbed to over 80 percent last year. Businesses have spent much of that decade inventing new ways for customers to engage and ultimately pay via all those phones. Now that the marketplace focus has moved from wallets, purses and cash to digital and mobile payment, the next transition is already in sight: Payments are ready to jump from cards and phones into the environment around us, integrated into jewelry, refrigerators or the sensor-rich doorway of an Amazon Go store. Related: The 15 Most Popular Online Payment Solutions Businesses that lean into the expanding universe of mobile payment will be the first to capture new kinds of market share. Just to stay with smartphone-based examples, look how Uber has come from nowhere to become a cultural and economic force, in part with frictionless payment integrated into the app. And now another mobility business, route-finder Waze, is adding order-ahead functionality for Dunkin' Donuts that will let drivers buy their coffee and donuts faster and more conveniently on their commute. It's an m-commerce win that creates new business for both enterprises. What is the next step? As those examples show, integration is a driving characteristic of the payments industry. Every change until now has made the consumer experience more seamless, more convenient and less time-consuming. Doing so has made the merchant experience more rewarding by putting the relationship rather than the transaction in the forefront, focusing the consumer on the product or service and increasing their engagement. Related: 25 Payment Tools for Small Businesses, Freelancers and Startups What new levels of engagement will be possible when the payment moment is just a matter of waving a ring or taking a selfie for facial recognition? Those are some of the innovations on display at TRANSACT, the annual trade show of the Electronic Transactions Association (ETA) May 10-12. Fintech demos will show where the industry is moving, making it possible with embedded chips and software to pay with sunglasses, your home refrigerator or on the table-top of a Cheesecake Factory. Some of the methods use phone apps, like one that can pay at a vending machine or another that covers subway fares. Others are harnessing the new world of sensors and connected devices to do the work around us, like the Amazon Go grocery store that monitors what you take off the shelf and then charges for it as you walk out the door without going through a check-out line What all these innovations have in common is the evolution from card and POS machine to a new model for payment systems. The model going forward is technology-enabled, software-led distribution that allows integrated payments with more fluidity and less friction. The physical devices will vary, and can even be switched out more easily than older, capital-intensive machines. The software heart will be the common denominator. Related: Looking for a New Payment Company? You're 'Due' for Some Good News. Increasingly, consumers are rewarding integration between their digital and commercial experiences. What I take away every year from TRANSACT is the sheer endless possibilities that businesses have for connecting with those consumers, in ways that promise to disrupt existing markets and open new ones.  The lesson for merchants is a crucial one: Payments are not an afterthought but a key part of the experience they offer. A full 70 percent of US consumer spending is done electronically, meaning that businesses with less friction in that transaction are better equipped to acquire and retain customers. The question growing businesses should be asking is no longer \"How do you want to pay?\" but \"How can we make this easier?\" Jeffrey S.

Let us tell the world your success story.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Started >> It's safe to say at this point that Elon Musk has a fondness for offbeat names. In the case of the Tesla car models, it has gotten him into some trouble. Tesla makes three different vehicles, the Model S, the Model 3 and the Model X -- which put together spell out S3X or SEX. Some Tesla owners didn't quite get the joke, and thought that the Model 3 was an upgrade on the Model S, according to The Wall Street Journal. Related: Watch and Read the Transcript of Elon Musk's 'Boring' TED Talk However, for his more recent venture, underground tunneling initiative The Boring Company, Musk opted to go for a slightly higher brow choice for the name of its first tunneling machine. Naming theme for tunnel boring machines will be poems & plays. Decided against plays & poems. Too obvious. First machine is Godot. Still waiting ... Don't know why, when or where. The name is taken from Waiting for Godot, the classic play by Samuel Beckett in which two characters named Vladimir and Estragon wait for someone named Godot who -- 64-year-old spoiler alert -- never actually shows up.

    "title": "4 Ways Your Website Should Change Over the Next 5 Years",
    "content": "Updating your website involves more than just rearranging words and pictures on the homepage. Changing your website involves implementing new technology behind the scenes, eliminating dot-com domains and using research to optimize pages to capture your audience's attention. Just think about your website two, five, 10 years ago. Chances are, it looked quite a bit different from the version you have today. All businesses need to keep up with modern internet technology if they want to maintain their competitive edge. So it's important to keep an eye on emerging website trends and anticipate how evolving tech will impact the creative direction of your website. Attention spans are shortening and the amount of content living online is growing exponentially, so expect to see data influence the future of your website's looks and operating systems. Not sure what trends you should be paying attention to? Here are some examples. When we think of ecommerce, we typically think of logging on to a website store or using a mobile app to do all of our shopping. But virtual reality could be changing how we shop in the very near future. Imagine putting on a VR headset and instead of browsing a flat website catalogue you could be walking through a virtual store or viewing things around a showroom. EBay actually launched what it calls the world's first virtual reality department store, partnering with an Australian-based retailer to bring shoppers an opportunity to shop from home. Though implementing virtual reality on an ecommerce site might take time and money, it could be the way of the future -- and a new way for businesses to gather information on how their customers shop. Finding the best domain name for your new business can be a major challenge. Luckily, website owners are no longer limited to just one or two options to the right of the dot. Businesses, brands and individuals have hundreds of new choices when selecting their digital identities, from \"dot-clothing\" (.clothing) to \"dot-boutique\" (.boutique) to \"dot-style\" (.style) and \"dot-shopping\" (.shopping).  \"Businesses in all industries can pick a domain name that tells the world exactly who they are and what they do,\" say Paul Stahura, co-founder and CEO of Donuts Inc., an internet domain registry that operates nearly 200 of these extensions, dubbed \"not-com\" domain names. \"New businesses can stand out from the crowd in a way that was never possible before, and tell the world what business they're in. For example: No one would know what Driftaway.com is, but www.Driftaway.coffee tells the world that it is a coffee business. Amici.com does not tell the world anything about your business, but www.Amici.catering tells prospective clients that it is a catering business.\" While many small to mid-size businesses are quickly jumping aboard the \"not-com\" domain train, big enterprises have been trading \"dot-com\" names for more memorable ones. For example, Lady Gaga's non-profit organization uses BornThisWay.foundation and Alphabet, Google's parent company, announced their homepage live at ABC.xyz. Even retail giant Amazon is using domain name endings such as www.Amazon.clothing and www.Amazon.shoes to redirect visitors to the appropriate shopping page on its website, while also enhancing SEO. Technology is becoming smarter every day and it's time for businesses, particularly in ecommerce, to include some type of anticipatory artificial intelligence into their websites. A website is more than just a page with pretty pictures and words. Designed properly, a website can relay information about your site visitors and use data on previous customers to predict their needs in the future. More data translates to increased personalization on various websites, which could lead to a more immersive user experience. Take Amazon for example. The Seattle retailer is working on technology it says is \"anticipatory shipping,\" a method that will deliver packages before customers even click buy. Not only will anticipatory technology cut down on delivery time and inefficient service, it could also improve customer satisfaction and increase loyalty to a particular brand. Using a customer's previous order information and shopping habits, data pulled from the Amazon website, Amazon can predict demand based on a variety of factors and begin to show customers more personalized shopping ads based on their past behaviors. With newer, faster and more powerful smartphones hitting the market, websites are increasingly becoming more mobile. Responsive design is no longer an optional feature for websites -- it's the difference between keeping your customers and repelling them to your competitors. And now websites need to take their capabilities one step further and begin incorporating augmented reality into their web designs. Pokemon Go, the hit mobile game, brought augmented reality right into the mainstream and caught the attention of marketers looking for the next big thing. Augmented reality is not the same thing as virtual reality. In AR, users are offered graphical enhancements to the physical environment they're living in. The eyewear industry incorporates AR into their websites seamlessly. Sites such as Lenscrafters have specific websites that allow customers to virtually try on any eyewear product in the Lenscrafters' stock. If you work in the ecommerce space or sell items that need to be tried on prior to purchase, revamping your website to accommodate AR might be good to look into. Technology is changing rapidly and evolving trends make it difficult for websites to stay static. Companies need a competitive edge and the best way to do so is identifying differentiating factors that help your website stand out. Trends like the \"not-com\" revolution and the growing presence of virtual reality will result in websites that are about more than just media and content.

    "title": "7 Things to Consider Before Launching a Fintech Startup",
    "content": "The impact of technology on the financial industry has been powerful. Traditional financial institutions, such as banks, have discovered that new technologies are indeed disruptive. This epiphany has forced age-old financial institutions to develop their own tech capabilities, and to stay ahead of the game, many have partnered with fintech startups or acquired promising new companies. However, the shorthand, \"fintech,\" has become a buzzword, encouraging budding entrepreneurs to believe that they can simply hitch their ventures on to the bandwagon in order to make a quick buck. As with any endeavor, this isn't the case. New businesses, especially in an emerging industry such as fintech, require careful planning and thought. Here are seven things that you need to consider before launching a fintech startup. Regulations are why financial services can be a tough industry to break into. Laws have been put in place in order to safeguard financial systems from abuse. In addition, the amount of compliance that is required of institutions often involves the need for accountants and lawyers. Related: 12 Top Fintech Companies to Watch However, fintech has ushered in new ways of viewing and handling money and has become a gray area for regulation. This is something that has been drawing the attention of lawmakers, especially in fintech companies' charter applications to be \"special purpose national banks.\" This isn't as straightforward as it seems since some fintech services such as peer-to-peer lending operate using new models. In addition, these regulations may vary per market depending on the state, country or region in which you seek to operate. In Europe, there's the impending implementation of the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). While this directive actually opens up the market for fintech in Europe, know that venturing into fintech will require you to know and fully understand these regulations and comply to whatever the territory demands. While banks have acknowledged the disruption fintech has created, this doesn't mean that they will just accept defeat and step aside for the new guys. It isn't exactly banks as institutions that are under threat as much as it's the way we do banking. Banks still hold the assets, and many of them have the capability and clout to either partner up with fintech companies or buy them out. In fact, this is already happening. Bank of America is investing $1.5 million in fintech efforts in Charlotte, N.C. In Europe, Santander has started a fund to develop fintech startups. As a venture, you have to decide if you'd be determined enough to take on the big guys on or if you'd rather explore greener pastures. Related: 4 Things You Should Know About Cashless Payments Security has come to the forefront of all tech ventures today. Data breaches and cyberattacks are still rampant. With the nature of the information fintech companies handle, they are becoming an optimal target for cybercriminals. Getting attacked and having customer data stolen is a surefire way to lose customer trust quickly. Customer trust is key in the financial industry and it is becoming a rare commodity these days. A survey by the National Association of Retirement Plan Participants in 2016 indicates that only 8 percent had faith in their financial institutions. Many will be skeptical of any new services and most people would be wary of the risk sending out financial information or handing over their money to fledgling fintech services. The challenge lies in putting safeguards in place and convincing prospects that your system is robust and secure enough. This might seem obvious, but fintech isn't exactly an area where there are turnkey tools and free scripts one can use to come up with an app or service. This isn't like some other tech ventures where barriers to entry are relatively low. Financial, technological and business expertise are all required to develop fintech. Then, there are compliance requirements that may require you to bring in legal help. Building a strong team means that you must attract talent in various areas of competence, as it truly is a multidisciplinary effort. Fintech is still in a state of flux, at least in the foreseeable future, so the ability to deliver or change direction quickly is essential. Related: How Fintech and Payments Innovations Will Disrupt Global Ecommerce The fintech industry is starting to get crowded now that many pioneers have done enough for new ventures to follow. Still, a key entrepreneurial question to ask is if your venture will be able to offer something unique and high value. All segments related to money are fair game for fintech. We can now see fintech startups enter personal finance, budgeting, payments, lending, investments and insurance. All are trying to find solutions to consumers' problems and offer new ways to do things. The danger for startups is to be a \"me-too.\" Copying can be a bad strategy, especially if there are already similar services that are established in the niche. That said, there are verticals worth considering. Many of fintech's early adopters are millennials who want to integrate their financial matters with their mobile lifestyles. Stock trading app Robinhood's users have an average age of 26. This may mean that other age groups are untapped markets for now, even if communicating a novel value proposition to older and more traditional age groups may come as a challenge. There are also a number of new technologies that are hyped in fintech. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are now figuring in the area of investments in the form of robo-advisors. This data and algorithm driven approach to investing is even challenging age-old financial wisdom. Banks are also experimenting with using chatbots that would allow customers to check account information within Facebook Messenger. Other hot ticket technologies in fintech include blockchain and distributed ledgers. Blockchain, the technology powering the digital currency Bitcoin, is a decentralized way of exchanging value online. It is arguably the biggest threat to banking. As a startup, you may have to bet on technologies that would power the service. On the plus side, technologies such as machine learning and analytics engines are now being offered as a service by cloud platform providers like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, which lowers the barrier for development. However, these technologies have yet to fully mature. You should be prepared for growing pains and hiccups when using them. Related: Regulation is Strangling Fintech Startups: 4 Ways VCs Can Help Forming a tech startup isn't cheap. If your venture isn't a partnership between experts who can develop the entire product and business development, then be prepared to shell out a good sum for talent. As traditional institutions try to assimilate fintech talent for themselves, startups would surely face competition in the hiring. There are also the typical capitalization and operating expenses associated with starting a business. What further increases the expense for fintech startups are integrations with traditional institutions such as banks and brokerages. Still, many are optimistic since funding for fintech is at a high. Global venture capital investment was $17.4 billion in 2016. However, this excitement only means that competition for funding is also increasing. VCs are getting more selective, seeking out companies with truly game changing offerings, thus making your value proposition all the more important. Fintech isn't for everybody. It demands expertise, creativity and frankly a lot of grit to launch a startup in a volatile and competitive industry. There are arguments highlighting the supposed disconnect between the slow-changing realm of finance and the fast-changing world of technology. The pressure for tech companies to deliver huge results rapidly can also be immense. Still, if you believe that you will be able to solve financial issues for your users through innovative means, go ahead. Fortune favors the bold. Just be smart with how you do it.

    "title": "How This Entrepreneur Made A Chatbot Platform Successful",
    "content": "Are you taking advantage of chatbot in your marketing strategy? Within the last year, 30,000 developers started building chatbots and almost every major tech company, including Facebook, Microsoft and Google announced support for chatbots. For those new to the term, a chatbot is a service, powered by rules and sometimes artificial intelligence, that you interact with via a chat interface. Justin Clegg, co-founder and CEO of Rescue.io, saw how quickly consumer-driven messaging startups were scaling and wanted to be part of the action. Clegg began his technology career at Intel Corporation leading consumer product and content marketing initiatives for a variety of product device categories. During his journey, Clegg has discovered a roller coaster on which he learned about himself and different consumer behaviors in messaging. Clegg felt it was important to create something of value within his community. In order for Clegg to build a chatbot platform, and create a successful business around it, he needed to focus on three key areas. Related: Top 10 Best Chatbot Platform Tools to Build Chatbots for Your Business In order for your business to be able to withstand the heavy competition in your niche, you have to ask the why questions. Why am I building this? What specific problem am I trying to solve? Why will this be the greatest chatbot service for this particular niche? These are important when setting up your chatbot strategy because it allows you to solve specific problems within your niche. Why questions make your chatbot more productive and targeted. It can also lead to the death of a horrible chatbot in which you were saved from production. Trying to kill your chatbot is the best way to create a great chatbot. Get your hands dirty with your why questions and really delve into the why -- it can teach you a lot about both your target market and your chatbot. Another great question you should be thinking about is this one... Where are you creating lasting value within your service? As with any chatbot program, the more values you collect the more lasting your product will become within your market. It's very important to understand the why questions because it will keep you grounded and on the right track within your market. Related: 10 Tips for Creating a Great Chatbot Everyone has personal pain points. Entrepreneurship stems from clearly identifying those pain points and being able to solve them. The challenge is to identify a market, or how many people are also experiencing your pain point. If the market is big enough and enough people would be interested, then you build a product. Clegg mentions when you are thinking about your target market, you should remember your 'Why' and use this to identify your market to become more relevant to their wants and needs for the future of your bots success. Once you have identified your marketplace it's time to set up a strategy which will attract them to your business. You can choose to have your interface connected to meaningful human experiences, include loyalty programs, create the right mix of bot-to-human conversation within your business, and more great ideas like these. When you identify your market you have found a permanent home for your product. Don't skimp on this step because it will determine whether or not your chatbot will succeed or fail. Simply put, identify and then attack with a marketing plan which is personal, relevant and effective. Related: 7 Ways Chatbots Can Benefit Your Marketing Strategy 3. Unify your team with communication. As with any business, it will either succeed or fail because of the people within the confines of that company. Clegg says one of the superpowers a startup business can ever have between its employees is the power of communication. Never underestimate the true impact of clear communication. Communication is not only making sure you're on the same page as everyone else, or vise versa, but it's also direct and honest feedback between team members. Related: Top 7 Chatbot Monetization Strategies You Need to Know It's important to have open lines of communication to stay aligned. It may require a phone call at 2 a.m. with a simple idea or product feature request. Anyone who has worked with Clegg can relate to countless experiences of him tripping out of the shower to pick up the phone with an idea around a product. With that, it's also critical to challenge each other's ideas and opinions to make sure you have exhausted every avenue in order to determine the correct approach to product development, marketing strategy, and a lot of other choices made within the business. Having a unified team means having great communication at all times. It means you should always have an open mind to the new guy's point of view just as much as you would someone else who has been there for years. Allow them the freedom of clear communication and watch your team's unity soar. Today, Justin is building Square One Labs, a next generation messaging platform to help consumers become more productive via mobile messaging. Clegg's vision for the future includes a variety of personal assistance services, task automation, connecting people to products and services and even bridging the digital divide by texting the homeless community. As it turns out, nearly 70% of the homeless community owns at least a feature phone and messaging could be a step towards connecting the tech elite to the homeless community in San Francisco.

    "title": "Startup Step-By-Step: Down",
    "content": "A year ago, after closing my first startup, I attended one of those conferences that you're supposed to attend. There were a lot of old friends there, folks who I hadn't seen in a while, and there was the usual collection of panels and panelists, Power Points and Pellegrino. As I stood in a sun-full room clutching a coffee someone asked me about my first startup. The reaction was swift. First I felt the old gut churning, the fear. It was like bringing up the name of a family member who had recently died, like raising old ghosts. I started to talk - \"We just were too early, it was a good experience\" - but then it got harder and harder. A failure is a blow. It's a pop to the nose, tears welling up not out of sadness but out of surprise and anger and disappointment. Disappointment in yourself, in your choices, in your inability to stick to it. A feeling that you should have done better. A feeling that you rarely get as an adult in a cubicle, sitting and waiting for the next paycheck. It's a feeling that I knew I needed to feel but it was also a feeling that hurt to the core. This isn't a post about crying at a tech conference. That happened and it was at once embarrassing and enlightening. It's a post about one or two things you'll feel when you build and how to cope. The brogrammer will say that you're not ready to be an entrepreneur if you can't handle this shit. He's wrong and he'll get his soon enough. This is a human activity more akin to art than science. Any art that doesn't make you feel something is a waste of your time. So when you embark on this remember that what you're feeling is perfectly normal and perfectly dreadful. First, listen to your body. When we were raising funds in New York and the Valley I'd wake up in a panic. I'd wake up not wanting to work. For the first time in my career I didn't want to go to my computer and get started. I was gaining weight. My guts were broken. The fear was palpable. I tried to fix things through work but, and this is something I took with me to my new startup, Jaywalk, I found that what I needed was to walk or run. I needed to get out. Some kind of movement tended to calm me gave me a moment to solve my problems. One particularly rough day I walked 80 blocks through my neighborhood, from down near Green-Wood Cemetery to Downtown Brooklyn. It felt good to be out. I started running four times a week recently and I feel much better. I learned from my friend Rich that walking releases endorphins and helps the body heal itself. Further, when you feel this way, when you wake up in a sweat day after day, there are few things to check. First, tell your partners or programmers what you'd like to change. There is always something - in our case we'd have long meandering talks about stuff that didn't exist yet, a problem that is symptomatic of having a bad tech stack. In retrospect I couldn't have changed much about that experience but you'll find that you often feel better when your tech is going right. Find the thing you need to change. A startup is an engine for experimentation. Experiment in order to hone in on the true problem. Raising is also a stressor. Again, the old Brosephian adage, \"Suck it up, you big baby\" doesn't apply here. I've heard from hundreds of founders, candidly, that they hated raising. The rejection, the waiting, the curt emails back - all of these are arrows to the back. Eventually you fall. If you can bootstrap, do it. VC is in a strange place right now and the old days of team and a dream are over. Until new models firm up I'd honestly explore equity crowdfunding and crypto-based raises. I'll write more on that later. I also recommend something that I've been trying, a form of behavioral therapy. I ask myself why I feel this way, what immediately preceded the feeling, and then work out a solution. It's drastically simplified but it helps. Startups are full of stress. The stress of managing people, of quitting your full-time job, of handling the ups and downs of startup life all lead to a dangerous mix. That mix is where I really wanted to go today. Startups are dangerous in that they bring you the brink again and again. They can destroy you. I've seen too many young, promising entrepreneurs end their lives because of some perceived failure. May is Mental Health Awareness Month. Brad Feld and his friend Chris Heivly have already written about this. Please read what they have to say. Their stories are far deeper than mine. In short, given the right ingredients, startups can bring you to the point of depression or and exacerbate mental illness. If you or someone you love are facing this then please, please get help. I've offered a few coping mechanisms here but I have never been visited by evil thoughts. I've been visited by sadness and fear and disappointment and disillusionment and I've tried to fix them as best I could. I often failed but I got back up. I want all of us to get out of this alive. If you need help please consider visiting The Stability Network or FIRE Within. Visit The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Chat or call 1-800-273-8255. Talk someone you trust. If you'd like to chat I'm johnnybnyc on Skype and my Facebook Messages is open. There will be a day when you cry for lost opportunities. There will be a day when you miss what could have been. And there will be a day, not long from now, when it all makes sense and you can finally smile.  Image via Unsplash/Christian Puta ",

    "title": "Seattle Children's Hospital to test new VR medical technology that could change the lives of patients",
    "content": "Ryan James (left) and Mark Laughery (right) sit in their office space at the UW CoMotion Labs. The two started Pear Med last winter as part of their UW Software Entrepreneurship class and recently entered into negotiations with Seattle Children's Hospital to develop their virtual reality software for clinical use. (Photo by Timothy Kenney)\n A medical diagnosis can be one of the most terrifying and confusing days of a patient's life. Doctors often struggle to fully explain a person's illness to them because internal structures, like a tumor, can be hard to visualize. Soon, doctors could have a new tool that helps remove some of the confusion from a diagnosis: virtual and augmented reality. University of Washington startup Pear Med is taking advantage of that tech with VR and AR software that compiles medical scans into an interactive 3D model. The startup is currently negotiating a partnership with Seattle Children's Hospital to further develop their technology, which could revolutionize the way doctors communicate with their patients and help surgeons prepare for complex procedures.  One of our biggest challenges is being able to separate ourselves from that hype and show this can actually provide long-term value to doctors and patients. Co-founders Ryan James and Mark Laughery started Pear Med during their UW software entrepreneurship class in winter of 2016 and have since moved the startup to CoMotion Labs, the university's virtual reality and augmented reality incubator.  The two combined James' health informatics background with Laughery's design experience to make medical data easier to visualize for patients, doctors and medical students. \"We're still trying to find our niche, so that's one of the reasons we're so excited about this Seattle Children's partnership because they really want to help us understand exactly how this can be used in a hospital,\" James said. Pear Med's software, called Bosc, stitches together 2D images from a patient's MRI or CT scan to create a virtual 3D model unique to their anatomy. Using the AR HoloLens or VR Oculus Rift, users can see a color-coded representation of a patient's bones, organs, and nerves. The software is especially useful to help clinicians visualize the shape and structure of a growth or tumor. Although various medical institutions have expressed interest in Bosc, implementing this technology into a doctor's daily clinical workflow will be no small undertaking. VR and AR headsets are still in their early stages of development and are prohibitively expensive for some institutions to use on a large scale.   \"I think there's a lot of hype around VR and AR, so I think one of our biggest challenges is being able to separate ourselves from that hype and show this can actually provide long-term value to doctors and patients,\" Laughery said. The UW Center for Multidimensional Medicine (CMM) has provided them with the clinical connections to rise to that challenge. The UC Irvine Department of Urology was the first institution to partner with Pear Med to see how the VR software could improve surgical training and planning for procedures such as kidney stone removal. In November of last year, the CMM connected Pear Med with a very unusual case at British Columbia Children's Hospital. In a 1-year-old patient born with only one kidney, radiologists discovered a non-cancerous growth called a lipoma surrounding the base of her spinal cord. Administrators at the CMM and NIH thought the Bosc technology might help the parents understand their daughter's illness and aid her surgeon in planning for a partial removal. The growth was intricately intertwined around her nerves, making it difficult to operate on without causing further neurological damage. James and Laughery drove to BC Children's last November to show the family and their surgical team a virtual model of the child's lipoma. Interacting with a 3D model of the growth helped her parents understand the problem much better than flat MRI images, James said. James said the child's father described himself as \"a pit bull dad,\" who would \"do whatever he has to do to understand the problem and help in any way he can.\"  We open sourced the Pear Interaction Engine on GitHub as our kind of thank you to everyone in the software community.Over the past year, much of Pear Med's funding has come directly from James' and Laughery's own pockets, so the Seattle Children's partnership will be an important source of new capital. In the past, they have received grants and awards for their work, such as $2,500 for an innovation award from the UW Business Plan Competition and $10,000 in hardware donated by UW Medicine.  Since James is still a Ph.D. student and therefore technically a UW employee, UW partially owns the intellectual property of all Bosc code. Any licensing agreement with Seattle Children's will involve royalty payments to both Pear Med and UW. Once James finishes his doctorate, Pear Med will have exclusive ownership over the intellectual property of any new code they write for the software. James and Laughery relied heavily on open source software, such as NodeJS, to develop Bosc, so they felt compelled to share what they'd learned over the last year for free on a popular code sharing website called GitHub.  \"We open sourced the Pear Interaction Engine on GitHub as our kind of thank you to everyone in the software community,\" James said. \"We've learned a lot from the physicians that we've worked with about how they interact in VR and AR, the bad ways to do it and the ways that really help them.\" It could take years before Pear Med is able to fully integrate their technology into a hospital's daily workflow, but James and Laughery believe Seattle Children's will be the perfect environment to test their products.

    "title": "Former Bitly CMO returns to Seattle, creates VC fund to provide NW startups with more early-stage cash",
    "content": "Seattle has become one of the most important top tech hubs in the world, with an all-star lineup of homegrown companies and massive offices for out-of-towners looking to get their hands on the region's deep roster of tech talent. But the city that spawned Microsoft, Amazon, Expedia, F5 and Zillow still comes up short in funding sources for early stage companies, with a lack of options for local startups to get off the ground. Andrew Dumont and Cameron Borumand want to change that. In February they began raising money for a new venture capital fund focused on early stage investments called Curious Capital. The fund is based in Seattle, but it wants to invest in startups throughout the Pacific Northwest. Curious Capital has already cut a couple small checks, and the fund is actively investing. They declined to say what companies they've invested in, and did not disclose the target size of the new fund. But the arrival of a new funding source in Seattle is good news for those who've argued that the Northwest -- despite its amazing array of technologists and world-class companies -- still falls short when it comes to bankrolling the next-generation of companies. The Curious Capital co-founders both hail from Washington state, and recently returned to Seattle from stints in New York and San Francisco. Dumont's mother fell ill, and that brought him back to Seattle earlier this year, though he had always intended to return some day. Borumand is a born and raised Pacific Northwesterner, who comes from a Microsoft and Boeing family. He felt the pull of home and wanted to get involved in Seattle's booming tech scene. The Seattle region has long been critiqued for its general lack of investors, both early-stage angel investors and later-stage venture capitalists. Dumont and Borumand have experienced what they say are stronger funding networks in New York and San Francisco with more options to choose from. And while there are many angel investors who got rich at places like Microsoft or Amazon and now invest as a hobby, Dumont said that the Pacific Northwest needs more options for early stage startups. \"For an ecosystem to be healthy from a fundraising standpoint, you need more active funds, more active investors supporting it,\" says Dumont, adding that they plan to invest across a wide array of sectors, from consumer-oriented companies to business-to-business software. The partners likely will stay away from up-and-coming biotech startups. Dumont has founded and worked for startups in Seattle, including Moz, where he was business development director. He eventually made his way to New York City, where he worked as an entrepreneur in residence at Betaworks, a startup studio similar in concept to Seattle's Pioneer Square Labs. Dumont went on to become chief marketing officer at Bitly, a Betaworks spinoff company. Borumand brings the financial expertise. He is a former investment banker for Vaquero Capital in San Francisco, where he worked on later-stage financing for companies. One thing you won't see in these descriptions, a long track record of raising funds. \"We are kind of bootstrapping a venture fund, which is completely illogical; it's pretty stupid in a lot of ways,\" Dumont said. \"But we really believe in what we are doing, so that's why we are doing this.\" That means raising capital is among the biggest challenges. To overcome this, Dumont and Borumand are starting small, and pitching their expertise as a benefit. They aren't taking a salary, nor have they attached any fees to the fund. In addition to funding, Curious Capital wants to be hands on with companies it invests in, helping them with growth plans and strategies to bring their products to market. Curious Capital isn't the only company to come forward to fill the investor void in Seattle. Last month, GeekWire reported on a new fund called Flying Fish Venture Partners. Founded by Seattle angel investors Heather Redman, Geoff Harris, and Frank Chang, Flying Fish is focused on helping early-stage startups in the Pacific Northwest get through their Series A round of funding and scale to the next level. Dumont said he knows his firm won't entirely fix funding issues in Seattle, but it's a start. Curious Capital also wants to be a cheerleader for the region, promoting work done by local startups. Dumont said Pacific Northwest entrepreneurs are much less likely to brag about their work than counterparts in New York or San Francisco. \"I think one of the challenges here -- one of the gifts and curses of Seattle people, including myself -- is that we put on our headphones and we work, but we don't boast much. We don't talk much about what we are doing,\" Dumont said. \"We are able to build awesome companies here because we are so focused on what we are working on. But it actually hurts because a lot of people don't know there are a bunch of people building early stage companies here.\" ",

UZoom is a Seattle startup that connects viewers in remote locations with streamers on the ground so that they can see interesting events and locations for a small fee. Viewers used uZoom to tune into last year's summer Olympics and house hunters often use it to check out a neighborhood they might be interested in. In March, uZoom raised $1.5 million from Broadmark Capital and angel investors -- funds that probably came in handy during the Creator Republic acquisition. Creator Republic was once known as King of The Web -- a social game that let people vote for Internet celebrities online. At launch in 2011, it was backed by Zillow and Expedia co-founder Rich Barton and venture capitalist Nick Hanauer. The startup eventually pivoted to become a video sharing platform. \"Creator Republic has a passionate group of video creators that are looking to monetize their content,\" said uZoom CEO John Kueber. \"UZoom's platform of allowing viewers to pay for live video content provides that platform. Since our launch at the Rio Olympics in August of 2016 we have paid out thousands of dollars to video creators and we believe the Creator Republic users will accelerate that trend.\" Creator Republic CEO Gary Schmidt will join uZoom as a consultant.

(Versive Photo)\n Context Relevant -- a well-funded Seattle-area startup founded in 2012-- has been flying under the radar for the past few years after its founder and CEO stepped down. Now it's stepping back into the limelight with a new product and a new name. The company announced Thursday that it is changing its name to Versive and also unveiled the Versive Security Engine, an artificial intelligence-powered cybersecurity system designed to protect companies' enterprise systems from hostile attacks. The tool works by connecting instances of suspicious or malicious activity detected at different points in the network and across time, which Versive says sets it apart from other available cybersecurity services. \"Malicious actors already operating inside networks are fast becoming the top machine-scale problem in business and government today,\" Versive CEO Joe Polverari said in a statement. \"As one of the foremost innovators in artificial intelligence, our team recognizes the unrivaled power of data science, machine learning, and automation to solve these high-stakes cybersecurity challenges.\" \"Today's launch is the result of extensive development efforts between our platform team, customers, and top minds in the fields of cyber defense and national security. Any organization can now leverage the power of advanced machine learning to gain an advantage over cyber threats by using the Versive Security Engine, built on true AI innovation and tailored to meet progressive security teams' demands,\" he said. Versive was originally founded as a data science and analytics company focused on the financial market. Its new focus -- and new look -- come two years after the company cut a third of its staff and conducted a deep operational review following the departure of its founder and CEO, Stephen Purpura. Polverari was appointed CEO last spring following an interim period when the company was led by investor and board member Chris Kelley. ",

Feinzaig and I caught up after the SFFA Startup Showcase, featuring eight entrepreneurs who joined the group in search of community and support from other female founders. In celebration of SFFA's launch, a crowd of tech workers, investors, and entrepreneurs filled The Riveter, a brand-new co-working space for women that just won GeekWire's Newcomer of the Year Award. Feinzaig called the event \"an out-of-body experience.\" Feinzaig started SFFA as a private Facebook group for her female founder friends. She had been building Venture Kits, a box subscription company that teaches children entrepreneurial skills through play, and she found the startup journey a bit isolating and lonely. She encouraged members of the group to support one another in big ways and small while they tried to get their startups off the ground. Fast-forward eight weeks and the group has 75 members (with another 40 applications pending) and Feinzaig is fielding inquiries from founders in other cities about how they can set up local chapters. \"Our mission is to help each other succeed,\" she said on stage before the pitch-off. \"Individually, we are drops of water.

    "title": "Gold Coast music streaming startup Guvera ceases operations",
    "content": "Almost a year after the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) blocked its attempts to list, prompting discussions around startup IPOs, music streaming startup Guvera Limited has ceased operations, with founder and chief executive Claes Loberg departing.  Fairfax reported that shareholders were informed on Friday evening of the departure of Loberg and major investor Steve Porch from the board, with remaining cofounder and director Darren Herft calling on those interested in joining the board to step forward.  Founded in 2008 with ambitions to take on Pandora and Spotify, the Gold Coast startup's streaming platform operated on a brand-funded model, and was looking to focus its efforts on emerging markets including India and Indonesia after finding little success locally.  Having raised $185 million in funding from over 3,000 investors, many self-managed super funds, since launch, the Guvera last year issued a prospectus stating it would be aiming to raise between $40 million and $100 through a float that would put its valuation at over $1 billion. This valuation confused many; despite having 14 million users across 10 countries, the prospectus showed the startup had brought in just $1.2 million in revenue through the 2015 financial year, and lost $81 million. With the company haemorrhaging money, the float would be key to the company's survival. The prospectus noted: \"Should Guvera be unable to raise sufficient capital under the prospectus, there is a significant uncertainty whether Guvera will be able to continue as a going concern and therefore, whether it will be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due.\"  Concern over the proposed listing grew in both the startup and wider community, with the Australian Shareholders' Association director Geoffrey Bowd saying Guvera was a good example of how important is is for shareholders to carefully read offer documents in order to fully understand the risks associated with a business. \"It is really concerning that a loss-making company which expects operating losses and negative operating cash flow to continue into the future may list on the ASX, particularly where its ongoing viability is dependent on the proceeds from the IPO,\" he said.  With concerns mounting, the ASX blocked the listing, releasing a statement it had \"exercised its discretion to refuse admission, based on material contained in Guvera's application for admission\".  Following the failed float attempt, Guvera Limited put subsidiaries Guvera Australia and Guv Services into administration, while Guvera Employment also called in administrators in late March.  Loeberg reported in a note to shareholders in March that the company would be refocusing its efforts on a new business model, advertising tracking, powered through an app called DragonFli.  \"Rather than us maintaining the expense we once had providing a full music streaming platform, we are outsourcing this to third party providers. All content will now be delivered only inside brand channels, and only at the request and expense of the brands using the content in separate deals with content owners,\" Loeberg wrote.  According to the AFR, the company hoped this app would help it bring in the money necessary to help it meet the terms of a deed of company arrangement, with Guvera needing to pay the creditors of its subsidiaries $180,000 each month. To recoup funds for investors, Herft stated the company holds \"valuable IP\" which could be sold off or commercialised, and claimed the company was also owed $6 million in R&D tax credits. ",

    "title": "Avaza is tackling the project management market through integrated features for SMBs",
    "content": "In the midst of a chaotic week filled with overdue invoices and overflowing calendar invites, staying organised is not easy. Helping businesses navigate the chaos are a shelf of project management tools, a space mostly dominated by industry heavyweights like Asana and Trello. Another startup looking to enter the space is Avaza, a platform which looks to offer a cheaper, feature-packed alternative focused on helping medium businesses (SMBs) complete service-based work. As described by Avaza's founder, Tim Kremer, the platform looks to be an \"all-in-one solution\" helping SMBs run their more efficiently. In particular, the platform offers tools for time tracking, expense reporting, quoting, invoicing and project management in one integrated product. Founded in 2014, the integration-focused philosophy worked strongly for the startup, as it steadily grew without external funding from one user to serving roughly 15,000 across 150 countries, growth which Kremer credited to mindful budgeting and cost-free marketing methods. \"We've bootstrapped since inception. We believe if you can go as long as you can without seeking funding you'll get a much better return on investment at whatever stage you do decide to sell equity. It's something that's also given us creative control over the business and helped take it in the direction we wanted,\" he said. Kremer, who previously worked in the software consulting industry for 10 years, had first imagined Avaza following issues he was experiencing regarding collaboration and time-tracking while completing service work. \"Often we found that collaborating on the projects and tracking our time then getting paid for that work was onerous, in that you'd have lots of different systems being used all at once. There was [also] no way for your clients and yourself to see how productive the projects were and whether they were on track,\" he said. Banding together with cofounder Behram Khan, former Head of Software at Channel 7, the pair identified that these issues pertained to service-based work across all industries, opening the possibility to develop a profitable and relevant digital solution. Growing the startup at first was a \"slow and steady\" process according to Kremer, who said that Avaza faced the arduous challenge of going up against the aforementioned project management giants like Trello and Asana. Acknowledging the similarities between the existing solutions and Avaza, Kremer differentiated the platform at the point of it \"going deep\" into solving a business's problem. \"They're generalist tools,\" he said. \"For example they'll stop at basic task tracking, and don't integrate a lot of the features that service businesses need, and that's a massive portion of the economy. [For example] they don't offer time tracking and invoicing features that these companies require.\" Discussing the solutions in the market that do offer these features, Kremer said they're typically \"large products available only to really large companies\", costing a significant amount and requiring a steep learning curve. Avaza, he said, wants to be the more affordable and accessible option. \"We've tried to re-invent that technology for SMBs with a design that's really easy to pick up and use. They start with utilisation reports, billable and unbillable time, profitability reports and whether a customer project was financially worth it or not. They're the sort of tools that help you grow your business.\" Sticking to a bootstrapped budget, the startup grew its customer base through listing on a number of \"free marketplaces\", a move which the founder accounted to helping Avaza gain relevant exposure for no cost. \"I think this comes back to bootstrapping, you want to get as many customers as possible without spending money,\" he said. \"And if you can encourage your customers to leave a few comments or ratings, you can elevate yourself in those stores for free and generate traffic that way.\" When first accessing the Avaza platform, businesses are able to access a quick 'getting started' tutorial to guide them through the essential functions, such as completing timesheets. Each component, including time tracking, invoicing and project management, is then split into separate spaces, like tabs, to avoid clutter. Similar to other project management tools in the market, the platform is able to integrate with a number of plugins, currently accessible to over 700 in the market such as accounting softwares syncs and calendar tools. Listing Avaza on global marketplaces meant the startup began accumulating global clients, something which Kremer said the business anticipated from the get-go by including international accessibility during development. This means Avaza supports multiple currencies and various freight exchange rates, as well as different language and number formatting. Having kept mostly in \"stealth mode\" so far, Kremer said the startup is now looking to get its name out there to facilitate growth, after deciding that the product had evolved to a strong point. The startup is now aiming to grow its local and international customer base through marketing and PR efforts while continuing to build outs its product. ",

    "title": "Melbourne fashion ecommerce tool To Me Love Me wants to help shoppers find the right fit",
    "content": "Australians love shopping online, with data from NAB last year finding ecommerce sales had grown to over $20 billion in the year to the end of June 2016.  While a growing portion of these sales come from fashion platforms, the experience of buying clothes online isn't a perfect one. Sizing is a particularly big issue; if your body doesn't look like that of the model pictured, it's hard to know whether an item will look good on you, despite it being available in your size. With this in mind, many retailers offer free returns, with customers in turn buying a variety of items to essentially try them on, knowing they will return them.  However this is inefficient and costly.  Nick Robertson, founder and then-CEO of online fashion retailer ASOS, which offers free returns, told Reuters in 2013 that just a one percent fall in returns would immediately add 10 million pounds to the company's bottom line. At the time, the company's return rate sat at an average of 30 percent taking into account variations between different markets.  As Reuters pointed out, the cost goes beyond just offering free shipping, however: there is also the cost of potentially damaged goods, and the cost of trying to sell items that might not be season-specific by the time they're returned, a particularly significant issue in the fast-fashion environment. Then, of course, there's the cost of the disappointed customer that might not return.  Founded by Nicola Byrne, Nicolas Lapomarda, and Penny Whitelaw, Melbourne startup To Me Love Me aims to solve the problem and make the whole process more efficient through a sizing tool. Integrated into an online retailer's website, the tool will help shoppers find the right fit on their first go, almost giving shoppers a 'made to measure' experience.  The idea came to Whitelaw in the same way she said she images many startup ideas do - through a conversation she had with her girlfriends around fashion and their \"ongoing issues\" with online shopping.  \"The problem was not finding apparel online; the main point of contention was finding fashionable clothing that fitted and flattered, which reflected our personalities and complemented our lifestyles,\" she said.  \"Like all brands, each of us is unique, our bodies being no exception. Although sizes should allegedly fit, what we found was, our purchases were arriving too large or too small and the online experience was at best, generic.\" Researching the issue and seeing the impact returns have on retailers too, Whitelaw decided there was a viable business to be made out of solving the problem.  After bringing the team together, Whitelaw said over 12 months were spent on research and development, with focus groups and one on one meetings held with retailers, influencers, and online shoppers to better understand their various problems and validate the need for a solution, and in turn determine how to build it. \"Across all conversations there were a few recurring points raised. Customers want more from their online shopping experiences; they want surety of fit and they want to be presented with relevant apparel, recognising that they are all originals...the one size fits all approach to online shopping experiences does not work,\" Whitelaw said.   \"Retailers all recognised that returns are damaging their profitability and in a highly competitive landscape they need to address the fit issues but also offer personalised experiences to engage and retain their customer loyalty.\"  As it currently stands, a retailer can use the To Me Love Me solution by integrating the API into their platform. Whitelaw explained the To Me Love Me algorithms provide two main outcomes: allowing the end customer to gain an \"accurate read\" on their body, shape, size, and style, and then browse through the retailer's website or app accordingly, effectively removing items that would not suit their requirements. The customer simply inputs their body measurements and answers six profiling questions, which Whitelaw said help the algorithm understand \"who they are, what they love, and what they are looking for\".  \"Being white label means it looks, sounds and feels like the [retailer's] brand, offering integral data to power their performance,\" Whitelaw added. \"The granular data we can provide retailers not only assist with the short term need to improve customer experiences to drive better buying behaviours but will assist them in their production, which talks to long term goals in order to operate on the most profitable business model.\"  Currently testing its solution, the startup is looking to target the women's fashion space first up, in particular brands catering to professional women high high disposable income between the ages of 25 and 45, such as Country Road Group, Sass & Bide, and Zimmerman.  The startup will look to offer a tiered pricing model where each tier gives retailers access to various features, for example extending the solution to just their VIP customers. \"Our technology is built to be modular as we understand one size does not fit all,\" Whitelaw said.  With the problem To Me Love Me is trying to solve so significant, there are a number of other startups looking to address it in a variety of ways, from those offering specially tailored or customised clothing made to order through to apps allowing shoppers to virtually 'try on' items.  However, Whitelaw believes To Me Love Me offers a solid medium.  \"What makes us unique is that we offer a dovetail solution; we don't just get your fit right, we go one step further, by personalising your experiences so they are relevant to you.\"  Winning an eCommerce-focused pitching competition held by Startup Victoria earlier this month, To Me Love Me is now focused on running a free pilot program with an Australian retailer to test its technology in a live environment before bringing on paying customers.

    "title": "H2 Accelerator opens up to data and AI startups across Australia and New Zealand",
    "content": "Investment firm H2 Ventures has announced that it will be expanding its flagship H2 Accelerator program to support data and artificial intelligence (AI) startups across Australia and New Zealand. To promote the accelerator, the firm will be conducting a tour across a number of Australia's capital cities and Auckland, leading discussions focused on fintech, data, and female entrepreneurship. Speaking to Startup Daily about the announcement, H2 founding Partner Toby Heap said the expansion has been sitting in H2's backend for some time, as the firm waited for the right timing in terms of commercialisation within the AI and data industries. \"Everyone's seen it coming for a long time, and as you know timing is everything with startups,\" he said. \"We've already had this keen interest in data and AI and then given that we saw that this was the way the world was going, we really felt strongly that the next decade is really going to be sort of driven by changes in the way we use data and AI. \"Years ago, I think if you tried to do it you'd need a lot of effort to convince people it's a good idea. Now it's a good time in terms of product uptake, if you look at all the corporations they've really taken this technology on board. Investors also know about the technology and are willing to get onto it.\" Giving participants $100,000 in funding in exchange for 10 percent equity, the H2 Accelerator had traditionally been open exclusively to fintech startups before starting to venture outside the box for its first 2017 intake. To facilitate an even broader scope of businesses, the accelerator is doubling its participant numbers from last year, moving from eight startups to sixteen. Heap said the firm is also looking to expand its reach outside of NSW, where the majority of startups who participate in the program traditionally reside. \"That's why we're doing the roadshow. We're hoping by going out and visiting the capital cities we'll get a lot more teams from outside NSW who are hopefully prepared to join the program for six months,\" he said. \"[Also] if you're doing something focused on verticals, there's a lot of people out there working away on their ideas. Especially on a space just breaking through like this, you want all those people to realise look there's someone here willing to support them.\" Helping lead the accelerator will be H2 Ventures VC Associate Zach Gazak, who Heap said was brought on last year in anticipation of the firm \"heading in this direction\". Gazak formerly led Silicon Valley data accelerator Insight as a Program Director, and will now be bringing his expertise to H2 Accelerator. The next cohort will commence in August, with the H2 tour set to progress throughout May. You can read about the program here. ",

    "title": "How global customer support startup Freshdesk approached growth in Australia",
    "content": "It may have now amassed 100,000 customers around the world, enabled by a US$50 million Series E round raised in early 2015, but Australia has a special place in the heart of Chennai-based Freshdesk, with Western Australian Atwell College being its first paying customer. With Freshdesk, a company creating customer support and helpdesk solutions, having taken particular care to cultivate its Australian customer base, it now has over 7,000 clients across the country, among them the likes of Showpo and TeleResult. As Nishant Rao, the company's outgoing global COO, put it, it's \"a market you just have to play in\". \"Australia is incredibly important; the US, the UK, and Australia are the three huge countries you absolutely have to go to,\" he said. The company established a local office in Sydney two years ago, led by general manager of Freshdesk Australia Sreelesh Pillai, and has since tripled its employee count, with Rao believing this presence was critical in onboarding customers. \"We don't want to follow the model of, let's get the revenues and only then put resources down; we think, let's actually do what's right for the country and make sure that any customer that comes actually is supported. Groups like customer success or marketing should all be there before,\" he explained. \"A lot of companies will wait for revenue to get to a certain size then invest, but we wanted to flip that on its head: let's get the critical mass we need to make sure our customers are happy, because we know if they're happy, they'll bring other customers, and it will enable us to scale.\" Rao joined Freshdesk in late 2015, leaving his post as managing director of LinkedIn India. He had transferred to India two years earlier from LinkedIn's Mountain View office, having lived in the US for almost two decades. The move back came, as many do, for a mix of personal and professional reasons: Rao's wife was expecting the couple's third child and they began to consider where they wanted their kids to grow up, while Rao also saw a huge opportunity to grow professionally in India. \"Asia Pacific in general is such an exciting region to be part of; sometimes what happens in the US is you can get quite US-centric in your thinking, but in a globalised world it's important to understand the nuances, where Australia is completely different to India, which is completely different to Malaysia. Until you really get into it, you can't really fathom that,\" he said. \"The opportunity popped up to run LinkedIn India, then Freshdesk happened and it was almost the reverse, where LinkedIn had gone great, everything was in place, so I thought, maybe it's time to do the opposite and take an Indian company global and really help this hyper-growth startup really put into place the foundations it will need to scale.\" Understanding and navigating the Asia-Pacific market has also been a fun challenge for Rao, who said he saw early on that there is no uniform market. \"It's a good challenge, forcing you to think differently about go to market strategy and positioning in a market, so I think it makes you a much more well-rounded business leader,\" he said. Also helping him further develop as a business leader was the nature of his new workplace, with Rao finding Indian offices to be much younger to those in the US. He said, \"On the plus side it's been great working with young folks with energy, but at the same time they're all very new to professional life, so my whole management style had to change based on that.\" After wrapping up Freshdesk's annual Customer Happiness Tour, a series of global events bringing together local businesses to look at how they can deliver better service to their customers and staff, Rao recently announced he would be leaving the company and transferring to Delhi. With Freshdesk having grown by over 600 employees around the world during Rao's time as COO, he said it's well placed to help its target market of small to medium businesses grow. He said, \"If you go after the 50 biggest companies out there, you're solving for revenue, but if you go for the millions you're solving for happiness, because if those businesses are happy their customers will be happy, and that's the vision for Freshdesk.\" ",

    "title": "Perth startup Hi Oscar is taking on the rideshare market by tackling safety and surge pricing",
    "content": "After a wild night out in the city, nothing beats being able to whip out your phone and quickly order your own personal driver to take you straight home to your front door. Ridesharing has rapidly evolved into a social norm over the last few years, as it's become no longer frowned upon to be seen stepping inside a stranger's vehicle, complete with dark tinted windows, at night. While ridesharing industry leader Uber's booming popularity has made it a household name and a favourite success story for budding entrepreneurs, recent news has shown the flip side of the coin. Between claims of a sexist company culture and shady methods of overcoming regulatory hurdles, another issue putting the company in the spotlight is surge pricing, a problem which has, like the others, been floating in the background for some time. A new player in the ridesharing place looking to tackle the issue of sure pricing to benefit both drivers and passengers is Hi Oscar. The Perth-based startup wants to combine \"all the thing drivers and users of rideshare apps want\" into one app, offering a more transparent, fair marketplace that diverges from others' less than stellar track record in terms of safety, dealing with sexual harassment, and surge pricing. For those who haven't heard of the issue before, surge pricing abuse, in essence, occurs when drivers forcibly create 'surge areas' - spaces which are subject to Uber's higher multiplying surge fees. These spaces traditionally emerge when an area holds a low number of drivers, a feature which can be abused when multiple drivers agree to switch their apps off and cheat the system into thinking there are none around, hence increasing the price for passengers. Hi Oscar cofounder Daniel Broughton had come across the issue - along with a bundle of other problems rideshare drivers were facing - when he was conducting research for another project. \"People talk about things on forums where things like that are openly discussed,\" he said. \"There are a lot of honest drivers out there that don't like surge and won't be part of it, but there is colluding from a driver's perspective that I've heard about. It impacts riders too, since they'll agree on a pickup zone yet when they call the driver, they might pull the pickup location inside a surge zone if they're nearby it.\" To gain further insight into price surging abuse and the wider issues rideshare drivers face firsthand, Startup Daily spoke to Linda* - who spoke on the condition of anonymity - an Uber driver currently operating in Perth. Linda began driving for the platform early last year, with the on-off style of the job fitting perfectly into her lifestyle. Although her time as a driver started out smoothly, she soon discovered \"colluding\" occurring between drivers to surge prices in areas around Perth. \"It's a rort, and Uber knows that,\" she said. \"When I first started driving for Uber, they told me to go to the surge areas after I complained and told them I wasn't making the amount I was told I would. I'd drive towards [surge areas] on my map, but they would fade out as I approach it. So the advice was then turn off your app as you're approaching.\" Linda quickly discovered that some of her fellow drivers had been working together to make prices surge. Some drivers later approached her asking if she'd like to join in, to which she declined due to the ethical inappropriateness. \"It's unfair to the riders where they're put in the situation where they have to pay quadruple the amount to go home. I just do not go to surge areas now, and a lot of other drivers I know do the same,\" she said. Realising this, Broughton developed Hi Oscar's system without surge prices, as a way to benefit passengers. There are no extra charges for the different types of vehicles on the platform either, meaning riders don't have to pay extra if they require a larger car for their travel. Broughton did say, however, that the startup would examine the possibility of adding weekend fees in the future, although it's not currently on the cards. Also looking to empower riders with choice, the Hi Oscar app allows users to pick which driver they want by tapping on a car on the Google Maps interface. Cars are also coloured based on the driver's gender, allowing riders to choose a driver they feel safest with. This feature, in combination with a number of others, has pushed Linda to begin the transition from driving for Uber to driving for Hi Oscar. \"Occasionally as a female driver I've had to pull over and ask someone to exit the car for inappropriate behaviour and sexual interactions,\" she said. \"[Then], at the end of the day, those riders can still rate you, and can rate you low, especially if you kick them out of the car. Then once that rating's in there, it's in the cogs and won't go away.\" Addressing this rating problem and its impact on drivers, Hi Oscar has developed a rating system using \"thumbs up, thumbs down\", to combat a few outlier ratings damaging a driver's profile. Yet, for Linda, one of the largest draws to Hi Oscar was the deduction of GST from each transaction, meaning drivers don't have to pay their own tax on the side. During her time at Uber, Linda said she had initially been told she would make between $45 to $50 an hour, making the paying of GST less of a financial burden, although she found that wasn't the case. \"It was really $20 to $35 dollars an hour, without taking into consideration car lease, GST, and so on. They didn't really mention GST either, you have to find out about it in a roundabout way,\" she said. Told by the company that their lawyers were working on tackling the legislation for rideshare drivers, Linda took the initiative in her own hands and received a ruling from the tax department for herself, saying that GST would be deducted out of Uber's driver fees. Other drivers, however, are still subject to the current legislation. \"Uber hasn't really tackled it since it has no real impact on them,\" she said. Coming across this problem in his research and discovering a lot of drivers were \"unhappy\", Broughton ensured that Hi Oscar includes GST. Of course, this means a slight increase in the cost of the ride to compensate for the amount deducted from the driver's earnings. Although riders have to pay more, Broughton said he's confident the platform will be able to draw customers away from other ridesharing competitors, especially if there's a strong driver network backing Hi Oscar. \"The appetite in Australia is that most riders feel like fares are too cheap, in fact really low. [Plus] in this economy, people are choosing homegrown. People are supporting the boutique outlets even if they cost a little more,\" he said. Each driver that signs up must hold an omni-bus licence, as a way to ensure they're covered in an accident. The startup has been focusing on growing its driver network, with Broughton saying the business is onboarding 10 to 15 new drivers each week, many of which are moving from existing rideshare platforms. As the next move for the business, Broughton said Hi Oscar will progress into the Northern Territory as it becomes more \"legislated\" by installing stricter safety rulings around rideshare drivers. Beyond that, the startup wants to grow as \"quickly as possible\" while retaining its fundamental qualities, a task which Broughton acknowledged as tough, to say the least. \"Let's be honest, it's a David and Goliath story. We need all the feedback we can get, so it's really encouraging when you get it and know you're heading in the right direction. And I'm confident we can get there.\" *Linda is not the real name of the source contacted. ",

    "content": "ASX-listed Xped, an Adelaide company working in the Internet of Things space, has announced its acquisition of local machine learning and AI startup Jemsoft for $200,000 in cash and 50 million Xped shares, which are currently at 1.4 cents. Founded in 2013 by Jordan Green and Emily Rich, Jemsoft's work originally centered around a security solution for the retail industry that would have cameras analyse people as they approach a store in order to determine whether they are a genuine customer or may pose a threat, with the idea having come from Green's experience being held at gunpoint during a robbery. This technology developed into Jemsoft's Monocular API platform, which has over the years been used by companies in varying industries; according to Xped, the startup has completed projects for clients including global conglomerates, SMEs, government, and other startups. Green said, \"Xped's success doing deals with companies in the US and China, specifically with device manufacturers and the successes they've had in gaining adoption of their technology at the chip and module levels, showed us they're the right partner to fulfil our vision of providing the most usable and accessible cognitive computing products and services in the world.\" With Rich and Green to stay on with the company, as part of the deal Xped will acquire Monocular, Jemsoft's intellectual property, and the 51 percent share the startup has in Media Intelligence Co (MIC), a joint venture created through a partnership with academic Dr Karen Nelson-Field last year. MIC, which provides media companies and brands media measurement solutions and real-time insights, has a cornerstone research contract in place with Think TV Australia, which generates $500,000 a year in licensing fees. \"This acquisition adds a substantial piece in Xped's larger vision of building a complete end-to-end Internet of Things platform,\" Xped said in a statement. \"By leveraging Jemsoft's advanced software and cloud-based expertise, Xped will implement leading artificial intelligence and consumer friendly technologies into its platform.\" The acquisition comes at an interesting time, with The Advertiser reporting that Nelson-Field is taking Jemsoft to Federal Court, applying to wind up the company due to a debt of over $67,000 from consultancy work she did in early 2016. With a hearing scheduled for May 24, Nelson-Field told The Advertiser she had had no notice of the acquisition. Xped earlier this year secured deals with Chinese electronics manufacturer Lenze Technology, which will see its software integrated into more than 200 million devices, and with Solekai Systems, with its tech to be integrated into the platforms of Solekai's existing customers, such as energy management systems, media players, and set top boxes.

    "title": "Aglo is crowdsourcing shoppers to provide brands with data about their products in stores",
    "content": "While getting a brand to stand out online is often described as a daunting task, what's often forgotten about is the similar difficulties that come with getting a product to flourish in store. Woolworths alone works with over 3,100 food suppliers, with many offering tens to hundreds of products from local and international brands - that means more food products than we'll ever be able to get through, even at our hangriest. Helping brands get their products to stand out on the supermarket shelf through first-hand customer data is Sydney-based startup Aglo. Using a crowdsourcing model, Aglo's app allows shoppers to earn cash for completing gamified \"missions\" while they're browsing a store. As an alternative to hiring brand representatives or marketing researchers, brands are able to access first-hand consumer data about their product for a significantly cheaper cost. The \"retail intelligence\" provider was imagined by cofounder David Wong and Mark Jordan, with Wong previously working in the customer relationship management (CRM) space for online business Oracle, putting together data for large global brands including Coke. Data implemented into the business's online software was harnessed using the approach most brands take, involving sending reps to a store to perform an analysis on a product and inform how it's performing on the shelf. With a number of traditional processes for data collection moving digital, this model, according to Wong, had grown stale. \"So currently the solution is to send a sales rep or market researcher into the store, but the issue with that it's obviously expensive, since you need to pay the salaries. We thought these days nearly all shoppers have smartphones connected to the cloud, so why don't we crowdsource this process,\" he said. Having a product gain visibility on the shelf is essential for a brand, as Wong explained there's a huge challenge for brands when gearing up their once online-only products for a life on the shelf in a store. Nearly all brands, particularly in the food industry, won't be able to afford their own 'exclusive' store to showcase their products, meaning they're forced to compete on the packed shelves of a huge chain. \"They have a challenge in understanding what's happening in the store. A lot sell through wholesalers. They have a lot of visibility of how they're products are leaving the warehouse, but once it hit the shelves it's a bit of a black hole,\" said Wong. Wong added that for brands, selling a product in bricks and mortar stores is still increasingly relevant; while the online retail space is growing globally, reaching above $20 billion last year, according to data from the National Australia Bank issued in August last year, Wong claimed \"ninety percent\" of retail sales still occur within physical stores rather than online. \"We're providing richer information of what's going on in store, since to grow shop presence, you need to understand how you're going on the shelf,\" said Wong. Seeing the increase of crowdsourcing models used to innovate in other spaces, Wong saw an opportunity to apply it to the retail intelligence space. Amongst the shelf of startups using crowdsourcing models is Western Australian startup Demand.film, which pays influences to promote cinema films, while Wellington startup SuchCrowd applies crowdsourcing to ticketing events. \"[Crowdsourcing] is an existing process in other spaces, so why not it here to have customers gather information while in the store using their smartphone. For the brands, it's cheaper and they get to expand that they can collect information,\" said Wong. Aglo serves brands through an online web platform, which provides them with a database they can use to visualise and access data. Any employee is able to login to the platform, which can be connected to a brand's CRM tools such as Salesforce. Brands are then able to transfer any data collected through Aglo to their previously established database for \"internal\" use. To begin gathering data, brands are able to launch \"campaigns\", based on how many stores their product is featured in. These campaigns fund both the startup and the shopper, who uses the Aglo app to view all the available missions in their local area, with each detailing what shop and location the shopper will have to travel to. By tapping on a mission, a shopper is able to 'lock' it in, granting them exclusive access to complete it. Once in a store, shoppers are tasked to take a picture of the product and complete a small list of questions, asking them what position the product has on the shelf and whether they can see the price, for example, before the data is sent to Aglo's internal term for review. \"It goes into the back end so we can check that it's valid and do a GPS check so we can check that they're actually in the store, not just taking a picture of a screenshot. It's then passed onto the business,\" Wong explained. Aglo users can participate in the review process too - using the app, they can sign up to receive another shopper's mission and complete a series of checks to validate it, earning a small pocket of cash in the process. Cash is also earnt for successfully completing missions. \"They have a digital wallet which shows their balance. They can then hit the cashout button, send us their PayPal details, and we'll credit them,\" said Wong. Having entered the market over a year ago, the startup wants to expand its customer base by showing brands that there's a cheaper, digital way to gather information about their products. ",

    "title": "Coworking space for international students Outcome-Hub launches in Melbourne",
    "content": "Victorian startup Outcome.Life has today launched a new hub at the edge of Melbourne's CBD in Carlton, dubbed Outcome-Hub. The coworking space will support international students looking to launch their own startup, with the aim of strengthening Victoria's growing startup ecosystem. Funded by the Victorian Government's LaunchVic and private investors, Outcome-Hub will look to tap into Victoria's 175,000 international students, offering them a space where they can transition from their degrees towards developing their business ideas. Designed by students at Melbourne's RMIT University, the space will offer a number of facilities including offices, stand up desks, and kitchens, as well as the expected event and meeting spaces. The hub will also be plugged into a high speed internet network, and host regular social and networking events to encourage collaboration. Domenic Saporito, cofounder of Outcome.Life, said it will be \"breaking down the barriers\" for international students who have innovative ideas by facilitating a space of like-minded people who are able to \"empower\" each other. \"A key focus of Outcome.Life is the integration and collaboration between those who were not born in Melbourne, and long established Melbournians and businesses. It is this integration of networks that proves to be the most powerful and successful in accelerating the startups of internationals,\" said Saporito. Previously speaking to Startup Daily about Outcome.Life, cofounder Gerard Holland said the startup had received a lot of feedback from students saying they wanted to start their own business in Australia. \"A lot of their parents back home have their own business, so they've grown up with it, and have this drive to do the same thing,\" he said. Outcome.Life is an online community for international students, currently working to develop a platform to help connect international students to internship roles to prepare them for real world jobs. The business wants to place a tight focus on connecting students to jobs within startups, as a way to support the ecosystem while providing the students with quality experience. \"Employers are definitely less likely to hire you if you don't have the experience, so is the best to get these international students prepared for the jobs,\" said Holland. Discussing the support received from LaunchVic to develop the hub, Holland said it comes as a way to encourage the international students who are being educated in Australia to remain local and contribute their ideas to the local startup ecosystem. \"If they're going to start a business once they graduate, we want them to start it here and grow it here, because that's going to help the ecosystem in Victoria and the whole of Australia,\" he said. Further attracting international talent to Victoria, LaunchVic has also provided $2.5 million in funding to support the expansion of Silicon Valley startup accelerator 500 Startups to Australia earlier this year. Set to kick off later in the year, the accelerator will accept 20 to 25 startups from across Australia and the wider Asia Pacific region. ",

    "title": "Property Connect's LiveOffer platform wants to make the rental application and offer process fairer",
    "content": "A focus of the Budget earlier this week, housing affordability is a key issue for many Australians, whether they're looking to buy or rent - put up for rent for the tidy sum of $130 a week yesterday was a tent in a Sydenham backyard in Sydney. With the rental market becoming increasingly competitive, the announcement a few weeks ago that San Francisco startup RentBerry would be launching in Australia later this year caused a wave of concern. The platform allows property managers to list rental properties and have applicants bid against each other to win the rental. Ned Cutcher, senior policy officer and the Tenants Union of NSW, told Domain, \"Bidding wars are really only designed for one thing - and that is to push prices up.\" A homegrown alternative, LiveOffer, aims to make things fairer. While also having applicants to bid on a rental, LiveOffer allows them to tailor their offer according to factors such as the length of the lease they're looking for, date they're willing to move in, and how much they're willing to pay, the platform has an algorithm that works with the applicant to help find them better deals. The platform has been built by ASX-listed Property Connect, whose founder and CEO Tim Manson believes \"pure, eBay-style\" rental bid platforms cost everyone both time and money. \"Dealing just with rent has two consequences. One, it pushes up rental prices because that's the only lever applicants can pull to increase their chances. Two, it results in more rental churn because an applicant that wants an apartment for $300 a week for two years will be beaten by someone who wants it for $350 for six months,\" he said. Manson had first seen the need for tech to fix the problems in the rental offer system while working in his family's real estate business in Sydney. \"On the tenant's side we'd see the same applicants popping up for the same kind of properties but just getting pipped, which is always frustrating. It's so time consuming,\" he said. \"On the landlord's side we'd see apartments that went vacant until the tenant could move in, which costs them money, or we'd see tenants that moved out after less than 12 months when the landlord had wanted a long-term deal. It was maddening for everyone.\" Saying the need for something better was obvious, Manson decided to create it - the only problem was, he said, \"I know real estate, but I don't know technology.\" He hired a developer to bring the platform to life, sinking both his own money and that of a few friends who had invested in the idea, but emerged without a product. Covering the costs of redevelopment, LiveOffer emerged in 2012. The platform works by having agents or property managers list rental properties, ranking various criteria an applicant must meet according to importance. After prospective tenants submit applications detailing whether they meet the criteria, as well as other factors such as how much they are willing to pay or when they can move in, LiveOffer will rank all applicants based on how well they satisfy the criteria. Applicants are able to see their ranking, and in turn revise their offer up until the end of the bidding period. Property Connect earns an upfront conversion fee, as well as a percentage of the property's rent based on the term of the lease. The aim of the platform, Manson said, is to make the rental offer process transparent, and bring out into the open things that are already happening behind the scenes. \"You can offer more than the listed price for a rental apartment. You can also offer less and say you're willing to move in sooner for longer. In my experience in the real estate industry, that is just as likely, if not more likely, to get a landlord's attention, because it covers a potential lost revenue period when their property is empty and it gives them long-term certainty,\" he said. \"The reality is that this is already taking place without the applicant's knowledge. If you call up a real estate agent after a property has been showcased and say, 'I'll offer $10 extra per month, move in the moment the apartment is vacant and for 12 months,' you'll get it.\" Though starting the business in Australia, Manson moved it to the US a few years ago to take advantage of the lower cost of living, easier access to tech talent, and the larger property market. As well as helping the startup develop its tech, Manson said the move helped shape its offering, with the multifamily housing market a big one to tap into. Multifamily housing, as Manson explained it, is five or more apartments under one title, which means an owner can't sell each apartment off individually; essentially, this means it is built to be rented out. \"The consequence of putting something under the one title is certain building codes and permits don't have to be followed, which reduces the cost of construction. The result is that the owner can offer cheaper rental accomodation or invest in better facilities; a lot of the time they do both,\" he said. Developing LiveOffer with clients in the multifamily housing space in mind, the platform has had to be tweaked for the Australian real estate market. To grow into Australia, the startup has brought on board Charles Tarbey, chairman of Century21 Australa, as its chairman, and is now trialing the LiveOffer platform with a number of Century21 agencies in Victoria and Western Australia. It follows the commercial launch of the platform in the US in March, with the business having signed agreements with two property managers and beginning the onboarding of their properties. Despite the impending local launch of RentBerry, Manson is confident in LiveOffer, saying his background in property has served him in good stead through the platform's development and growth and will continue to do so. \"Property is my background; I developed LiveOffer from my hands-on experience in the Sydney rental markets. I know the balance that needs to be struck between real estate agents, landlords and tenants. Anyone moving into this space without striking that balance won't last long,\" he said. ",

    "title": "Australian not-for-profits morphing into digital businesses, NFP Innovation Index finds",
    "content": "The Australian not-for-profit (NFP) sector is increasingly adopting new technology to go about its work, its innovation chops rising nine percent over the last 12 months to 63.3 in the 2017 NFP Innovation Index. The Index, which measures an organisation's capabilities across areas including technology, internal and external collaboration, their openness of culture and vision, and stakeholder centricity, was compiled by digital fundraising platform GiveEasy, with support from Australia Post, Westpac, and the Australian Graduate School of Management (AGSM). Jonas Tobias, CEO of GiveEasy, said NFPs have shifted from simply trying to keep up with innovation to actually embracing and embedding innovative practices into their organisations. \"NFPs are now morphing into digital businesses, as the analogue approach is slow and time consuming. The digital economy speeds up the process of bringing new products to market, providing access to a wider donor community and new opportunities for collaboration,\" he said. In transitioning into 'digital businesses', the Index found NFPs are buying into online trends to expand their existing communities and reach new audiences, embracing the likes of online marketing and digital fundraising platforms, and exploring digital collaboration opportunities. The top fundraising strategies among the high innovators are donations via the organisation's website, fundraising events, email campaigns, and peer to peer sites. Innovation in the area of stakeholder centricity also saw a particularly high jump, from a score of 50.7 in last year's Index to 62.2, as organisations come to understand they must do more to put their partners, donors, and customers at the heart of what they do. \"As NFPs exist to serve their beneficiaries, improved stakeholder focus is great news. Highly innovative NFPs are collaborating more with their communities, employees, volunteers and beneficiaries. Increasingly the service experience is more approachable, more human, which matches the public perception of the sector,\" Tobias said. However, an area requiring more work is that of rewarding and recognising employees, with just two percent of employees surveyed stated they feel comfortable enough to question the status quo, and 10 percent feeling that taking informed risks is encouraged. The most innovative NFPs, according to the Index, are the Cure Brain Cancer Foundation, Movember Foundation, and Cerebral Palsy Alliance, while the top innovators as voted by the community are Thankyou, Movember, and Beyondblue. Alongside these older NFPs, a growing number of social enterprise startups are emerging around Australia. To help the community further develop, the Victorian Government earlier this year released a Social Enterprise Strategy, announcing $5 million in funding to further increase the impact of and innovation in the state's social enterprise sector, build business capacity and skills, and improve market access. With over 5,000 social enterprises already operating in Victoria and employing more than 75,000 people, Robin Scott, Victorian Minister for Finance, said, \"We want to encourage more social enterprises into the market by giving the government greater access to their goods and services.\" Addressing the aim of increasing impact and innovation, the government's strategy initiatives include 'opening doors for social enterprises', that is, ensuring that it is adequately engaging with the sector, ensuring its various programs are open to social enterprises and that relevant information is available to them.\nThe need to equip entrepreneurs in the NFP or social enterprise space with a digital tools was highlighted in a report produced by the Bankwest Foundation last month. Having followed 10 Western Australian social enterprises for 12 months, report author Dr Chris Mason of Swinburne University, found that while these entrepreneurs are keen and quick to learn, they struggle in the areas of securing external finance, retaining staff, and adapting to market changes. With these organisations small, many entrepreneurs found it difficult to dedicate time and resources to implementing systems that would able them to effectively report on their financial and social performance, which in turn meant investors or potential partners had little information to go off when considering whether to invest or collaborate. Mason said, \"If we could overcome this hurdle it would help these businesses communicate better with potential investors, help them secure funding and help give them a competitive edge in applying for grants and tenders.\"   ",

    "title": "Thank you, Alan Joyce",
    "content": "When an individual takes part in an act of harming, harassing, or humiliating another with the intent of intimidating, influencing or injuring another individual, it is the very textbook and legislated description of bullying in Australia. This week Qantas CEO, Alan Joyce was smacked in the face with a lemon meringue pie in front of an audience at a breakfast for 500 business people in Perth. Why? Because Joyce, an openly gay man, has chosen to create a culture that unapologetically supports the notion of equality in the organisation which he oversees. The question of whether or not he was harmed in the incident is a moot point, while hypothesising around replacing the pie with a knife to demonstrate the potential severity of the situation is also useless commentary from the media that distracts from the skin and bones of the situation. Fact: a man by the name of Tony Overheu made a calculated decision to publicly humiliate another man called Alan Joyce by smacking him in the face with pie because he is different and because he believes in a view of society that opposes his own. There is nothing complicated here. It was a act driven by homophobic beliefs. When people like Tony Overheu or publicly elected officials like Peter Dutton make remarks like \"parliamentary processes are being subverted by activists\" or that publicly known CEOs should \"stick to their knitting\" and not get involved in social policy debates, what they are really saying is that they wish to suppress the voices of individuals in society that have the potential to influence others by sharing their own story or those of employees within their organisation. That is the thing about democracy, everyone gets to express their view - politicians, religious leaders, organisations, business leaders, activists, media commentators, the general public - we all get a go. Society has changed the way it interacts with brands over the last two years in a major way. A myriad of studies conducted from the likes of Forbes, Harvard Business Review and the Australian Institute of Management all resulted in similar findings around the important role that activism now plays in a customer's decision-making process about whether or not to do business with a company. Generally speaking, people are more likely to spend money with organisations that support socio-political views that mirror their own. There is more trust in a CEO that is open and honest about how they feel about a particular subject or topic publicly. The millennial generation does not only favour organisations that take a stance on social issues, they expect it - it influences not just their buying decisions but also plays a major role in their decisions around career opportunities. On reflection, I think that this is why I have been so incredibly vocal about my support and excitement about the Qantas AVRO Accelerator program. Sure I like the layout of the program, the theme-driven selection process, and the opportunity for startup and scaleup companies to leverage the Qantas brand, which will result in a stronger startup ecosystem. But, at the end of the day, I want to work with people and a company that are doing some good in the world, that are unapologetically speaking up on a topic that I feel passionate about. When it comes to Joyce having a pie smashed in his face he has responded with the sentiment of making it clear that the bully should be held accountable for their actions and behaviour - hence pressing charges - and a very clear message to the public, parliament, and corporate Australia that the incident has served only to further invigorate his passion for the fight for marriage equality. For me, a member of the LGBTQI community as a gay man, this reaction means so much more. It means so much more because I have experienced that kind of \"pie in the face\" humiliation before, as have many others in the LGBTQI community through various stages of their lives. How wonderful it is to have an active player at the top end of corporate Australia to look up to and take guide from - a role model for myself and other gay founders and future corporate executives. If you can't see something, it makes it harder to become that something. When I was in high school, media companies like Showtime and NBC and individuals like Ellen DeGeneres were responsible for championing a global conversation around the theme \"it is okay to be gay\" - it was an important step but hardly inspirational. How happy I am that the young gay/bi/confused/questioning or curious men and women in high school all around Australia going through a tough time get something with more substance. They get to see that gay men can be successful business operators, can be powerful influencers on social and political issues, and be inspirational leaders and role models for young people everywhere. Being that type of public leader takes an incredible amount of courage - and you taking that professional risk truly means a lot. Thank you, Alan Joyce. ",

    "title": "Saving the world can be profitable, and a new tool is showing how",
    "content": "With their dollars and reach, entrepreneurs and investors have significant leverage to tackle the world's most pressing problems. A new tool shows them how -- and that it's good for business, too. The Global Opportunity Explorer details out 300 ways companies can engage in \"sustainable innovation,\" leading to better societies as well as new business opportunities. The platform's purpose is to inspire entrepreneurs and investors around the world to see big challenges -- like world hunger, water scarcity, and gender equality -- not as risks, but as potential markets. SEE ALSO: This gripping app lets you 'walk a mile' in a 16-year-old refugee girl's shoes Built and developed by sustainability think tank Sustainia after five years of research with 18,000 business leaders and 17 expert panels, the Global Opportunity Explorer is categorized by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) -- the United Nations' blueprint to make a better world by the year 2030. The site covers 10 business sectors, including food, health, transportation, and technology, which you can pair with an SDG to find tangible solutions. Work in the fashion industry and want to tackle clean water and sanitation? Read about Aura Herbal's technology to use natural dyes for clothing. Work in tech and want to tackle gender equality? Learn about Code to Inspire's initiative to teach Afghan girls how to code. Each example tells you why you should care, and how these efforts address the Global Goals.  The site also features 45 new markets, from smart cities to the regenerative ocean economy, with key statistics on how those markets are expected to grow in the near future. For example, the global market for refrigerated road transportation is expected to grow more than 26 percent between 2017 and 2021, which means the time could be ripe for an innovative startup tackling food waste. \"More and more businesses are seeing the SDGs as inspiration to create innovative solutions that address some of the world's biggest challenges,\" said Lise Kingo, CEO and executive director of the U.N. Global Compact, which helped launch the platform. \"The Global Opportunity Explorer brings all of these solutions into one dynamic place where companies, investors, and entrepreneurs can connect and work together to bring these solutions to scale for real impact,\" she said in a statement.  Image:  Global Opportunity Explorer By compiling all of these solutions in one place, the Global Opportunity Explorer could help companies that want to have more of a sustainable or positive social impact find new partners. If Adidas can join forces with Parley for the Oceans to design a new sneaker made from plastic ocean waste, who knows what other impactful collaborations could pop up.  \"From our position focusing on sustainability, technology, and innovation, we are convinced that existing and new technologies will be combined and drive solutions supporting the world's 2030 agenda,\" said Bjorn K. Haugland, chief sustainability officer at DNV GL, a Norwegian engineering firm that worked on the platform. The Global Opportunity Explorer launched in late April with 300 solutions, but it isn't finished by any means. The creators want \"continuous co-creation and crowdsourcing\" to expand the platform and tap into the countless good ideas for sustainable innovation still out there. Anyone can submit their ideas here.  ",

    "title": "Transportation as a service (TaaS): a look ahead",
    "content": "SoftBank Group just invested $5 billion in China's Didi Chuxing, China's biggest ride-sharing service. Last year Uber sold their China business to Didi resolving (by giving up) all the legal and antitrust investigations it was undergoing in China. In other news, Chris Urmson, CTO of Google's self-driving car program for many years, left to start a new company. In a recent lecture at CMU, Chris Urmson who got his PhD from and taught at CMU, co-founder and CEO of self-driving car startup Aurora and part of the DARPA Urban and Grand Challenge teams, described three major transitions involving self-driving cars and said that \"It's a wonderful time to be a roboticist.\" (Urmson's new startup, Aurora, will develop software, hardware, and data to sell to automakers who want to build their own autonomous cars.) Chris predicts an inevitable shift to EVs, a change in the ownership concept to transportation services, and dramatic changes in manufacturing and jobs in what used to be the auto industry and will soon be the transportation services industry. Urmson attributes the shift in thought from gradually adding more self-driving features until it becomes time to remove the pedals and steering wheel - the stated posture of most of the auto industry - to using deep learning and simulation training to be able to directly go to self-driving cars - the position taken by Google, Ford, and many of the new startups - as a particularly important contribution made by Google. Later in his lecture, when answering a question about the state of the robotics industry versus the state of the art being developed in universities and research labs such as CMU, he lauded the deep pockets that business - and especially Google - brings to research in general and self-driving cars in particular.  I've set this video of his presentation entitled 'Perspectives on Self-Driving Cars' to begin at a particularly interesting spot where Urmson describes the transition to transportation as a service. You may want to watch the whole video -- it's very informative.  The traditional transportation model, where a person owns and drives his or her own car, is in flux. The shift to Transportation as a Service (TaaS) radically changes ownership from individual owners to fleet owners and negates the need for so much space devoted to parking and repair facilities. I've written about the many other stakeholders going to be effected by this transformation but here's one very large group that opens up a whole new world of opportunity: what's going to happen to home garages and carports in the age of TaaS? Who are the stakeholders that are going to benefit just in that little world (think Home Depot)? Urmson lays out a timeframe for these transformations: fully autonomous cars begin hitting the road within 5 years and become widely accepted within 20 years.  PriceWaterhouseCoopers confirms those forecasts and projects nearly 20% of auto industry revenues and 36% of profits will shift from auto sales to services by 2030. Yet The New York Times just did a story about how China is ramping up their auto industry to become competitive so that they can begin exporting their cars as well as domestically outsell the international automakers producing and selling their cars in China. Is this a big bubble waiting to burst? Autonomous driving will certainly encounter speed bumps and take longer to implement than many may predict. Regulatory issues seem the most important potential holdups and have to be resolved before any real momentum can begin. Right now states regulate drivers while the federal government regulates manufacturers. How is that going to change? And how quickly? What other unforeseen delays can we expect?  This story is just beginning. As one who has seen, admired, and looked inside Mercedes' concept self-driving car, I can't wait to ask Alexa to have one outside my place in 10 minutes so I can go to dinner. << Return to The Robot Report Frank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global(tm) Robotics & Automation Index.

    "title": "David Greenberg of Updater on Disruption and Thinking Outside the Box",
    "content": "Always following \"best practices\" isn't necessarily best for your own unique business. In the startup world especially, the further outside the box you think, the better. And if you don't believe us, take a look at this inspiring interview. David Greenberg is the founder & CEO of Updater, the technology company revolutionizing how Americans move. By changing the industry, he set himself up for success while completing transforming the moving process. Check out an interview with him below: I really admire Michael Bloomberg, both for what he's done as a business leader and for his contributions as a philanthropist. Don't be afraid to veer off the typical pathway for fundraising and growing your business. Every business is different, so consistently following \"best practices\" is generally not a good practice. With so much well-documented advice out there today from venture capitalists and other entrepreneurs, take it all in but view everything with skepticism. You need to figure out the \"best practice\" for your own unique business. Only you can figure that out - not an outsider. There are three big mistakes that I made early on in my journey as an entrepreneur: I tend to stay up very late at night working from home on investor relations and strategy. Therefore, I come into the office on the later side, usually between 10 and 11 a.m. By the time I arrive, there are many emails waiting for me and it takes me that first hour to respond to the urgent ones. I hate slowing down my team, so I try to respond quickly to internal requests for advice or help. My team is familiar with the late night/late morning routine, so they send any urgent requests in the morning during my first hour - we're in a great rhythm! After that first hour, though, I try not to check my email again until much later in the day. For technology companies that aren't cash flow positive, your cash is your lifeline. You need to accomplish certain key milestones before running low on money so that you'll be well positioned to raise more. The biggest cash flow mistake is actually wasting time on things that don't move the needle to help you raise more money. Time is money, and you need to spend nearly all of your time accomplishing the milestones that will enable you to raise more money. Don't take your eye off of this for even a day. Spending time on other things increases your risk of going broke. How about two things? You know those people at your company who you know - deep down - aren't a good fit or are causing problems? Time to let them go. Also, you know how - deep down - you need someone amazing to take either your sales, product, marketing or engineering to the next level? Time to go find and fiercely recruit that person. Your success or failure is just a function of the people around you. I believe that success is achieved when your business does two things: changes an industry for the better, and makes people happy, both your employees and your customers.

    "title": "4 Keys to Developing Multi-Device Apps in a BYOD World",
    "content": "Many people have an awkward epiphany the first time they see \"BYOB\" emblazoned at the bottom of a party invitation. Far from a typo, the common abbreviation for \"bring your own bottle\" has been a staple of the American social scene for several decades. In the same way BYOB has influenced social circles, a new acronym has started to shape the way we work. BYOD -- short for \"bring your own device\" -- has become increasingly prevalent in modern enterprises. According to a Tech Pro Research study, 74 percent of organizations permit employees to bring their own electronic devices to work. By most accounts, it's a positive trend for both businesses and employees. The policy allows companies to eliminate the expenses associated with purchasing and managing computers, tablets, or smartphones that employees might never use. Employees are often more productive and happy using their own devices because they're already familiar with how they operate. The sudden surge of BYOD policies has created the need for enterprise-grade applications to work across a wide range of devices, ensuring security and productivity for workers and organizations alike. Affording employees more freedom and control over the devices they use for work is generally a prudent move. But considering the prevalence of new technologies and wearables, the apps of tomorrow must accommodate a wide range of platforms. Here are four elements business leaders and app developers should consider: This lets you identify users, monitor their connections, and restrict access. Multi-device apps require solid authentication, which could be accomplished via a username and password or through more advanced features, such as biometric fingerprints or a two-factor authentication code. This determines what a user can and cannot see and do inside a system. This is where user privileges come in. Let's say your app streams data from IoT sensors to an employee. An access manager API could allow you to grant and revoke permission to consume that data. It also could regulate which subsets of employees have access to certain data streams, restricting access when necessary. This is a necessity, as it allow you to provision and update a multi-device app across your entire ecosystem. These updates can be done on the fly in real time, eliminating the need for employees to install updates on their own. You could deploy an app-only management strategy, focusing on a single application and how you store and share sensitive data on devices. This approach leaves device management to the user, with firmware updates and provisioning handled via the application. This must occur across multi-device apps, and a user on multiple devices should see the same data in both places. This is achieved through two real-time designs: pub/sub and data sync. Pub/sub allows users to subscribe to a channel and receive published messages in real time. This bidirectional design makes it possible for streaming data to display on a real-time dashboard or for co-workers to collaborate in a chat app. Data sync, meanwhile, provides \"state\" data that is created, read, updated, and deleted. This data is persistent and kept in sync between clients and back-end processes. The cooperative structure of Google Docs is based on this element.

    "title": "Thomas College Receives $5.3M Alfond Grant for New Center of Innovation",
    "content": "Thomas College announced a new initiative designed to promote innovation and spur entrepreneurial activity in central Maine. The Waterville-based college has created the Harold Alfond Institute for Business Innovation thanks to a $5.3 million donation from The Harold Alfond Foundation. This is the largest gift in the college's nearly 125-year history. In 1956, Harold Alfond founded Dexter Shoe Co. in 1956, is one of Maine's most well-known entrepreneurs. Harold died in 2007 at the age of 93. \"Our mission and vision for this institute is to build on the legacy of Harold Alfond and what he accomplished, not only in the business world but also what he has done to contribute to Maine's economic growth,\" said Laurie Lachance, president of Thomas College's. The institute was designed with three prime objectives, according to Lachance: The institute plans to offer entrepreneurial-minded students a one-week intensive course on entrepreneurship that guide them through how to create a business, the 'Lean Startup' method, business creation, and more. The idea for the institute stems from two-and-a-half years of research, according to the college's press release, including focus groups with roughly 500 business leaders, entrepreneurs and students, to discover what type of business education would be most likely to help students succeed. Greg Powell, the Alfond Foundation's chairman, called the gift \"a smart investment\" in Maine's economic future. \"We believe Laurie's leadership, knowledge of economic development, and vision for how Maine can grow its workforce makes this a smart investment,\" Powell said. \"The foundation is confident that Harold Alfond's entrepreneurial spirit will live on through the work here at Thomas College and the individual business leaders and entrepreneurs that take part in the wide range of opportunities that will be available to them.\" The institute is housed within the college's existing H. Allen Ryan School of Business and will be led by Mike Duguay.

    "title": "Greg Segall of Alyce on Bootstrapping, Giving Back, and His Biggest Mistake",
    "content": "Bootstrapping a startup can be hard. However, what many entrepreneurs that forego funding forget to tell you is that bootstrapping is also one of the most liberating experiences you can have as an entrepreneur. You're free to investor meetings, financial obligations, and essentially having a boss at all. Greg Segall is CEO of Alyce, a bootstrapped and globally sold ecommerce agency. His story of success is rooted in his ability to bootstrap his company and build it from the ground up. Take a look at our interview with him below: Cal Ripken Jr. is my hero. He played the most consecutive games in Major League Baseball history and redefined the shortstop position. Critics told him he was too big to play shortstop, but during his career he proved that it could be a power position. I looked up to him throughout my childhood, and when I was 13 I finally got the chance to meet him. I was seriously the last in line and he had been standing talking to people and signing autographs for six hours. Even with that, when I got my turn he was extremely friendly and chatted me up (even though I barely could get out a word) and I never forgot how that made me feel. Ever since then I try to live my life with the same consistency and positive attitude. Not only do I admire his persistence, but I admired his competitiveness and I mirror that passion. While I always want to win, failing is a natural part of life and it's how you do it gracefully, learn from it and be better the next time around. The simplest advice I can give is: it's who you know... and more importantly, what you do for them that matters. In a book I once read, there was a story about a CEO who had two jars of marbles. One jar was filled with marbles of 'things I have done for others' and the other jar was marbles of 'things others have done for me.' Every day, he moved marbles from one jar to the other, with the goal to always have all the marbles in the 'things I have done for others' jar by the end of the day. I thought that was a great way of putting it. You should give back to people as much as possible, support them, and give honest feedback and opinions without asking for anything in return. By constantly helping others you will expand your network naturally, and create meaningful relationships and connections for life. Thinking I could do it all on my own. When I started my first company I was 22, and thought that I knew (and could do) everything. I didn't talk to anyone about the challenges I faced for the first few years. That stunted my growth personally and my business. Most CEOs are willing to learn from each other, have business relationships, share customers and grow together. Ironically, most of my competitors CEOs are some of my best friends. I spend the first hour of my day playing with my 9-month old daughter. I just focus on hanging out with her. My first hour of \"business\" is usually spent listening to a podcast or reading articles revolving around inspiration or issues I'm looking to solve. It always gets my mind around some new ideas and thoughts as I'm getting prepared for the day. Understand the difference between scheduled revenue, accrued revenue, invoiced revenue and earned revenue. Nailing these will help you point out your liabilities and the true health of your organization. Really understand what your business' balance sheet looks like, not just how much cash is in the bank. Inexperienced business owners tend to focus on the cash, but the cash in the bank is front-loaded, and isn't going to last you as long as you think it will. Do things for other people without expecting things to be done for you. Network and get out there. And be good to people. The karma that comes back and the availability of resources that will open up to you are infinite. I would've been way further ahead in business if I wasn't so closed when I first started off. For two years straight from 2010-2011 (weekends included), I went to coffee, lunch or drinks with someone new who I hadn't met before. I would say two things: Alyce defining an industry (or at least revolutionizing one) and being able to have made a huge impact on the world. In Alyce's case, we're building a culture of giving, training people how to give well, reducing waste and giving back to charity with every gift given on our platform. If we can accomplish this, create a large, tight-knit organization of awesome people all while generating massive profits, that is true success.

    "title": "Startup Spotlight: Golf Wagers, Cow Collars and Take-Out Food",
    "content": "If you're finding yourself shifting gears to the outdoors, maybe hitting the golf course or just soaking in the sun, you'll still have some form of technology by your side. Each week, Tech.Co will be highlighting emerging startups in our spotlight series. This week, we're taking a look at connecting startups with entrepreneurs for help, smart collars for cows, turning those golf course wagers into charitable donations and more. Here are the five startups you need to know: If you've had an idea for a business but needed some validation, feedback and help, look to Crowdholding. This London-based startup connects you with entrepreneurs, allowing you to give feedback and ideas in return for a cut of sales revenue. The Crowdholding cycle begins with Crowdholders co-creating projects with entrepreneurs. Users connect with projects, investing their time as feedback, ideation and marketing, potentially being awarded with \"Crowdshares\" or a share of sales revenue the projects generates. Crowdshares become an exciting new asset that in the future can be sold and even traded legally! While contributing feedback and ideas to the project, one can also develop their skills and talents, build a personal brand and grows as a thought leader. The platform is open to any type of business product and allow startups to validate business ideas, build awareness and raise capital without loss of control. Crowdholding was in the top 6 Fintech startups at Start Summit and won 1st place at xPort Business Accelerator Pitch competition. Monitoring your herd is something critically important to ranchers. Now with technology, tracking the health and location of their cows makes it easier. California-based startup Cowlar, is a smart collar for livestock and is placed on their neck to track temperature, activity and cow behaviour, i.e. whether it's eating, sleeping, ruminating or showing lameness. Through their solar powered routers, real-time data is sent back to the ranchers which will in turn prevent diseases, detect heat cycles and increase milk yield.  For schools, organizations or athletic teams, collecting money from a group is a constant challenges, until now. Denver-based Cheddar Up is the simplest way to collect and track online payments from a group. Organizations can create custom pages where parents or donors can pay through their phone or online in a few clicks, keep track of all the transactions in one location and deposit easily into their account. INOV8 Golf What if you could wager a bet with your friend on the golf course, but instead donate winnings to charity? Phoenix-based startup INOV8 Golf is a media company that  committed to developing fun mobile games that positively impact charitable giving and provide users with the ability to win VIP experiences/prizes. The inspiration for INOV8 Golf is rooted in Founder John Cioe's passion for the game of golf, friendly wagers, and charitable giving. Even musician Alice Cooper's organization has benefited from their innovation. \"I am really pleased to have my organization SolidRock be a beneficiary of an exciting new fundraising platform for charities, ChariTee Fantasy Golf,\" Cooper said.  Helping customers to manage their food orders from their smartphone can be an attractive option for restaurants. This management system is redefining the restaurant experience for customers. This Phoenix-based startup designed this point-of-sale platform specifically for restaurants to help them track orders, review trends, connect with their customer, and turn over tables more efficiently. As for the customers, guests are able to order, pay, and track their takeout orders through their smartphone from their favorite local restaurants. If they prefer an in-dining experience, users can order and pay for their meal from their table. Read about more startups showcased in our Weekly Spotlight here.

    "title": "20-Year-Old Founder Xyla Foxlin on Bars, Plushies, and Being Alienated",
    "content": "Xyla Foxlin strives to be the woman she wishes she had to look up to growing up: passionate and invested in what she does technically, but also maintaining pride in her femininity and external interests including fashion and art. You'll find her in a dress at robotic design reviews, and a blur of pink in the machine shop. Xyla is the 20-year-old CEO and founder of Parihug, the startup behind internet-connected plushes that let you hug loved ones from anywhere in the world, and she first launched the idea back in 2015, at a hack-a-thon as an engineering student. The company won the Readers Choice poll for Tech.Co's SXSW Startup of the Year, but they also recently launched Beauty and the Bolt, an \"online village that is designed to reduce the barrier to entry into makerspaces and the makerspace movement, as well as subtly change the narrative of what an engineer should look, act, and dress like.\" Here's Xyla on her journey and the advice she has for anyone hoping to follow in her footsteps. \"I was in a long-distance relationship at the time, and simply wanted a source of comfort at the end of the day. That sparked the idea, and then it was the technical challenge that really drew me in at first. How on earth do you use a couple simple components to fool the brain into believing something that isn't true? How can a cuddly plush toy detect a hug without becoming an awkward creepy weird robot? Now, much of my motivation stems from people's stories. I absolutely love hearing about supporters' family experiences and why they need Pari-- some of these stories are absolutely tear-jerking.\" \"Up! We are in a really unique position, where we (accidentally) practically invented the consumer tele-intimacy market. There aren't any options for families and loved ones to share emotions over distance the way we do in person-- through touch, smell, taste, etc. There are so many more options than just audio/visual. That said, I hope that changes-- there is a huge difference between telling someone \"I love you\" over Skype, and actually being able to give them a hug. I really want to just focus on connection-- how can we keep making that experience more and more real, and more and more emotional.\" \"Adults, use your imaginations. (Kidding!!) Absolutely. Could I tell you exactly what? Not at all. I personally want to explore the options in therapy for both special needs children and anxiety disorders. Imagine Pari in a NICU, or as an open source platform for therapists to develop on. The possibilities are endless!\" \"For sure, although I think my college and social life was significantly more impacted than my entrepreneur journey. On the startup side, easily the toughest part is (still!) not being 21, since so much networking and startup events happen at bars.  On the social life end of things, it's (understandably) pretty tough as a 20 year old girl to empathize with your roommate who is constantly traveling, putting herself out there, no longer taking classes, and constantly being featured in press. I have definitely felt alienated and even targeted by people whom I considered good friends before I started Parihug, but hope that with time the cattiness will wear off. (Someone once scrawled 'Hugs are overrated' in my dorm elevator.) Those who I'm truly close to say I haven't changed as a person, and I'm very conscious about not talking about startup things when I'm with my old classmates. It's hard to find people my own age who can understand the stress of starting a company.\" \"Learn to be a sponge, and then learn to filter out bullsh*t. Always listen, even if you disagree. You can learn the most from those people.  Surround yourself with a support network that will be there not only when you're successful, but also when you fail. But make sure they are people who don't take joy from when you get knocked down, or are jealous enough that they want to see you fail. The most important things are grit, empathy, and kindness. You need to know how to work through the hardest nights of your life and maintain a (mostly) positive spirit. You also need to be able to empathize with your coworkers, your support network, and your product audience. And be kind! Your mother was right. Volunteer when the opportunity arises, donate your time and efforts, and be nice to everyone. Not only does it make you a good person and is fulfilling, but you never know who will be able to help you in the future.\" ",

    "title": "J.D. Vance on Hillbilly Complexities and Startup Cities",
    "content": "In his book, Hillbilly Elegy, J.D. Vance gives the world insight to his upbringing in Middletown, Ohio where people faced extensive socioeconomic barriers in a poverty-stricken town. From his mother's multiple marriages and growing opioid addiction and absent father to finding sanctuary with his tough-as-nails grandmother Mamaw, J.D. somehow managed to maneuver through the crappy hand he was dealt to become a Marine Corps veteran, graduate of Yale University and one of Silicon's Valley's top venture capitalists. At Columbus Startup Week powered by Chase for Business, J.D. Vance talked with Todd Connor, CEO of Bunker Labs, about his upbringing, how the military shaped his approach to life and business and what is next for his life in Ohio. J.D. said the initial purpose of writing the book was to give people an understanding of the struggles of the American white working class, and a personal analysis of a culture in crisis. \"The more I wrote about the topic and my contribution, I realized that it was a story of my family and my life - and the more I wrote about the people around me, it encouraged me to make it more personal,\" J.D. said. In his description of small town life, the outside world might stereotype these people as simple- it's quite the opposite. \"It's easy [to say we're simple] when you are making a philosophical argument, but we're more complex than that, and confronted with [my family's] complexity, by making the book more personal then I can present that complexity,\" J.D. said.  J.D. admitted he was nervous about writing this book and exposing not only his life and vulnerabilities to the world, especially when he asked Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel to offer his thoughts, but his family's challenges as well. \"I was very uncomfortable to reveal my personal life in intense detail. One way I mitigated the embarrassment with the family was to involve them in the process,\" J.D. said. The book has been regarded as a must read and a #1 New York Times best seller. While Hillbilly Elegy wasn't intended to have a political overtone, as \"Hillary Clinton nor Trump appeared once in the book,\" he said, critics say this book gives insight into the American Trump voter. \"I wanted to make some of the arguments I want to make, it was weird how positive the reaction was,\" J.D. said. \"[The book] was as honest as I could be the moment I published the book.\" As for the critics and trolls, \"It's very easy to become very tribal about criticism the natural reaction is to hunker down and disassociate from it. [However,] it's a useful exercise, take the good with the bad, and not be dismissive about everything.\" For many, the military is considered a positive escape from one's troubled environment. J.D. went on to join the Marine Corps where he learned life lessons that helped him deal with the situation back at home and guide his future. \"For all that we think about the military, that it's this raw, violent environment, the Marine Corps taught me how to deal with people constructively, how to deal with conflict in the real world, and skills to function in the 21st century - skills I didn't learn in my upbringing,\" J.D. said. Fast forwarding to today, J.D. shared how he will be working with Steve Case on his Rise of the Rest Tour that focuses on raising awareness about entrepreneurship happening in other cities as well as launching a non-profit to address the Opioid epidemic in Ohio. \"The Rise of the Rest [goal is to] raise awareness that there are exciting business and entrepreneurs who need funding in some of these rise of the rest cities,\" J.D. said.

    "title": "Study: Being a Workaholic Is Bad for Your Mental Health",
    "content": "You've heard it a thousand times: work really hard and good things will happen. Parents, teachers, coaches, and mentors all use this cliche as a means of motivation. However, taking this innocent advice to the extreme, like most things, ends poorly for those working beyond their limits. And if you still think valuing work over everything else is a good character trait, you need to know that science isn't on your side. According to research out of the University of Norway, conducted by Cecilie Schou Andreaseen, Mark D. Griffiths, Rajita Sinha, Jorn Hetland, and Stale Pallesen, being a workaholic is measurably bad for your mental health. The study focused on ADHD, OCD, anxiety, and depression, all of which were notably increased in those considered workaholics. The research is pretty cut and dry when it comes to the effects of workaholism on mental health. 32.7 percent of workaholics met ADHD criteria, compared to 12.7 percent of non-workaholics. 25.6 percent of workaholics met OCD criteria, compared to 8.7 percent of non-workaholics. 33.8 percent of workaholics met anxiety criteria, compared to 11.9 percent of non-workaholics. And 8.9 percent of workaholics met depression criteria, compared to 2.6 percent of non-workaholics. Those are some pretty damning numbers. Workaholism was defined in the study as \"being overly concerned about work, driven by an uncontrollable work motivation, and to investing so much time and effort to work that it impairs other important life areas,\" which, if we're being honest, sounds like most entrepreneurs in the startup world. The biggest problem with this study is that the causation of this kind of behavior continues to be a mystery. Being a workaholic was found to be both the cause and effect of psychological disorders, creating a real \"the chicken or the egg\" situation when it comes to your mental health. \"Taking work to the extreme may be a sign of deeper psychological or emotional issues,\" said Schou Andreassen, the leader researcher in the study. \"Whether this reflects overlapping genetic vulnerabilities, disorders leading to workaholism or, conversely, workaholism causing such disorders, remains uncertain.\" As studies often go, no clear solution was provided. However, one possible means of combating this attack on mental health is to stop glorifying workaholism and understanding that it is, in fact, a serious problem with startup founders, entrepreneurs, and innovators of the world. Working hard is commendable, don't get me wrong. But it does not warrant your attention at all hours of the day. Sleep, family, and free time require your attention just as much as that investor meeting you've been worried about. A solid work-life balance can breed so much more productivity than burning the midnight oil. Plus, being a workaholic is not only bad for your mental health, it's also a misnomer. After all, you're not addicted to workahol, are you? Read more about being a healthy entrepreneur here on Tech.Co Photo: Flickr / Twaalfdozijn ",

    "title": "The 4 Ways That 2017 Is Changing the Rules for Startups",
    "content": "The presidential election brought 2016 to a bumpy close and 2017 has already seen its share of related turbulence as media sources now clamber to get our attention while telling us what's important about politics and beyond. In this tumultuous environment, it can be easy to lose sight of the bigger picture from a professional standpoint, including how novel  shifts in our culture change the marketplace and what that could mean for entrepreneurs. That makes now a great time to take a step back and determine how this year, from fake news to mindless product fails has so far ushered in a variety of changes for startups that have added to the challenges faced by entrepreneurs while also increasing their opportunities for success: Digital Detoxes Are a Thing Now Now that nearly 80 percent of Americans do some form of online shopping, much emphasis is placed on ways to enhance the digital consumer experience by optimizing the technology used to present and purchase products or services. But surprisingly, the best way to connect with digital consumers may be offering better offline support. Research from RingPartner has shown the desire to have person-to-person conversations with brands is actually on the rise, with consumers now spending an average of 113 percent more time on the phone with businesses than they did in 2016. And they're not just calling. They're buying. These dialogues can ultimately lead to average conversion rates as high as 50 percent. While there is no doubt we live in a largely digitized world, the importance of humanized interactions cannot be undervalued by startups who must incorporate an opportunity to foster these personal relationships within their marketing, sales and customer service strategies. Fake News Now Gets in the Way of Real Messaging The term \"fake news\" has grown in popularity with multiple studies showing that social media platforms often allow false stories to not only be posted but also to trend. There are several different ways this information can be presented, ranging from the slanted reporting of real facts or misinterpreted data to deliberately deceptive news stories created and disseminated solely to push an agenda. It can even show up in the form of hoaxes unintentionally covered by reputable outlets. No matter how it proliferates, today's fake news ultimately hurts your startup's marketing and public relations communications as consumers are becoming less likely to trust the content they see. That means entrepreneurs must go above and beyond to ensure they're creating authentic messaging that will resonate with increasingly jaded audiences. There's a decent chance that when you read this piece's opening line about the presidential election, you immediately felt a certain way about the results. Welcome to 2017. We won't be discussing specific feelings here because the truth is that audiences have become so polarized with any issue related to politics that it's no longer in your brand's best interest to bring them up. Since the election, the marketplace has seen everything from politically-motivated boycotts to national marketing campaign disasters have a noteworthy effect on sales numbers and public perception. As a result, it's crucial that startups remain incredibly cognizant of how their product is positioned and viewed to ensure they are not alienating potential investors or customers. A slew of recent disasters based on overpromising and underdelivering has inspired some general mistrust of new tech and startups. These emotions become particularly elevated by nonstop social and traditional media coverage. The Juicero, for example, is a $400 juicing machine that has been the subject of satire and ridicule for failing to live up to its hype. Meanwhile, The Fyre Fest went from being influencer-endorsed to widely panned as a complete catastrophe in a matter of days. Certainly, it's not your startup's fault that The Fyre Fest fed dressing-less salad to people who paid $12,000 a ticket to attend a music festival. But their failure does have implications you can learn from. To avoid similar disappointment or outcry, entrepreneurs need to ensure they first focus not on being buzzworthy, but on delivering a product or service that effectively responds to consumer needs.

    "content": "Startup activity is happening in the most unlikely of places. The #StartupEverywhere series, developed by Engine, is designed to celebrate these diverse, vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystems growing across the U.S. These profiles will dive into the challenges faced by these communities and look at what sets them apart from the traditional technology hubs. Lucas Lindsey, Executive Director of Domi Station, a Tallahassee-based entrepreneurial support organization, is all about building a diverse ecosystem in his community. This time for the #StartupEverywhere series, he talks with me about breaking down barriers, investments, diversity, grassroots movements and the impact of public policies. I'm the Executive Director of Domi Education, a 501(c)(3) economic development organization with a mission focused on educating and empowering entrepreneurs. We believe entrepreneurship support is the most sustainable and cost-effective economic development strategy. Our vision is to play a central role in building the most diverse startup community in the Southeast. We empower and amplify the work of others. Today Domi is a startup incubator and coworking space, but we're always adapting to meet the needs of North Florida's evolving ecosystem. We offer programs, resources, and events that help entrepreneurs start and scale sustainable companies. Our regional network enables us to match our members to seasoned mentors, investors, and industry advisors. Read more on how your startup could get noticed by investors First, there's an unprecedented level of collaboration in Tallahassee. Organizations are partnering like never before, aligning strategic plans, co-funding shared programs, co-developing new initiatives. It's really exciting. Second, Tallahassee has an opportunity to lead on inclusion. By creating partnerships across organizations and neighborhoods, we have the chance to upend the stereotype of the South and build a startup community that breaks down barriers. Domi is well positioned as a central connector and collaborative broker. Finally, we have growing access to capital. A year and a half ago, the Florida Angel Nexus started a Tallahassee chapter, which has impacted our community. They've already invested $1.7 million across eight deals, and they're planning to launch their own fund within the next year. Tallahassee's universities are doing excellent research and have successfully commercialized a number of technologies. Additionally, they are producing quality graduates who are passionate about technology and well prepared for roles in the startup economy. There has also been a number of grassroots movements among the students to create tech-focused groups, such as (an interdisciplinary student group that focuses on teaching people to code and product development) and HackFSU (a student-organized hackathon).  Tallahassee and Leon County are a case study in progressive local policy support. Leon County kicked things off early on by partnering with Domi. They created a long-term affiliation agreement, renovated a centrally located warehouse that's now home to Domi Station, abated our rent (allowing us time to develop a track record), and they're constantly looking for opportunities to assist startups as an early client or promotional partner. The City of Tallahassee, led by Mayor Andrew Gillum, has also taken a progressive approach. They brought us a TechHire designation, have begun architecting tech workforce development programs, and launched the Tallahassee Innovation Partnership, which is a pitch series that connects startups to procurement officials in local government, state government, and higher education. We face real challenges across the board. None are insurmountable, but each one takes strategy and vision to tackle head-on. Our biggest need is a bullpen of serial entrepreneurs with industry experience and technical chops--not easy for a small city that's long relied on higher education and state government to fuel its economy.

    "title": "In Startups and Business, Women Receive Less Money [Infographic]",
    "content": "Leading up to the last U.S. election cycle, a great deal of focus was placed on wage inequality and disparities in venture capital raised by women. It is now well established that not only do women typically make less money. However, add in any other factor, and dollar-for-dollar there are decreases in wages earned or capital raised. This comes at a time when more women are launching startups than ever before, with a 68 percent increase between 1997 and 2014. By comparison, women are launching startups at two times the growth rate of men. A new study produced by Hired sheds light on these wage inequalities, while Women Who Tech compared dollars raised by women to that of their male counterparts. Between both studies, some cause and effect can be drawn between the two. As constraints are made, women are creating opportunities for themselves in building new businesses, only to be challenged again with an underfunded environment. According to Women Who Tech, only seven percent of outside funding currently go to women-led startups. For some contrast, the same report shows that for every six investments made towards an all-male startup, one is provided for an all-woman led startup. As seen in the infographic, it can also been noted that for the women-led startups who receive funding, there is a 35 percent higher return on investment and generate 12 percent higher revenue. On wage gaps, Hired found that 63 percent of the time women received lower salary offers than men for the same job at the same company. Though negative, Hired also reported that this is an improvement when compared to last year's report. Much of the wage disparities start in the negotiation and interview stages, with a staggering 69 percent that asked for less money than men. By comparison, only six percent ask for the same amount as men, and 25 percent asked for more (typically younger women).  Disparities only stretch further when you add in other factors such as an LGBTQ status. According to Hired, white men are offered the highest salaries and black women are offered the lowest salaries. Non-LGBTQ men out earn all other categories, followed by LGBTQ men, non-LGBTQ women, and LGBTQ women.

    "title": "Security Needs to Be the DNA of Any Fintech Startup",
    "content": "Launching a fintech startup in a regulated industry is going to take a proactive approach. Surrounding yourself with mentors and experts in the field to guide you through the hills and valleys will be the key to success in fintech. Columbus Startup Week powered by Chase for Business hosted a panel to discuss the future of fintech. Panelists included Kevin Pohmer, former CEO and chairman of Financial Guard and founder of FinTech 71, and Jason Strle, CIO of Chase Consumer and Business Banking. Mike Nemeth, CEO of S3 Planning and lead organizer of this year's Columbus Startup Week, moderated the discussion. Pohmer, who led Financial Guard, the premier \"fixed fee\" online investment advisor that was acquired by Legg Mason in 2016, said that if you're going to create a product in a regulated industry you need to do your research and really know what you're getting into or you could lose your shirt. \"We spend time early on understanding the regulatory compliance environment before trying to acquire customers and launch our startup,\" Pohmer said. \"You are dealing with people's money, retirement, and personal management solutions-and [if you get it wrong] it can cost your brand, business and determine success in the long run.\" Customers need to trust that when they use financial services their personal and financial information is secure, period. Strle couldn't stress enough to founders the importance of having a security-first mindset when building their product. \"You want to think about how to detect fraud and protect people's private information, it's unbelievably important. You need to know what you're getting into,\" Strle said. \"Focus on having the same mentality, culture and mindset to protect the customer at all costs.\" Pohmer took the 'try to break it' approach with Financial Guard and brought in outside people to purposely attempt to hack the system to expose any holes. \"With compliance and security, don't think you can do that internally. Bring in people to try to break your system. Our mindset was 'let's try to break this thing before we start working with the big boys'. There is a high sensitivity to security and the worst thing for a small company to have is a breach,\" Pohmer said. Interview: Adam Lyons of The Zebra on being scrappy, Mark Cuban and mentorship  The known startup mentality is to disrupt an industry, do something that has never been done before, or shaking up the way things have always been done. For fintech founders, Pohmer suggests shifting to a \"transformative mindset\" where their technology could help larger institutions solve problems for their customers. Pohmer pivoted his product to a B2B solution that allowed large corporations to bolt it onto their current services. \"We started out as a B2C product and we could have succeeded, but we asked ourselves if we want to be competing with the big financial services year after year.\" Pohmer said. \"To transform an industry is just as cool as disrupting an industry.\" Whichever mindset you choose, it's important to stick to the core mission of your product. \"Be true to your technology. If it differentiates, this is the value that you bring,\" Strle said. \"Lots of times the problems aren't exotic, but the technology solves a problem. There are tech companies who have learned along the way that creative solutions and a great story can be [attractive] to a buyer of the product.\" Having a diverse and inclusive team has shown to not only improve the bottom line but enhance the quality of a product. And when fintech founders are building a solution, having those perspectives can be attractive to larger businesses. \"A company that works for us that has an inclusive team will win every time,\" Strle said. \"Their products, ideas, the way they approach products will win in the long run. You've got to make that a priority to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce, it's critical to success and a lot of the companies who don't' get that won't be a company for very long.\" With more consumers conducting business on-the-go, the need for mobile solutions is at the forefront of financial institutions, and with it comes the need for more security. \"The customer is asking for convenience, and mobile-first is our motto,\" Strle said. \"[We ask companies] how they enable that solution on a mobile device [as well as] its physical presence and location. [However,] with that ease of use comes with it a litany of fraud challenges and how a customer will use these solutions without experiencing fraud. Thus, the cybersecurity concern grows with it.\" Read more about fintech startups at Tech.Co This article is part of a Startup Week content series brought to you by CHASE for BUSINESS.

    "title": "Former Startup of the Year Contestants on Why You Need to Apply Today",
    "content": "Every year, Tech.Co holds the Startup of the Year competition, a pitch contest that pits a huge number of startups against each other in pursuit of capital, business resources, and bragging rights in the startup community. The competition takes place at our annual conference, Innovate! and Celebrate, in San Francisco in October. And to say that startups leave happy would be more than an understatement. We reached out to a number of former Startup of the Year contestants in hopes of spurring a discussion about the value of the competition. We were so overwhelmed by the support and praise from these startup founders and entrepreneurs that we felt it necessary to share their insights with our readers. If you're thinking about applying, now is the time to do it! The Startup of the Year competition isn't about rewarding the companies you've seen a thousand times in pitch competitions. Tech.Co is committed to inclusivity across all facets of startup life, and our contestants feel that commitment at our events. \"The organizing team and staff were accommodating for Grok and the other companies, making sure everyone had their needs met during the event,\" said Tarun Gangwani, Head of Product at Grok. \"Our team was given many chances to network with experienced entrepreneurs and executives across multiple industries. Tech.Co ensured the event would be worth while, even if we didn't end up going on to win the competition itself.\" This competition isn't meant to be an intimidating experience. The Startup of the Year competition is designed to make entrepreneurs, founders, and innovators feel welcomed by a community of peers that are all trying to do the same thing: make the world a better place. \"The Tech.Co staff made us feel extremely welcomed,\" said Courtney Caldwell, cofounder of ShearShare. They cared less about a team's technical expertise or background and were much more focused on whether or not a company's mission and model introduces new and innovative ideas that are outside of the standard prescription and ShearShare certainly fit that bill.\" The goal of any startup competition should be to inspire the attendees, support the startups, and facilitate networking in as many ways as possible. Fortunately, given the size of our event, we think we accomplish that in spades. \"There is a ton of work that goes into putting these events on and the team at Tech.Co always makes it seem like its easy going for all involved,\" said James Ross, Cofounder of Hedgechatter. \"They keep the group size to a manageable level, which is important because it only takes attending one of those super massive 1000+ exhibitor events to feel like your startup is just another speck of sand on the beach. The Startup of the Year competition on the other hand was sized right which allowed startups, entrepreneurs, investors, and attendees to really learn about products/services and have quality meetings with potential investors and customers.\" Of course, the goal of a competition is to win. However, winning isn't the only thing, as Tech.Co provides a wide range of benefits for contestants, from networking opportunities and business resources to exposure and media attention. \"The opportunity to network with founders from Silicon Valley is really unparalleled,\" said Garrett Moon, CEO and cofounder of CoSchedule. \"There was tons of energy and excitement during the entire event and working with other founders spurred a wealth of ideation and momentum beyond.\" In addition to all the benefits of the event, taking part in the Startup of the Year competition provides unique opportunities outside of Tech.Co, which can lead to success in a number of different ways. \"The accolades and recognition were wonderful and very uplifting to the team, but the very best thing was the booth we received at CES in January,\" said Paul Droege, founder and CEO of SunPort. \"The fact it was free was nice but it had an amazing, high-traffic location which was awesome. We leveraged the location into great visibility, made some great connections and learned a great deal by interacting with people during CES, all of which came from our Tech.Co win.\" Winning any startup competition is going to do wonders for your progress. Just ask Stephanie Lampkin, the founder and CEO of Blendoor, whose company won the competition in 2015. \"Winning startup of the year provided a lot of validation that what we're building is valuable which helped us get into a top 5 accelerator,\" said Stephanie Lampkin, founder and CEO of Blendoor. \"It also connected us with big tech companies who are now on our beta.\" On the other hand, winning the Startup of the Year competition is not the only way to enjoy success. For example, 2015 finalist TurboAppeal was just acquired by Paradigm Tax Group in a move that can only be deemed successful. \"It helped give us confidence in the validation behind our product as well as understand the reaction from the VC community as well as potential customers,\" said Badal Shah, CEO of TurboAppeal. \"We are grateful for the opportunity with Tech.Co.\" If you think you have what it takes to be the Startup of the Year, you need to apply today. Remember, the 100 startups that are chosen will be invited to join us in San Francisco, CA for Innovate! and Celebrate 2017, and will be on their way to startup success in no time!

    "title": "Chicago Startup TurboAppeal Acquired by Paradigm Tax Group",
    "content": "In 2015, TurboAppeal, a Chicago-based, leading technology firm that utilizes big data analytics and proprietary software solutions to help both commercial and residential real estate owners gain insight into their property values and automate the tax appeal process, was one of the five finalists in our Startup of the Year competition. We've been following their progress and growth and since then: they've raised $5.7M in capital, totaling $7.2M, to be used for multi-city expansion. Back in the August 2016, TurboAppeal launched their a new commercial tax appeal product through a partnership with Paradigm Tax Group, a national property tax consulting firm that serves all 50 states. Today, they have acquired TurboAppeal to solidify that they are the only technology-enabled property tax service and product solution for owners of both commercial and residential real estate to date. Together they are looking to combine TurboAppeal's technology and Paradigm's ASCEND system and transform the way property taxes are managed. Baal Shah, cofounder and CEO of TurboAppeal, now Chief Marketing Officer of Paradigm Tax Group said he believed approximately 70 percent of homes are over paying on their property taxes and wanted to provide a solution for homeowners. With this acquisition, the homeowner can sign up in less than 30 seconds. Then their algorithm works through the data to generate the most accurate evidence for the homeowner. As of Fall 2016, TurboAppeal saved property owners close to $10MM in property taxes. \"We are ecstatic about the opportunity to join Paradigm Tax Group,\" said Badal Shah, co-founder and CEO of TurboAppeal and now Chief Marketing Officer of Paradigm Tax Group. \"We have always recognized Paradigm as the most forward thinking national property tax firm with the strongest value proposition in the market, and believe TurboAppeal's capabilities will further strengthen Paradigm's position.\" Read more about the Chicago startup ecosystem here at Tech.Co Frank Gruber, founder of TechCo Media, Inc is an advisor to TurboAppeal.

    "title": "7 Startups in Venture Hall's Inaugural Accelerator Cohort",
    "content": "A pain-management app, an AI-enabled medical records software company, and a cloud-based wellness tracking platform for employers are among Venture Hall's first cohort of healthcare-related startups that will spend three months in Portland this summer scaling their businesses and expanding their networks. Venture Hall, which launched last July with the mission of offering Portland a year-round hub for innovation, revealed the names of its inaugural startup accelerator cohort on Friday. The cohort consists of seven early-stage companies. Two are from Maine, two from California, and one each from Colorado, Missouri, and Texas. Four of the companies have female founders, and two are graduates of previous accelerator programs in other parts of the country. Venture Hall received 83 applications from startups located in 23 states and seven countries, according to Jess Knox, Venture Hall's president and cofounder. To be considered, companies had to have a working prototype and have a product or service that would support healthcare workers, their well-being, efficacy, engagement, and resilience. \"We're incredibly excited to bring these teams to Maine to be a part of our accelerator program this summer,\" Knox said. \"Each of these companies provide a real opportunity to explore different ways of supporting the resilience of frontline caregivers. We're excited to get them here and start working with them. The healthcare bent is a result of a partnership Venture Hall announced in February with MaineHealth, the owner of Maine Medical Center, and Unum, the major insurance provider. Besides offering financial support (each company contributed $100,000), MaineHealth and Unum have each pledged to take an active role in the accelerator, providing mentors, business resources, and subject matter expertise to the startups accepted into the accelerator. Representatives from each company were also involved in the acceptance process. Indeed, Mike Sobol, Venture Hall's CEO and other cofounder, said Unum and MaineHealth's involvement drove interest in the accelerator from founders looking to not only take advantage of potential mentorship opportunities, but to develop business relationships and channel partnerships with the companies and their affiliates. \"The opportunity to work with MaineHealth and Unum yielded companies with a very serious pedigree,\" Sobol said. The founders accepted into the cohort will arrive in Portland in early June for three months of learning, networking, and scaling their companies. The founders will work out of Cloudport Co-working Multispace, where Venture Hall is located. Venture Hall has developed its accelerator program in partnership with Village Capital, a Washington D.C.-based venture capital firm that supports startup accelerator programs around the world. Unlike some accelerator programs, Venture Hall doesn't require a slice of equity in the startups it accepts into the cohort. The accelerator will be capped with that Demo Day on Sept. 8, which will be attended by active angel and venture capital investors. Venture Hall's inaugural cohort of startups consists of these seven startups: This Texas-based company has developed a wellness-provider marketplace and dashboard for employers. Its platform is running in several cities with paying users, including Paypal and Black & Decker. Based in California, Livzo has developed a wellness support and tracking platform for employers. Its platform is in beta-testing with nurses and other wellness providers. This California-based startup has developed a pain management app based on mindfulness exercises. Ella is a Techstars Los Angeles Accelerator '16 grad and has conducted initial product testing at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. Based in Colorado, Cliexa has developed chronic condition management apps. It's a graduate of the\nBoulder, Colo.-based Boomtown Accelerator and has developed its product in partnership with Kaiser Permanente. This Missouri-based company has developed a platform for choosing and enrolling in post-acute care. It currently has 12 paying hospital clients. Based in Maine, SpinDocs is a medical records software company that integrates artificial intelligence with electronic medical records systems. Its first pilot is currently underway with a medical practice in Massachusetts. This Maine-based startup has developed sensor-enabled medical needle systems. It's in the prototype-testing phase and working on FDA approval and business model strategy. The post Venture Hall names its inaugural accelerator cohort appeared first on Maine Startups Insider.

    "title": "Is Your Startup Really a Small Business in Disguise?",
    "content": "As the digital economy progresses, the lines between startups and successful small businesses are starting to blur. To be sure, you wouldn't confuse a law firm in Kansas City with a venture-funded Silicon Valley software startup of the same size. But neither one of those is as typical these days as they used to be. Quick, can you tell if this is a small business or a startup? You can't tell the difference, based on this information. As more small businesses go digital and innovate, they look similar to the majority of software (SaaS) startups that are self-funded and surviving with \"Lean Startup\" habits. Both are hard. Both have risks. Both can start small and grow big. Both can go out of business. Both have ambitious and talented leaders who want to be their own bosses. The real difference is the intent to grow big or stay small. Startups have higher ambition to create big businesses and get there faster. Invest now for a big payoff later. Go big or die. Change the world. Small businesses don't have the same visions and aren't placing their bets in the same way. They don't risk as much. They don't go too fast. Most stay small, but some grow into big businesses. The difference is a decision by the founders on how to play the growth game. And it can change. Some small businesses discover opportunities and redefine themselves as ambitious startups. Most startups fail to grow fast enough, so they simply turned into sustainable businesses that are not big, not growing fast and not going out of business. The exceptional startups are the few (usually venture-funded) growers that get most of the attention. When your vision changes about how much you will risk to go big, it's time to retool your strategies, your tactics and your team. Entrepreneurs should be very careful about what kind of business they decide they are in at any given time, and remember the following: 1)  Your investors will change. Venture capital (VC) investors will only fund companies with real potential to grow to $50 million and higher within five to seven years. If you're growing slower than that, profitable private equity investors or angel investors are a better fit. If you're not growing and not profitable, you'll have to make some tough decisions to get back to breakeven quickly. 2) Your investment approach will change. If you're scaling back, you just can't make as many of those costly investments that might pay off bigger in the future. When you're scaling up, you need to look further ahead and make sure you are solving for where your company will be in a year or two. Many companies stop growing because they didn't create foundations to support a larger and more complex company. 3) The CEO needs to change their approach. The mentality and habits of the CEO drives the culture of a small company. If goals are reduced but the CEO is still pushing hard for big growth, employee frustration will grow fast. On the other hand, if the pace picks up and the CEO is still in a mindset of last year's business, they need to get help and catch up quickly. Small businesses and startups are both great adventures that do great things. Just be clear which game you are playing at any time and make the most of your business. ",

    "title": "43North Competition Offers Mentorship, Funding, and No State Taxes",
    "content": "Startup competitions come in all shapes and sizes. Some offer capital that will help founders acquire the resources they need to keep their company moving forward. Others offer mentorship, which is more valuable than anything for startup founders that are new to the entrepreneurial landscape. But there's one startup competition that, in addition to all those prizes, offers a chance to avoid paying state taxes for an entire decade. 43North is an annual startup competition offering $5 million to truly remarkable startups around the world. They've crowned 29 winning startups from across North America and as far away as Taiwan and Israel. In addition to the sizable amount of capital, 43North provides winning startups with incubator space and expert mentorship to help grow their company. The goal of the competition is to foster the economy of the Buffalo area, which is made apparent by the necessity for company founders, along with at least half the staff to move to the area for at least a year. \"More than half of the new jobs that are coming into the United States are coming from entrepreneurs creating new businesses,\" said Peter Burakowski, director of marketing at 43North. \"So you're also seeing millennials want to be involved in starting companies, or are already starting companies. So when we think about today, and what's healthy for Buffalo, and for the next decade and beyond, we really need to be fostering this culture of entrepreneurship.\"  In addition to the plentiful resources being made available through the competition, 43North also allows the winning startups to apply to START-UP NY, which allows New York-based companies to operate without paying state taxes for ten years on or near eligible university or college campuses in the state of New York. Not a bad perk for a startup competition. \"We're honing in more on fit,\" Burakowski said. \"If you're a startup that's really ready to grow, what do we have here in Buffalo that we can provide?\" If you're interested in applying to the competition, you can head to their website and register here. Applications for the 2017 application period are being accepted until May 24. Make sure to read the terms and conditions before applying. Read more about startup competitions here on Tech.Co ",

    "title": "How NYC Is Turning the Value of Its Premium Brand into Digital Gold",
    "content": "I want you to travel back in time with me twenty years or so.  The Internet is young and still relatively unknown to most of us.  Only a small group of web enthusiasts understand how to navigate it -- let alone make a buck on it.  At this time, a handful of savvy prospectors have begun to take notice of the commercial potential behind this remarkable new technology.  Silently, they begin buying up domain names, also known as virtual real estate, that will soon dwarf the appreciation potential of any real estate investment in physical world.   In a few short years, their early investments will pay off in a way that few could have ever imagined, as businesses around the world scramble for a presence in the greatest marketplace the world has ever seen.  Fast-forward to a few years later and take a look at some of the eye-popping numbers that buyers have paid to acquire some top .com domains: In fact, over the past two decades over a billion dollars of premium domain name deals have been reported and documented - with potentially billions more in stealth, under-the-radar sales that have gone unreported.  If someone had told you, back in the mid-nineties, that a simple \"domain name\" could fetch these outrageous prices, you would probably not have believed it.  Yet as incredible as these prices seem to the average person, to a business looking to be found amidst the clutter and confusion of today's Internet - a short, meaningful, memorable domain name is well worth the premium price tag. It has often been said that \"domain names are the real estate of the Internet.\" Just like physical real estate in the offline world, virtual real estate has a value that is directly related to variables like supply, demand and location.  After-all, a well-placed domain name can help businesses and brands to better connect and engage with consumers, garner coveted internet traffic -- and stand out from the competition. Until recently, .com was really the only game in town, and the scarcity of premium .com domains helped to justify the multi-million dollar price tags.  But the internet has come a long way in the last two decades - and thanks to a recent change in internet governance approved by ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) - today there are over a thousand new dot anythings and dot everythings available for individuals, investors, businesses and brands to choose from.   In what has come to be known as the \"not-com\" revolution, over the past three years, close to 28 million domain names have been registered across 1200 \"new\" top-level domain extensions - including hobbies (e.g., .yoga, .baseball), professions (e.g., .law, .health), distinctions (.guru, .ninja) and cities (paris, .melbourne, .nyc) - among other things.   More new top-level domains mean more options for individuals, businesses and brands to choose from - and less perceived scarcity. While the premium values of \"new\" domains have yet to come close to the stratospheric prices of .com domains during their heyday, make no mistake about it -- there is value to be found if you know where to look. Unfortunately, you can't turn the clock back two decades to take advantage of the .com boom.  But the good news is that the internet is still just a baby.  If you pay close enough attention, there are still many opportunities to leverage today's new domains to find and create value - and to build meaningful brands. For example, here are just a few sales that demonstrate the premium values buyers have placed on certain new top-level domains names in the past couple of years. Perched atop the most prime piece of physical real estate in the world, New York City is arguably the world's most iconic city.  \"The Big Apple.\" \"The Capital of the World.\" \"The Center of the Universe.\" \"The City that Never Sleeps.\" Thanks in part to the strength and power of New York City's brand, NYC is now well on the way toward creating one of the most valuable digital domains on the Internet.   As part of its commitment to take the lead in digital innovation, 3 years ago, the City of New York launched the .nyc (pronounced dot-nyc) top-level domain, creating an official web address exclusively for the use of the people, businesses and brands of New York City.  Competing with legacy domains like .com, .net and .org, the .nyc domain gives New Yorkers the ability to connect and transact business through a shared location, and to showcase their affiliation with NYC as an enviable component of their success.  In addition to serving as a powerful city branding and public diplomacy tool, the .nyc domain provides individuals and businesses a branded space for expression and development -- and a sense of community that unites New Yorkers as a force in the global internet. According to namestat.org, .nyc has become the largest domain extension of any city in the world - beating out other major global cities for the distinction, including .London, .Berlin, .Tokyo, and .Paris, to name just a few.  While most .nyc domain names sell for a retail price of +/-$25-$35, domain buyers have demonstrated that certain .nyc domain names have more intrinsic value than others.  In a series of open and transparent domain auctions, here are some of the premium values that New Yorkers have placed on select .nyc domain names during the past few years. Domain names like these are considered premium for a variety of reasons, including factors like popularity in search, social trends, keyword value, brandability and category definition.  Premium domain names can help to drive consumer engagement, media attention, search engine traffic and sales - that's why they are so valuable. Right now, some of the highest value premium domains available in the .nyc namespace are up for auction. The auction, celebrating \"Tech in the City,\" is showcasing 26 of the most meaningful, memorable tech category names like, apps.nyc, startup.nyc, gaming.nyc, UX.nyc and more.  The auction also features names like VC.nyc and Angel.nyc, for the benefit of the investors who have helped to fuel the City's tech growth. The .nyc tech domain auction is taking place online from now through May 18th, 2017.  You can get all the details at www.auctions.nyc.  As New York City's digital landscape continues to evolve, the ones to benefit are those first to the game. If you want a chance to own a part of NYC digital history, be sure to check out the full list of premium domains below and get your bids in before May 18th at http://www.auctions.nyc. Bidding starts at just $500 to ensure that this opportunity is accessible to all residents, students, entrepreneurs, and businesses.   Just remember, .nyc is an exclusive benefit for New Yorkers - so only individuals and businesses in the five boroughs are eligible to participate. And hurry, or your chance to own one of these premium .nyc tech domains will be gone in a New York minute!

    "title": "4 Lottery Apps to Check if You're a Big Winner",
    "content": "Lotteries provide a fun entertainment for millions and a new lifestyle for a (very) tiny handful. And now that there's an app for everything, you can even download the experience. But does the official app do the trick? LotteryHUB calls itself \"an Official App of Mega Millions and Powerball National Lotteries,\" but the reviews aren't exactly stellar:  Ranking high in an app store is no guarantee that an app is high quality. If you need an app to scan your ticket all by itself, look no further than your state's lottery app -- search your state in iTunes or the Google Play store to turn up every app from California to Illinois. And if you're still looking, here's a rundown on the best lottery apps available now.  This app offers quick, easy access to the results for every big lottery: Mega Millions, Powerball and U.S. state lottery results across a wide variety of states. You'll learn the latest jackpot, winning numbers with drawing history, prize levels and payouts, and even the game information for multi-state Mega Millions, Powerball, Hot Lotto, 2by2, Lucky for Life, Cash 4 Life, and state lotto games.  The less confident lottery ticket enthusiast can let this app crunch the numbers for them: It will choose the numbers for your weekly ticket pick using a spinning numbers wheel, and lets you save each choice.  Look no further: This app can scan your tickets for the biggest lotteries around: Powerball and Mega Millions. At the time of writing, it's been updated just last month, so it should be able to get the job done, helping you save time while still getting your ticket cashed.  For the data-lovers, this app will turn up the most popular winning patterns. That's certainly no indicator that they'll win again, but there's no reason not to go with a number that's proven it has been a winner in the past. After all, your odds of winning the lottery might be low, but the odds of getting to fantasize about what you would do with your newfound millions are 100 percent.

    "title": "Funding for startups compared: crowdfund vs VC vs bank vs bootstrap vs angels",
    "content": "Any startup will tell you that cash flow is absolutely crucial to the survival of their business. Two-thirds of startups have less than a year's worth of money left, according to Anand Sawal of investment analysts CB Insights. Some startups are lucky enough to be profitable from year one, either thanks to income from clients or channelling their own funds into the business. However many have to seek external funding. There are a vast range of options facing founders today. You can go to an angel investor, a venture capitalist, bootstrap the business with your own money, crowdfund, ask for a bank loan, enter an accelerator or incubator programme, partner with a bigger firm, or even run a new-fangled blockchain 'token exchange campaign'. Unfortunately \"this is the decision most founders get wrong, often hindering or causing irreparable damage to the startup's longer term prospects\", warns Ofri Ben Porat, cofounder of Pixoneye. As a rule, your best bet when building a funding strategy is to \"focus on the type and scale of the problem your product is aiming to solve, and then consider how and when specific investors can help you achieve those goals\", advises Damian Kimmelman, cofounder of DueDil. We've spoken to a range of founders and investors on the pros and cons of these various routes. Here is what they had to say. Bootstrapping means funding a company using personal finances or its operating revenues. Some founders swear by it, like Colette Ballou, who set up Ballou PR. She tells Techworld: \"Bootstrap if you can. I always have.\" What are the advantages of this route? Put simply, it keeps you in full control of your company and spending. \"The main benefit of starting and growing the business from personal investment is that we don't have to justify any spend to a board or worry about outstanding debts,\" says Jake Madders, cofounder of Hyve Managed Hosting. However there are downsides. The main issue is that there are big restrictions on growth. Basically, a 'bootstrapped' startup can't grow more quickly than their credit permits, whereas external funding lets you to grow as quickly as you need or want to. It also means that, as money for hiring is tight, founders have to take on the vast majority of the legwork. \"It has meant a lot of long hours. It has required a lot of work on the part of Jon and I [the cofounder],\" Madders admits. But even this he says, has allowed him to have \"such a personal pride in seeing the success of the company, having been involved in every step of the journey\". There is a lot to be said for choosing to go to an angel investor, especially an individual within your specific sector that you have a good existing relationship with. It is a popular route for early-stage startups that need a bit of extra money to help get them off the ground. \"One of the best ideas is to get angel investors who are a few stages ahead of you in their business journey. Angels who have already made massive successes might be too removed from the problem you are trying to solve,\" Kimmelman says. Angel investors will choose to invest in your startup because they share your vision and excitement, and have faith in your team and the viability of your idea, Porat says. They will be committed, basically, and they will be able to be a supportive, realistic mentor of your business. Where are the disadvantages? You will have to cede some control over your business, at least slightly. The angel investor will expect a cash return or equity in the business (they aren't charities). Angel investment may also be less appropriate if you are a later-stage startup or need access to large sums. Venture capitalists get a lot of attention in the tech press yet they are inappropriate for the vast majority of startups. So it's really important to think through whether it's the right route for you before you plough time and effort into trying to get VC funding. One of the biggest advantages of VCs is they have access to vast sums of money, so it's a good option if you need to expand at a rate beyond that available via angel investors or bank loans. They also have great connections and experience, so will be able to help make introductions and give advice, as well as support on tax, law and personnel. However, tread very carefully. You will have to cede even more control over your business than with angel investors. VCs will take a sizeable stake in your business and will expect a say over its future direction. It also sets a clock ticking to the sale of your company, when VCs expect to 'exit' with a sizeable return. \"Don't rush towards VC funding. If you're in the early stages particularly,\" Porat warns. It is absolutely crucial to bear in mind that \"angels manage their own money, while VCs manage other people's funds,\" he says. Many startups are naturally wary of partnering with a big corporate. They are very different beasts culturally, financially and in many other ways, so caution is warranted. However, it isn't a route to jettison automatically.  \"As long as the founders retain control over the daily business operations and enough freedom, the 'corp-up' approach provides a number of benefits that a VC could never replicate,\" says Boris Bogaert, cofounder of Xpenditure. In particular, these benefits include access to the resources, customers and products of a multinational company and a trusted 'brand' from day one, he says. Corporate venture capital, where startups take money from a big corporate's fund, is also an option. For example fintech startups have received investment from CVCs like Santander 'InnoVentures', Citigroup's 'Citi Ventures' and Goldman Sachs, says Ali Ramadan, VC specialist at law firm Bird & Bird. These corporates can help with expertise, navigating regulations, plus supplier and customer networks, he adds. However, there are massive risks, as referred to earlier. Partnering with a corporate can be playing with fire, and startups should be aware of their relative size and strength. The same issues around loss of control crop up, but to compound that there is also the fear that a corporate could steal your intellectual property, try and buy your startup (though this could be desirable!), overload you with bureaucracy or force you to lose flexibility or identity, for example adopting their branding. You also need to have a lot of trust in that corporate. If you're putting all your eggs in one basket, you'd better ensure it's a reliable one. Although not always the first route startups consider, there are plenty of upsides to running a crowdfunding campaign. It's a popular route for B2C startups in particular. \"Crowdfunding platforms can offer young businesses the opportunity to not only raise funds but also test the concepts of their new idea directly with interested consumers, helping them develop their products in the meantime,\" Ramadan says. The advantage of crowdfunding is it combines raising money with a marketing campaign, says Joel Hughes, UK head of technology and hardware at Indiegogo. This worked well for Monzo bank for example, which raised PS2.5 million in under 24 hours.  \"Now the regulations have been put in place to allow equity crowdfunding, anyone can invest in the companies they believe in. This helps the business get help from a broader pool of investors and, in exchange, these investors benefit financially if the company is successful, and more than ever can feel like part of the team,\" he adds. However there is one obvious, big risk: you (very publicly) fail to raise enough money. This can lead to both financial and reputation damage, and can mean you walk away empty handed. There is also the fear that others may copy your idea, and it can be a very time-consuming way to raise cash. Here's a new one on us: a token exchange campaign (TEC), also referred to as 'initial coin offerings'. Some VCs have suggested this could be the future of investment, such as Jamie Burke, CEO of Outlier Ventures & Convergence VC. One company called Blockpool is running a 'TEC' campaign right now. They are making 25 million 'coins' available in exchange for either cryptocurrency or currency, with all the transactions stored on a distributed ledger, ensuring a fair and equal percentage split across all contributions. The benefits, according to Blockpool's cofounder David Blundell, are that TECs are open to all investors, allow startups to dictate their own terms, have lower fees than the alternatives, lead to more community interaction and keep control with the startup founders to crowdfund as they choose. It also lets them accept any currencies, thus widening the potential pool of investors.   However there are downsides. Although some VCs are hailing them as the future, some investors can be wary about putting their money into TECs as there are still questions over how they are regulated. They also have no say over how the money they provide gets spent, as they don't get a stake in the business. ",

    "title": "Foreign tech talent pool has already shrunk by 50 percent in the UK post-Brexit, according to Hired report",
    "content": "A report by the technology recruitment platform Hired.com shows that the tech workers and employers in the UK are already seeing the effect of Brexit, with the number of foreign tech workers in the UK already down 50 percent. Mehul Patel, CEO at Hired told Techworld that he was surprised with \"just how quickly both demand for foreign workers and their interest in working here changed\". \"So you have both sides feeling like it is uncertain what it is going to be like to be a foreign worker here or to hire someone and they are throttling their activity as a result.\"  As well as the 50 percent drop in foreign workers in the candidate pool on the platform since the decision to leave the European Union, the rate at which foreign tech workers are accepting UK-based roles has also decreased by nearly 20 percent. Leave voters may be heartened to see the percentage of British companies sending offers to candidates outside the country fell from 25 percent at the beginning of 2016 to just 18 percent a year later. The report also showed that the number of individuals accepting initial job offers from companies in the UK was down nearly 20 percent for foreign workers, whereas the acceptance rate was flat for local candidates. The total sample size for the report was from 20,000 interview requests and job offers over the past year through Hired's total UK marketplace of 850 companies and more than 100,000 job seekers. This report comes at a time when the UK government has called a snap general election in the run-up to the hard task of negotiating an exit from the EU.  Anxiety about Brexit in the tech sector has been high since the referendum results came out, and the Hired survey of more than 200 UK-based tech workers exemplifies this. When asked what they were most worried about, the \"impact of Brexit\" was top with 55 percent of respondents, followed by happiness at work, personal development, economic uncertainty and salary. With salaries already lower in the UK than other major tech cities across the USA and Australia, according to Hired, Patel sees Brexit as the potential tipping point when it comes to a highly-skilled tech worker deciding where they want to start a career. Rival cities are already circling the UK's tech talent and businesses too. Just this week experts have predicted that the newly elected French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron will look to poach talent to a more centrist France. Berlin deployed buses in the aftermath of the vote to urge UK startups to move to the German city. The report showed that a startling 70 percent of UK tech workers have already considered leaving the UK, but Hired was unable to break that number out according to their nationality.  Patel qualified the findings by saying that the report is just a \"pulse\" for the UK jobs market post-Brexit and that the current period of uncertainty \"might be the worst part of the curve\". \"Once there is a better sense of what Brexit looks like, and if there is a hard Brexit which is looking likely, and what the immigration rules are going to look like, once people have a sense of that, you might see them get back to a new normal, but it will be a new normal, it won't be the old normal,\" he said.

    "title": "Who are the hottest robotics startups in the UK? Meet 14 of the country's best",
    "content": "Reading-based startup Generic Robots works on technology that lets users create, feel, manipulate or alter simulated 3D objects in a virtual environment. The team is building the world's first general purpose simulated training platform for dentists and doctors with this tech. The SimuTouch system is designed to provide a safe and versatile way to learn complex clinical procedures. They've also designed a platform to bring the technology to the masses, with potential applications for haptic VR in fields from gaming to education. The company has been developing its technology for more than ten years, and its dental training simulator is already in use at Kings College London. It recently raised PS251,746 from the SyndicateRoom investment platform. Minimally invasive surgery tends to be a highly expensive procedure, but Cambridge Medical Robotics is developing a next-generation robotic system that could make it affordable and universally accessible. The startup has already successfully tested the performance of the platform on cadavers. The big plans have already attracted big backing. In July 2016, the company raised $20.3 million in a Series A funding round from investors including ABB Technology Ventures, LGT Global Invest and Cambridge Innovation Capital. London-based startup Automata was founded in January 2015 to democratise robotics by lowering costs and improving usability. The company plans to use a robotics-as-a-service (RAAS) business model to integrate robotics into existing workflows more efficiently and to bring automation to new markets. Automata has attracted an undisclosed quantity of funding from ABB Technology Ventures (ATV). Founders Mostafa El Sayed and Suryansh Chandra previously worked as lead designers at Zaha Hadid Architecture, and their first product should be a welcome one in their former profession. The low-cost, plug and play, table-top robotic arm called Eva is ideally suited for design studios, but has been developed to also work in SMEs from a myriad of other industries. University of Sheffield spin-out Consequential Robotics was established to develop companion and assistive robotic systems to enhance quality of life as people age. The first product developed by the startup is a mechanical pet with dog-like features called MiRO that is said to be \"the first robot that thinks like an animal\". MiRo is controlled by technology modelled on the biological brain, and a limited number are currently available to professional researchers for PS1,900 plus tax and shipping. Iconic British designer Sebastian Conran teamed up with the university's Professor Tony Prescott and Dr Ben Mitchinson to found the company in 2016. The research was supported by Innovate UK and it's received funding as part of an EU project. Ai Build wants to develop robotic technologies to support 3D printing in the built environment. The London startup was born in November 2015 and attracted PS75,000 of seed funding from Seedcamp the next year. Founder Daghan Cam envisions a future of construction in which industrial robotics and machine learning automate fabrication processes and help make large-scale 3D printing affordable. Last October the company unveiled the Daedalus Pavilion to showcase the technology's potential. The 5m high and 4.5m wide structure was built using a customised KUKA robotic arm and a 3D printing gun. Bristol-based Reach Robotics is developing monster robots controlled by mobile devices to use with video games. The company has created more than thirty prototypes since it was launched in 2014, but the first design to be released commercially is MekaMon.  The customisable machines are designed to let players engage in combat through augmented reality gaming and are currently available from $275 (PS224).  Reach Robotics has secured a disclosed total of $250,000 (PS200,575) in seed funding so far from seven different investors. Open Bionics designs 3D-printed bionic hands for amputees using medical grade materials. The open source initiative produces devices that are easily reproduced using off-the-shelf materials and teamed up with Disney in 2015 to create a superhero-themed range of prosthetics for children.  The company has received a total of $120,000 (PS96,270) equity funding and $20,000 (PS16,045) seed funding. In February it added $1 million (PS802,100) in prize money after beating more than 1,000 other entrants to the International UAE Robotics for Good Award. The winnings will be used to push the product through the final stages of medical testing before it can be made available to everyone who needs it. Oxfordshire startup Animal Dynamics emerged as a spinout company from the Department of Zoology at Oxford University that builds bio-inspired vehicles using deep science to understand naturally-evolved designs. The team are working to develop a portfolio of products based on research into flight, swimming and walking in the natural world. The company was co-founded by biomechanics professor Dr Adrian Thomas and entrepreneur Alex Caccia in 2015, and has attracted seed funding from angel investors Oxford Technology and the University of Oxford Isis Fund (UOIF) to build and test its first products and an undisclosed amount of Series A funding. The creators of Moley Robotics claim to have designed the world's first robotic kitchen. The automated chef is operated by a smartphone and combines the standard kitchen equipment of oven, hob and sink with the unusual addition of two dexterous robotic arms that take care of the cooking. The company has raised a total of $1.17 million (PS939,000) in equity crowdfunding since it was founded in 2014. A prototype of the device won the \"Best of the Best\" award at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Shanghai the next year, and a consumer version is set to launch sometime in 2017, supported by an iTunes-style library of different recipes. Primo Toys are designed to help children learn, play and create with technology. Their first release is a wooden robot called Cubetto that helps teach young children how to code through tactile learning. Cubetto is placed atop a map on a floor mat and the child puts coloured blocks on a board that tell the smiling robot where to go.  The company was founded in 2013 by Matteo Loglio and Filippo Yacob to help kids become creators of technology rather than just consumers. They've attracted a total of $1.18 million (PS950,000) in funding so far, from investors including Randi Zuckerberg, the sister of Facebook founder Mark. Cubetto is currently available to buy for $225 (PS180).  London-based startup Emotech has designed what it bills as \"the first personal robot with individual personality.\" The deep-learning capabilities of the voice-controlled device known as \"Olly\" let it adapt to the personality of its user over time through daily interactions. The technology won the creators four different CES Innovation Awards in 2017. The robotics startup was founded in August 2014 to explore ways of improving the relationships between people and technology and has already secured $10 million (PS8 million) of Series A funding from Alliance Capital and Lightning Capital, plus an undisclosed amount of angel funding. Serial entrepreneur Tom Lipinski developed Q-Bot after he uncovered a problem with laying floor insulation in older homes while working on a previous project aimed at reducing domestic energy use. Q-Bot is his solution. The tiny four-wheeled robot is inserted through an air vent armed with a 3D scanner and insulating foam to survey the underside of floorboards and apply insulation as required. Q-Bot was founded in 2012 and won best startup at the Invention and Entrepreneurship in Robotics and Automation Awards in Seattle in 2015. The system has been trialled with clients including Camden Council and CityWest Homes, and the company claims it can save between PS200 and PS300 a year in energy bills. A total of PS2 million has been invested in Q-Bot from the EU Horizon 2020 Programme and two rounds of seed funding. Starship Technologies develops small self-driving robots designed to deliver goods locally within 30 minutes. The electric six-wheeled personal couriers drive on pavements at a pedestrian speed of four miles per hour to the location of the customer who then unlock the delivery using their personal code. The startup is headquartered in London but its engineering operations are based in Estonia. Skype co-founders Janus Friis and Ahti Heinla created the company in 2015 and have gained $17.2 million (PS13.8 million) of funding from eight investors including HOF Capital and Playfair Capital. Dr Alexander Enoch developed his idea for Robotical while working with bulky machines during his PhD in Robotics studies at the University of Edinburgh. The compact bipedal robot called Marty harnesses the power of play to teach computer skills to children by letting them reprogramme the device and customise its 3D-printed parts. The company has received funding from the the Royal Academy of Engineering's Enterprise Hub and more than PS86,000 on a crowdfunding platform. Marty is currently available at a special pre-order price of PS99 plus shipping. ",

    "title": "A London-based VC has just raised a $500 million fund to invest in 'deep tech' startups",
    "content": "Reuters/Issei Kato Silk Ventures, a venture capital firm backed by the Chinese government and based in London, has raised its first fund worth $500m (PS388m). The firm is eyeing up investments in \"deep tech\" startups in Europe and the US with potential to expand in China, including areas such as artificial intelligence and robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), fintech and medtech. Half of the cash, which will go into startups raising series A rounds and beyond, will come from China's state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) with the rest of the cash raised from other as yet unnamed corporations. Silk Ventures is run out of Canary Wharf's Level39 fintech space and has offices in Silicon Valley and China and first launched in 2015 as an accelerator. Alumni include challenger bank Revolut, cyber security startup Digital Shadows and soon to IPO adtech startup SuperAwesome. \"We are globally aligned with expert partners in the US, Europe and Asia to work with China at the highest levels to ensure that our portfolio companies are not only well-funded, but have the best chance of success in the Asian market,\" said founding partner Angelica Anton, a former investment advisor to the Chinese government and at the venture arm of property group Quintessentially, Q Ventures. \"Silk Ventures was built to change the way Chinese capital marries Western technologies, and we pride ourselves on the cultural and operational know-how within our expanding team.\" The firm has also added six new partners to its fold, including Brewer Stone, an advisor on Alibaba's IPO and the ex-head of Asia at Prudential. The UK is becoming increasingly attractive to Asian firms looking to scout out the latest in technology development. China Equity Group and Hanxin Capital last year launched Cocoon Networks with PS500m to invest in European startups and a 70,000 sq ft tech incubator in east London with University College London. Chinese conglomerate Kuang-Chi intends to make more investments in UK tech after taking a PS30m stake in a Dorset-based maker of jetpacks. And Japan's Softbank chose the capital to base its $100bn meg-fund. Read the original article on City AM. Copyright 2017.",

The Chinese startup, which also has a US division based in San Jose, has raised $1 billion in funding from notable names like Tencent Holdings, Baidu, Sequoia Capital, and Lenovo. Not only will it compete against the likes of Ford and General Motors when it comes to self-driving tech, but it will look to take on Tesla in the electric space. Nio will first make its big play in China, where the company has manufacturing partnerships with JAC Motors. It plans to introduce its electric SUV, the Nio ES8, to the Chinese market in early 2018. The seven-seater will be capable of Level 2 autonomy, the same as Tesla, though additional specs have yet to be released. But the SUV's autonomous capabilities will play an important role in the company's US ambitions. Nio will use the data collected by its Chinese SUV to develop the software for a Level 4, all-electric car -- a strategy straight from the Tesla handbook. The startup's autonomous driving team is led by Jamie Carlson, a former engineer for Tesla Autopilot who also worked on Apple's Special Projects team -- the division generally understood to be working on Apple's secretive car project. Nio's fully autonomous vehicle will be introduced to the US market in 2020 -- which is being spearheaded by CEO Padmasree Warrior, one of the most powerful women in tech. Nio US CEO Padmasree Warrior Bloomberg Warrior is the former CTO and Chief Strategy Officer of Cisco. She left the company in 2015 during an internal restructuring when Chuck Robbins took over as CEO. During her 8-year tenure at Cisco, Warrior regularly gave presentations and often served as the face of the company. Her career began at Motorola, where she worked for 23 years and ultimately served as CTO. Warrior told Business Insider her background in mobile is key to Nio's US ambitions, which plans to primarily compete in the connected car space. \"The problem with today's car is they try to emulate the smartphone interface and smartphone capability into the car. But the smartphone is not just a better cell phone, it's fundamentally a very different device,\" she said. \"We want to be the first company that builds the next-generation mobile space.\" Warrior said Nio is developing a \"living space that moves you.\" The idea is: if the car can drive itself, you should be able to do everything from sleep, watch movies, and take conference calls within a comfortable and high-tech ecosystem. Nio plans to develop an artificial intelligence assistant, like Siri, that can help control aspects of the car as well as your home. The startup's concept car, which debuted at this year's SXSW, featured a heads-up display and reclining seats. It will serve as the basis of the 2020 production car. Nio's concept car introduced at SXSW. NIO Naturally, Nio's vision isn't anything new. Companies like BMW have built concept cars with reclining seats and flat-screen TVs to show how vehicles will become more like living rooms with advents in automation. Some companies have already taken the plunge to make cars an extension of the home, like Ford, which has connected Amazon's Alexa to its new vehicles. But Warrior said automakers are more limited in their ability to build a true digital ecosystem because of pre-existing relationships with manufacturers and supply chains. Warrior may not be off-base with that assessment. Car manufacturers have generally struggled when it comes to in-vehicle navigation and entertainment systems in today's cars. \"If you think of some of my lessons learned in the cell-phone industry, it took an Apple to come and create something like a smartphone,\" Warrior said. \"It was not the existing manufactures of cell phones who had been around for 75, 80 years as market leaders.\" Research firm J.D. Power found that 50% of car owners never used their infotainment systems after 90 days of purchase in a 2016 study, and a Deloitte survey of 22,000 consumers in 17 different countries found that this trend is unlikely to change. For automakers to truly compete when it comes to a brand new in-vehicle experience, they'll have to throw out the rulebook and start over. \"I think this change will require a newcomer to fundamentally design the vehicle differently, engineer the vehicle differently,\" she continued. The interior of Nio's concept car introduced at SXSW. NIO Although Nio is taking an \"inside out\" approach to developing its cars, the startup is still considering other innovations beyond the digital space, such as with charging. \"Wireless charging and things like this become much more important when there's a self-driving car, so definitely that's on our horizon,\" she said. \"We are looking at that.\" That would dovetail with Nio's vision for its electric SUV in China, which will come with a swappable battery. Nio declined to provide an estimated range for the vehicle, but said it will be competitive with long-range cars today. That means it would required a range of at least 250 miles to compete with the Chevy Bolt and higher-end Tesla models. Nio is currently testing a fleet of autonomous vehicles in California and has a group of 320 employees in San Jose working on the project. The vehicle will use lidar, a key-but-expensive sensor that helps autonomous vehicles detect objects, but Nio declined to name any suppliers it's working with. The car will be priced \"below six figures\" when it's released in 2020. Nio will face steep competition in the space as Waymo, Ford, General Motors, and Uber all look to ramp up their self-driving car efforts. It will also face challenges in the electric space from Tesla, which is making a bigger push into China, and potentially Lucid Motors, a newcomer with a similar digital strategy as Nio. But Warrior said the company will stand out not only because of its laser focus on the self-driving-car interior, but because it plans to sell directly to consumers at a time where most companies are rolling out the tech in ride-hailing or car-sharing fleets. \"We want humans to get their time back free from the chore of driving,\" she said. \"Our vision of the car is a computer on wheels.\"",

    "title": "A 22-year-old who lives with his parents stopped the worldwide malware hack by registering a domain for $10.69",
    "content": "PA The \"accidental hero\" who halted the global spread of an unprecedented ransomware attack by registering a garbled domain name hidden in the malware has warned the attack could be rebooted. The ransomware used in Friday's attack wreaked havoc on organizations including FedEx and Telefonica, as well as the UK's National Health Service (NHS), where operations were cancelled, X-rays, test results and patient records became unavailable and phones did not work. But the spread of the attack was brought to a sudden halt when one UK cybersecurity researcher tweeting as @malwaretechblog, with the help of Darien Huss from security firm Proofpoint, found and inadvertently activated a \"kill switch\" in the malicious software. The researcher, who identified himself only as MalwareTech, is a 22-year-old from south-west England who works for Kryptos logic, an LA-based threat intelligence company. \"I was out having lunch with a friend and got back about 3 p.m. and saw an influx of news articles about the NHS and various UK organisations being hit,\" he told the Guardian. \"I had a bit of a look into that and then I found a sample of the malware behind it, and saw that it was connecting out to a specific domain, which was not registered. So I picked it up not knowing what it did at the time.\" The kill switch was hard coded into the malware in case the creator wanted to stop it spreading. This involved a very long nonsensical domain name that the malware makes a request to - just as if it was looking up any website - and if the request comes back and shows that the domain is live, the kill switch takes effect and the malware stops spreading. The domain cost $10.69 and was immediately registering thousands of connections every second. MalwareTech explained that he bought the domain because his company tracks botnets, and by registering these domains they can get an insight into how the botnet is spreading. \"The intent was to just monitor the spread and see if we could do anything about it later on. But we actually stopped the spread just by registering the domain,\" he said. But the following hours were an \"emotional rollercoaster\". \"Initially someone had reported the wrong way round that we had caused the infection by registering the domain, so I had a mini freakout until I realised it was actually the other way around and we had stopped it,\" he said. MalwareTech said he preferred to stay anonymous \"because it just doesn't make sense to give out my personal information, obviously we're working against bad guys and they're not going to be happy about this.\" He also said he planned to hold onto the URL, and he and colleagues were collecting the IPs and sending them off to law enforcement agencies so they can notify the infected victims, not all of whom are aware that they have been affected. He warned people to patch their systems, adding: \"This is not over. The attackers will realize how we stopped it, they'll change the code and then they'll start again. Enable windows update, update and then reboot.\" He said he got his first job out of school without any real qualifications, having skipped university to start up a tech blog and write software. \"It's always been a hobby to me, I'm self-taught. I ended up getting a job out of my first botnet tracker, which the company I now work for saw and contacted me about, asking if I wanted a job. I've been working there a year and two months now.\" But the dark knight of the dark web still lives at home with his parents, which he joked was \"so stereotypical\". His mum, he said, was aware of what had happened and was excited, but his dad hadn't been home yet. \"I'm sure my mother will inform him,\" he said. \"It's not going to be a lifestyle change, it's just a five-minutes of fame sort of thing. It is quite crazy, I've not been able to check into my Twitter feed all day because it's just been going too fast to read. Every time I refresh it it's another 99 notifications.\" A man types on a computer keyboard in front of the displayed cyber code in this illustration picture taken March 1, 2017. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File Photo Proofpoint's Ryan Kalember said the British researcher gets \"the accidental hero award of the day\". \"They didn't realise how much it probably slowed down the spread of this ransomware\". The time that @malwaretechblog registered the domain was too late to help Europe and Asia, where many organisations were affected. But it gave people in the US more time to develop immunity to the attack by patching their systems before they were infected, said Kalember. The kill switch won't help anyone whose computer is already infected with the ransomware, and it's possible that there are other variants of the malware with different kill switches that will continue to spread. The malware was made available online on 14 April through a dump by a group called Shadow Brokers, which claimed last year to have stolen a cache of \"cyber weapons\" from the National Security Agency (NSA). Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a user's data, then demands payment in exchange for unlocking the data. This attack used a piece of malicious software called \"WanaCrypt0r 2.0\" or WannaCry, that exploits a vulnerability in Windows. Microsoft released a patch (a software update that fixes the problem) for the flaw in March, but computers that have not installed the security update remain vulnerable. I will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after i registered it, so initially it was accidental. -- MalwareTech (@MalwareTechBlog) May 13, 2017 I will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after i registered it, so initially it was accidental. The ransomware demands users pay $300 worth of cryptocurrency Bitcoin to retrieve their files, though it warns that the \"payment will be raised\" after a certain amount of time. Translations of the ransom message in 28 languages are included. The malware spreads through email. \"This was eminently predictable in lots of ways,\" said Kalember. \"As soon as the Shadow Brokers dump came out everyone [in the security industry] realised that a lot of people wouldn't be able to install a patch, especially if they used an operating system like Windows XP [which many NHS computers still use], for which there is no patch.\" Security researchers with Kaspersky Lab have recorded more than 45,000 attacks in 74 countries, including the UK, Russia, Ukraine, India, China, Italy, and Egypt. In Spain, major companies including telecommunications firm Telefonica were infected. By Friday evening, the ransomware had spread to the United States and South America, though Europe and Russia remained the hardest hit, according to security researchers Malware Hunter Team. The Russian interior ministry says about 1,000 computers have been affected.",

    "title": "Imagination Technologies' former CEO thinks foreign acquisitions like ARM shouldn't be 'normal'",
    "content": "Sir Hossein Yassaie, chairman of tech industry group TechWorks and former CEO of Imagination Technologies. TechWorks Sir Hossein Yassaie, the former chief executive of Imagination Technologies, has said he \"doesn't like\" Softbank's acquisition of British chipmaker ARM. Japan's Softbank bought ARM for PS24 billion last year, the biggest British tech acquisition to date. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has used the acquisition as an example of how the UK can be successful after it leaves the EU. But leading tech figures, like Yassaie, don't agree. \"I'm one of those people that really doesn't like the idea of ARM being acquired by a foreign investor,\" he said. \"I don't mind saying it. I know you can paint a positive picture [of] inward investment, that's great, but we need big UK tech companies which are here for the long term and make a big impact. That's a problem and we need to recognise it.\" Yassaie was speaking at the relaunch of NMI, a non-profit organisation for the semiconductor industry. NMI has become TechWorks, and expanded to include \"deep tech\" like artificial intelligence and the internet of things. The group will lobby government, and try to encourage UK talent to stay in the UK and build businesses. Yassaie is currently the group's chairman. Speaking to Business Insider, Yassaie said of the ARM acquisition: \"As a British entrepreneur, I would prefer firmly based UK companies competing on the global stage, securing business that makes a difference to the country.\" SoftBank chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon He added: \"If I had to defend the case ... it's not bad to have overseas investment in the UK that's fine, I don't think that's something we want to have as normal.\" ARM's founder, Hermann Hauser, made similar comments after the sale. Both he and ARM's CEO, Simon Segars, sit on TechWorks' board. Yassaie has been out of the public eye since stepping down as CEO of Imagination Technologies, ARM's biggest competitor in the UK. He was one of the longest serving British tech CEOs, but resigned last February, when the company said it would make a loss for the year. Yassaie was integral to Imagination Technologies' deal with Apple, with the company providing graphics and video IP to the iPhone maker. Imagination is in trouble after Apple ditched that partnership, and the company sold two core business units to stay afloat. \"I love Imagination Technologies,\" Yassaie said, adding about his departure: \"It was quite clear the company, or some of the shareholders, wanted a different direction. I'm still a shareholder, and I believe there's a lot of technology in Imagination. It has a lot of built-in punch, and I'll wait to see what happens.\" Since his departure, he's a become a board member and advisor to Bristol-based Ultrahaptics, and Australia-based Atomos, a customer of Imagination Technologies. He's particularly focused on making sure UK tech talent stays in the UK. Ultrahaptics CEO Steve Cliffee and CTO Tom Carter Ultrahaptics During his TechWorks presentation, he showed Oxford University figures demonstrating that just 11% of UK tech PhD graduates stay in the UK, while 40% move abroad to work for US tech firms. \"We create this talent, and lose it to the US,\" he said. \"We haven't been able to create a Google or Apple yet, but we certainly have the underlying capability to achieve that. Deep tech is at the centre of that.\" Yassaie isn't the first tech figure to speak out since the ARM acquisition. Ken Mulvany, CEO of artificial intelligence firm BenevolentAI, has said British startups sell too early. He told Business Insider in February: There's a real opportunity to build a business in this country, and there's an opportunity for the country to lead this sector, and all the pieces are in place. We've got incredible scientists, incredible mathematicians, we're able to draw all these people into London.\"",

    "title": "Startup bank Tandem cuts headcount after funding setback",
    "content": "Ricky Knox, cofounder and CEO of Tandem. Tandem LONDON -- Startup digital bank Tandem has cut its headcount by around 30 people after seeing PS29 million ($37.3 million) in funding fall through earlier this year. A source told Business Insider that Tandem has reduced its staffing levels from around 110 to close to 80. The headcount reduction includes both redundancies and contractors who have not been renewed. The cutbacks follow the collapse of a significant funding round earlier this year. Tandem announced last December that it had secured a PS35 million investment from department store House of Fraser. However, House of Fraser is owned by China's Sanpower and a crackdown from Beijing on capital flight led to the investment falling through after Tandem had received just PS6 million of the PS35 million. Tandem said at the time that it would look to restructure its business \"to ensure a tight focus on delivering its customer vision and bringing its products to the market as quickly as possible.\" Ricky Knox, the cofounder of Tandem, told Business Insider: \"We actually had quite a few contractors in the room and we now have almost none. That made sense because when you're going into your digital build to make sure you've got enough people to get the product out there you need to add some extra heads in.\" The headcount cut follows a round of redundancies earlier in the year, prior to the funding fall through. BI reported in March that Tandem had let around 10 staff go, bringing headcount at the time down to around 110. Knox told BI: \"I think these businesses should be running with a 50-100 person staff base and pre-Christmas we'd gone over that. \"We've restructured the team, moving from build to operate. We've been mainly a tech dev house for the last few years and through this year we've been building up and adding actually operational personnel. There's been quite a bit of shift over the course of the last 6 months. It's definitely not a one-way street. Tandem is in \"advanced\" funding talks to secure investment to cover the shortfall left by House of Fraser, Knox said, although he wouldn't elaborate further on who might invest or the timeline for closure. Asked if Tandem would be expanding its staff after the investment was secured, Knox said: \"Will we need to add some more people with a few specialist skills? For sure. But are we planning to expand this team and be 250 people in a year's time? No, that's not our objective at all. My dream would be that we keep under 100 forever but that's not going to happen.\" Tandem, founded in 2014, is one of a number of app-only banks set up in Britain in recent years. Others include Monzo, Atom, and Starling. Tandem has raised over PS25 million to date from investors including eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. The collapse of the House of Fraser funding led Tandem to delay the launch of its savings product but Knox told BI the company is still going ahead with the launch of its credit card product, which is set to debut within months. He added that House of Fraser is still keen to cooperate with Tandem in offering financial products to the department store's customers.",

The Los Angeles-based startup Naritiv built its business on Snapchat, becoming one of the first companies to help connect marketers to influencers on the budding social app in late 2014. Now the firm is attempting to entirely shift its business model by becoming a digital publisher rather than a marketing services firm. To that end, it's recently rolled out a new media brand: WeBuyGold. To get WeBuyGold off the ground, the firm is shifting its focus from Snapchat to rival Instagram. According to Naritiv cofounder and CEO Daniel Altmann, the decision to plant its flag on Instagram was driven by the explosive growth in Instagram Stories, the Snapchat-inspired feature that now reaches 200 million users a day, as well as the back-end data and analytics offered by the Facebook-owned app. It's those tools that make it easier for media companies to build audiences, figure out what content is working and ultimately make more money. Jason Merritt/GettyPlus, Altmann said he's been intrigued by Instagram's live video offering, and more importantly the talent using the photo-centric platform. That includes DJ Khaled, an artist known for exploding on Snapchat. The hip hop mogul last month started working on a series project with WeBuyGold and is serving as the company's creative director. \"As a media company, Instagram can almost mimic what was once the role of a website,\" said Altmann. \"It's becoming a place where you can be comprehensive on your phone. Plus, we've just been tracking how dynamic the platform is. Over the last year, they keep doing things that intrigue us and we are consistently using it in different ways.\" The vision for WeBuyGold is to create a music-centric digital media outlet for a generation of consumers who are glued to their phones for entertainment and don't care much about appointment TV. And while WeBuyGold will have a presences on multiple social apps, Instagram is the focus for now, despite Naritiv's Snapchat roots. WeBuyGold's investors include Third Wave Digital, Disney, Techstars, and Greylock Partners. Overall, Snapchat has a different philosophy than Instagram, which by its nature makes it easy to find brands and follow them. Snapchat executives have said that they want the app to encourage user creativity, which can be inhibited by having businesses reach out to users in the same manner as their friends. \"Snapchat wants friends, not brands,\" said Altmann. A small digital company shifting to Instagram is hardly going to shake Snapchat's foundation. Naritiv has raised $4.3 million to date and has seven employees. Still, it's a small example of the momentum Instagram has gathered since co-opting stories and continuing its staggering growth. That growth is more glaring in light of Snapchat's slowing user adoption. Prior to its new incarnation as a publishing company, Naritiv, has helped hundreds of advertisers connect with digital influencers, including Marriott, Red Bull and the cable network Freefrom. The startup, which was born out of a Disney incubator program, emerged as part Snapchat-specializing ad agency and part tech company. It sold a proprietary analytics product to Hootsuite earlier this year. But Altmann said the plan was always to push into the media business eventually, while still working with advertisers by weaving them into content. He said that WeBuyGold has several music and lifestyle-oriented series in the works for Instagram, including an attempt at reviving Saturday Morning cartoons and a show featuring the Instagram artist Cam Kirk, who is known for photographing musical artists. \"We believe that ephemeral and mobile content are one in the same,\"Altmann said. \"When we made the decision to switch, we said 'let's create a new type of media company.'\"",

    "title": "GE is making a huge bet on its future, and not everyone is convinced it's going to work out",
    "content": "General Electric (GE) technicianSpahn uses a wireless gauge to automatically average measurements and sends the data wirelessly to his computer to read demensions of the holes in the railroad engine part on his workbench in Grove City Thomson Reuters By Alwyn Scott GROVE CITY, Penn. (Reuters) - At a General Electric factory in this rural town, Keith Spahn, 60, used to take measurements of parts from railroad locomotives that are in for repair by hand. Now he uses a tool that reads the dimensions automatically and sends them wirelessly to his computer, where software decides whether the part can be reused or must be scrapped. \"It's definitely faster,\" he says. Spahn's workbench in this 240,000-square foot plant is one small example of a multibillion-dollar bet by GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt: digital technology will transform GE's factories, generate new revenue and boost profits. The $4 billion GE has spent on developing digital products - ranging from tiny sensors in jet engines to augmented reality and software that can crunch large volumes of data - is on the scale of investments Google and Facebook made to build their businesses, Bill Ruh, CEO of GE's digital division, told Reuters. Now that GE has shed non-essential operations, including most of its large financial unit, its fortunes will rise or fall depending on whether that investment delivers. GE's technology - and similar systems by IBM, Siemens AG and others - is a hot new battleground in manufacturing. The companies promise they can spot problems before machines break down, yield cost savings of 30 percent or more, and raise labor productivity that has slowed sharply in recent years. File photo of General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt speaking at a news conference in Boston Thomson Reuters By 2020, spending on such systems is expected to exceed $500 billion a year, up from $20 billion in 2012, according to an estimate cited by consulting firm Accenture. GE says the market for the sectors it is in will be $225 billion by 2020. The company has spent $5 billion setting up new US factories in the last five years. As it now adds digital technology to its plants, it needs fewer, and higher skilled, workers than in the past. \"We're going to have a smarter worker,\" Immelt said in an interview. \"We're not going to have as many workers.\" But as investment grows, so have concerns about whether these bets will pay off - and about the cost and complexity of keeping networked machines running and secure from hackers. GE investors are especially impatient for returns. Since Immelt became CEO in 2001, GE shares have fallen 29 percent while the S&P 500 index has more than doubled. GE's dividend is seven cents lower than it was in 2008. That performance has some pressing for more urgency from Immelt. When activist investor Nelson Peltz bought a $2.5 billion GE stake in 2015, he pressed for asset sales and cost cutting, and barely mentioned GE's digital strategy as a source of growth. Trian declined to comment for this article. In March, Peltz reached an agreement with GE that tied the bonuses of top executives to cutting $2 billion in costs and hitting profit targets through 2017. Those targets don't rely on GE's digital strategy. \"People aren't saying they don't like the technology\" or that GE is investing too much in digital, said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \"But how does it translate into profit margins and cash?\" GE poses an important test of the digital factory idea. It has more than 500 factories around the globe that produce jet engines, power plants, medical CT scanners and other large, sophisticated equipment adaptable to the technology. GE also earns very little from selling hardware. Nearly half of its revenue and most of its profit come from selling services, a natural fit for the monitoring and data analysis that are the core of a computerized factory. Getty Images In addition to improving its own productivity, GE sells the \"Brilliant Factory\" as a product, promising a combination of its digital systems with advanced manufacturing techniques, 3-D printing and lean production principles pioneered by Toyota Motor Corp. Take the industrial operating system called Predix. GE spent more than $1 billion to create it along with applications that can analyze terabytes of data from jet engines or factory machines along with other data, such as weather or energy costs. GE's venture capital arm is buying stakes in startups that adapt robots, optical scanners and augmented reality to work with Predix. Last year, GE spent $1.1 billion on two makers of industrial 3-D printers, planning both to use the printers and sell them. Predix systems work, in part, by creating a computerized model, or \"digital twin,\" of a machine that shows in real time how it is performing, and when parts are wearing out. This can eliminate unplanned breakdowns, GE says, saving time and money. The system also creates a \"digital thread\" that logs, like a medical record, every aspect of a machine's life - from initial assembly to repairs during its years of operation. At GE's Grove City factory, digital systems that were installed in the last 18 months time workers down to the second. Flat screens over work bays count how long crews are spending and turn red when jobs are taking too long. \"I can look at that screen and see everything I need to know about how things are running,\" said Richard Simpson, vice president of supply chain at GE Transportation, pointing to a display. Even though it is still a grimy, greasy industrial shop, Grove City is one of 17 \"showcases\" GE plans to have by year-end, helping it sell its systems to outside customers. When a massive railroad engine rolls in for repair, workers check the digital twin to see what parts need to be fixed. The system ensures spares are in stock. Older engines are fitted with sensors so they can supply that data next time. The process saves labor by eliminating unnecessary work. \"Instead of full tear downs, the factory workers can refurbish just the parts that need it,\" said Anup Sharma, a general manager at GE Digital. \"That frees them up to do value added work and gets the engine back to the customer sooner.\" GE executives say the company has reaped $1 billion in productivity gains during the last two years, with $700 million more expected in 2017. Those gains are being reinvested into Predix and applications, so they have not had a large effect on GE's earnings, the executives said. The gains are not broken out for investors to see. GE's digital business expects new orders to jump 25 percent to $5 billion this year, said GE digital division CEO Ruh, resulting in $4 billion in revenue for the division from sales to companies such as Exelon Corp and BP PLC . By 2020, GE expects $15 billion in revenue from its digital division. Charlie Smith, Chief Investment Officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group, with $2.1 billion under management, owns GE, IBM and other industrial companies and believes digital will ultimately pay off. But he shares the skepticism of many investors. \"I'm not completely all in on GE,\" Smith said. \"There's very little revenue from digital so far.\" GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview that the digital division \"will become real for investors\" when it begins to boost revenue and profits, starting in 2019 or 2020. GE has no choice but to invest in the strategy, he added. \"If we don't do this then somebody else is going to,\" Bornstein said. \"That is not a good thing.\" (Editing by Joseph White and Edward Tobin) Read the original article on Reuters.

    "title": "The founder of a college startup more exclusive than Harvard or Stanford says traditional applications don't measure anything but wealth",
    "content": "Minerva students in Berlin. Marcus Reichmann Minerva Schools, a college startup based in San Francisco, California, believes that the traditional model for college is failing students. Based on application numbers for the Minerva Class of 2021, it seems that there may be tens of thousands of students that agree. In just its fourth year accepting applications, the unconventional college received 20,427, admitting 385 students. That acceptance rate, at 1.9%, is far lower than at any schools in the Ivy League or Stanford. However, the startup doesn't aim to be another elite private school. Its model vastly differs from four years of school in the prestigious Ivy League. Take the admissions process, for example. Ben Nelson, who founded Minerva five years ago, believes the traditional admissions process measures income, rather than aptitude and effort. \"Our application does not expose anything about the student that indicates their wealth,\" Nelson told Business Insider. \"A traditional application that claims not to, exposes it everywhere,\" he continued. Minerva students studying in a cafe. Marcus Reichmann For example, Minerva doesn't want to know any information about parent or sibling background, and does not accept the SAT or ACT. \"Two hundred points on your SAT can be directly attributed to your wealth,\" Nelson said. There is no prewritten college admissions essay, which Nelson said is \"a wonderful measure of how well your college counselor worked with your mother.\" And extracurriculars that can in essence buy admission to prestigious schools -- recruitment to the sailing team, water polo, or other typically pricey sports -- are similarly ignored, Nelson said. Instead, Minerva has its own set of assessments and essays that are done live on camera and recorded. This includes an oral and a written interview. \"No college coach can help,\" Nelson said. While Minerva is need blind, and offers full financial aid to those in need, its full-price tuition, room and board, fees still come in at $29,450 -- which is less than what Harvard and Stanford charge, but is still significant. Classes also differ from those at a traditional college. For one thing, students don't stay in one place during their four-year education. They spend time in up to seven residence houses in San Francisco, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Seoul, Hyderabad, Taipei, and London. Ben Nelson. The Minerva Project About 80% percent of Minerva's students come from outside the US. The Ivy League's percentages are roughly the inverse of that figure, with roughly 10% to 15% international students. There is a strong focus on critical thinking and communication skills in academic coursework. Students earn bachelor's degrees in Arts & Humanities, Computational Sciences, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, and Business. There are also two graduate degrees that students can work toward, and still graduate in four years. Still, there are some unknown variables in what a Minerva degree will provide. Salary of recent graduates and job placement metrics, for example, are nonexistent. That's because the first cohort of Minerva students has yet to graduate. But interest continues to grow for Minerva. Applications were up 26% from the previous year, perhaps indicating that prospective college students are interested in nontraditional post-secondary education.",

    "title": "Imagination Technologies' former CEO thinks foreign acquisitions like ARM shouldn't be 'normal'",
    "content": "Sir Hossein Yassaie, chairman of tech industry group TechWorks and former CEO of Imagination Technologies. TechWorks Sir Hossein Yassaie, the former chief executive of Imagination Technologies, has said he \"doesn't like\" Softbank's acquisition of British chipmaker ARM. Japan's Softbank bought ARM for PS24 billion last year, the biggest British tech acquisition to date. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has used the acquisition as an example of how the UK can be successful after it leaves the EU. But leading tech figures, like Yassaie, don't agree. \"I'm one of those people that really doesn't like the idea of ARM being acquired by a foreign investor,\" he said. \"I don't mind saying it. I know you can paint a positive picture [of] inward investment, that's great, but we need big UK tech companies which are here for the long term and make a big impact. That's a problem and we need to recognise it.\" Yassaie was speaking at the relaunch of NMI, a non-profit organisation for the semiconductor industry. NMI has become TechWorks, and expanded to include \"deep tech\" like artificial intelligence and the internet of things. The group will lobby government, and try to encourage UK talent to stay in the UK and build businesses. Yassaie is currently the group's chairman. Speaking to Business Insider, Yassaie said of the ARM acquisition: \"As a British entrepreneur, I would prefer firmly based UK companies competing on the global stage, securing business that makes a difference to the country.\" SoftBank chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon He added: \"If I had to defend the case ... it's not bad to have overseas investment in the UK that's fine, I don't think that's something we want to have as normal.\" ARM's founder, Hermann Hauser, made similar comments after the sale. Both he and ARM's CEO, Simon Segars, sit on TechWorks' board. Yassaie has been out of the public eye since stepping down as CEO of Imagination Technologies, ARM's biggest competitor in the UK. He was one of the longest serving British tech CEOs, but resigned last February, when the company said it would make a loss for the year. Yassaie was integral to Imagination Technologies' deal with Apple, with the company providing graphics and video IP to the iPhone maker. Imagination is in trouble after Apple ditched that partnership, and the company sold two core business units to stay afloat. \"I love Imagination Technologies,\" Yassaie said, adding about his departure: \"It was quite clear the company, or some of the shareholders, wanted a different direction. I'm still a shareholder, and I believe there's a lot of technology in Imagination. It has a lot of built-in punch, and I'll wait to see what happens.\" Since his departure, he's a become a board member and advisor to Bristol-based Ultrahaptics, and Australia-based Atomos, a customer of Imagination Technologies. He's particularly focused on making sure UK tech talent stays in the UK. Ultrahaptics CEO Steve Cliffee and CTO Tom Carter Ultrahaptics During his TechWorks presentation, he showed Oxford University figures demonstrating that just 11% of UK tech PhD graduates stay in the UK, while 40% move abroad to work for US tech firms. \"We create this talent, and lose it to the US,\" he said. \"We haven't been able to create a Google or Apple yet, but we certainly have the underlying capability to achieve that. Deep tech is at the centre of that.\" Yassaie isn't the first tech figure to speak out since the ARM acquisition. Ken Mulvany, CEO of artificial intelligence firm BenevolentAI, has said British startups sell too early. He told Business Insider in February: There's a real opportunity to build a business in this country, and there's an opportunity for the country to lead this sector, and all the pieces are in place. We've got incredible scientists, incredible mathematicians, we're able to draw all these people into London.\"",

    "title": "Improbable's CEO on its huge new $500 million funding round: 'It's about sending a signal'",
    "content": "Herman Narula, CEO of Improbable. Improbable LONDON -- UK startup Improbable has raised announced a mammoth $502 million (PS390 million) cash injection from Japanese firm Softbank. CEO Herman Narula says Improbable is determined to stay independent, despite concerns about foreign firms buying out British businesses. The vast funding round is, he told Business Insider, about \"sending a signal.\" Improbable is developing software for simulating virtual worlds. Simply put, it builds the tools that people can use to run massive simulations -- whether that's online games or scientific research projects -- meaning its customers can get on with the business of simulating whatever it is they actually want to do. Its $502 million investment is, by any measure, massive -- whether for a British or an American technology business. But it's an order of magnitude larger than all of Improbable's previous funding rounds put together. Before this, it had raised just $50 million (PS38 million) in total. Improbable is staying tight-lipped on how much the investment values it at. Narula said only that it gives Softbank a \"non-controlling stake.\" That is, Softbank owns less than 50% of the company -- valuing it overall at least $1 billion (PS778 million). (He wouldn't even be drawn on the range or a ballpark figure, saying that he doesn't \"want to create that distraction of high numbers.\") Inside Improbable's offices. Improbable Although Improbable might want to stay independent, there is along list of promising British tech business that have ultimately been bought out by foreign firms. London artificial intelligence lab Deepmind was acquired by Google for PS400 million. Twitter dropped up to $150 million (PS116 million) to acquire Magic Pony. Chinese travel company Ctrip bought Scottish firm Skyscanner for PS1.4 billion. Softbank is currently doubling down on its investments, and is launching a vast $100 billion (PS77 billion) tech investment fund (though, per TechCrunch, the Improbable investment is not coming from it). In 2013, Softbank bought a 51% stake in Finnish gaming company Supercell, before upping it to 73% (and then subsequently selling it off to Tencent). Might Softbank seek to similarly increase its share of Improbable until it has a controlling stake? \"We have absolutely no interest in that kind of deal,\" Narula said. \"Our goal is to remain independent. The control aspects of this deal were very important to us ... The company is completely founder-controlled, and will remain so. We can't realise this vision as an acquisition of anyone.\" His position then softened slightly: \"It's also personally important to us to, as long as it is feasible, try to create a significant British platform company, and you know, we think we can do that and that's not something we want to give up easily.\" So would he consider an acquisition offer under any circumstances? If Google came knocking, perhaps? \"I guess I'd say it wouldn't be about cashing out for us. If such a scenario ever made sense it would have to be because we felt it was the only way to realise our vision.\" And does he consider the number of British tech businesses selling off to foreign firms an issue? \"I think that's just harder anywhere. I don't think that's something unique to Britain. Trying to scale a company beyond this scale is an enormous challenge ... I don't think there is an easy policy of structure that's going to make this kind of thing repeatable.\" Improbable COO Peter Lipka, CEO Herman Narula, and CTO Rob Whitehead. (left-right) Improbable Founded in 2012, Improbable's initial focus was on gaming -- but has since broadened its view to everything from science to defence. In late 2015, it unveiled SpatialOS, an operating system for simulations, and launched a beta version in February 2017. The company is currently generating revenue, but its current focus is on growth. This new funding will go towards hiring, as well as developing the tech and R&D. The company currently has 180 employees, and opened a San Francisco office earlier this year. iIt plans to grow both teams, Improbable said. (Narula and cofounder and CTO Rob Whitehead are British, and based in London.) \"It's been a journey to get the fundamental technical problems solved, to show a working product ... to see the potential of the market we were exploring,\" the CEO said when asked about the rationale for the size of the fundraise. \"I guess we've now reached the point where we want to double down on that. We see a 10 year, 20 year vision for how we can make possible the massive scale simulations that could be so transformative. \"And it's not going to happen overnight, and it's something that's going to require deep and continued investment. So this is us thinking of the long-term, wanting to remain independent, and wanting to create something really special.\" Even so, Narula doesn't rule out raising further cash down the line: \"Our goal is to literally alter the way we live and work and that may very well require more capital.\" Fundamentally, the exec said, \"it's about sending a signal to the market that we are creating a new space, and we're building a new ecosystem around us, and that ecosystem is here to stay.\"",

    "title": "Startup bank Tandem cuts headcount after funding setback",
    "content": "Ricky Knox, cofounder and CEO of Tandem. Tandem LONDON -- Startup digital bank Tandem has cut its headcount by around 30 people after seeing PS29 million ($37.3 million) in funding fall through earlier this year. A source told Business Insider that Tandem has reduced its staffing levels from around 110 to close to 80. The headcount reduction includes both redundancies and contractors who have not been renewed. The cutbacks follow the collapse of a significant funding round earlier this year. Tandem announced last December that it had secured a PS35 million investment from department store House of Fraser. However, House of Fraser is owned by China's Sanpower and a crackdown from Beijing on capital flight led to the investment falling through after Tandem had received just PS6 million of the PS35 million. Tandem said at the time that it would look to restructure its business \"to ensure a tight focus on delivering its customer vision and bringing its products to the market as quickly as possible.\" Ricky Knox, the cofounder of Tandem, told Business Insider: \"We actually had quite a few contractors in the room and we now have almost none. That made sense because when you're going into your digital build to make sure you've got enough people to get the product out there you need to add some extra heads in.\" The headcount cut follows a round of redundancies earlier in the year, prior to the funding fall through. BI reported in March that Tandem had let around 10 staff go, bringing headcount at the time down to around 110. Knox told BI: \"I think these businesses should be running with a 50-100 person staff base and pre-Christmas we'd gone over that. \"We've restructured the team, moving from build to operate. We've been mainly a tech dev house for the last few years and through this year we've been building up and adding actually operational personnel. There's been quite a bit of shift over the course of the last 6 months. It's definitely not a one-way street. Tandem is in \"advanced\" funding talks to secure investment to cover the shortfall left by House of Fraser, Knox said, although he wouldn't elaborate further on who might invest or the timeline for closure. Asked if Tandem would be expanding its staff after the investment was secured, Knox said: \"Will we need to add some more people with a few specialist skills? For sure. But are we planning to expand this team and be 250 people in a year's time? No, that's not our objective at all. My dream would be that we keep under 100 forever but that's not going to happen.\" Tandem, founded in 2014, is one of a number of app-only banks set up in Britain in recent years. Others include Monzo, Atom, and Starling. Tandem has raised over PS25 million to date from investors including eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. The collapse of the House of Fraser funding led Tandem to delay the launch of its savings product but Knox told BI the company is still going ahead with the launch of its credit card product, which is set to debut within months. He added that House of Fraser is still keen to cooperate with Tandem in offering financial products to the department store's customers.",

    "title": "Buzzy British startup Improbable just got a huge $500 million cash injection",
    "content": "Rob Whitehead (left) and Herman Narula (right) of Improbable. Improbable LONDON -- Improbable, a buzzy British startup that builds tech underpinning virtual reality worlds, has landed a $500 million (PS389 million) cash injection. The investment was led by Japanese firm Softbank and it's a huge round of funding for a British startup. The cash is going towards tech development and hiring in its London HQ and San Francisco office, which it opened earlier this year. What does Improbable actually do? Basically, it builds tech that does the heavy lifting required for huge simulations -- whether that's online gaming or scientific research. This frees up the people using the virtual reality software to get on with the business of modelling whatever it is they want to model. \"Today in computer science, people have mastered apps to build things for a single computer,\" CEO Herman Narula previously told Business Insider. \"And all the power of a single computer, people can use it to do really good things. But there's this whole other wonderful set of problems that we want to solve -- like recreating whole cities, or creating beautiful virtual worlds for us to explore, or being able to recreate economies, or being able to model all the processes in company -- things that if we could do, we could do really great things.\" Founded in 2012, Improbable's initial focus was on gaming -- but has since broadened its view to everything from science to defence. In late 2015, it unveiled SpatialOS, an operating system for simulations, and launched a beta version in February 2017. Narula says in a statement on Friday announcing the investment: \"We believe that the next major phase in computing will be the emergence of large-scale virtual worlds which enrich human experience and change how we understand the real world. At Improbable we have spent the last few years building the foundational infrastructure for this vision.\" There's no word yet on exactly what this week's $502 million (PS390 million) funding round values Improbable's overall worth at. TechCrunch only reports that the company is worth more than $1 billion (PS780 million) and that Softbank's investment is a minority stake in the company -- meaning it owns less than 50% of the company. The investment is an order of magnitude larger than any previous funding Improbable has taken. Its last publicised round was in March 2015, when it brought in $20 million (PS16 million), led by Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (also known as a16z). a16z also contributed to this more recent round of funding, Improbable says, along with Horizons Ventures, another previous investor. By any standard, it's a huge amount of cash for a British firm to raise. According to Bloomberg, it is the fifth-largest VC investment in the UK in the last 10 years. Tech startups with valuations of $1 billion are more are sometimes referred to as \"unicorns\" due to their rarity -- and Improbable has now been propelled into their ranks, alongside the likes of TransferWise and Funding Circle in the UK. In a statement, Softbank managing director Deep Nishar was (predictably) effusive. He said: \"Improbable is building breakthrough technologies that are becoming vital and valuable platforms for the global gaming industry. \"Beyond gaming, this new form of simulation on a massive scale has the potential to help us make better decisions about the world we live in. Improbable's technology will help us explore disease, improve cities, understand economies and solve complex problems on a previously unimaginable scale.\" Improbable says it has already done a proof-of-concept to recreate an unnamed British city, based on open-source map, traffic, gas and electricity, water and sewage, Internet and mobile connectivity data.",

    "title": "A judge denied Uber's bid to avoid a trial with Waymo -- and referred Uber's case for a possible criminal investigation",
    "content": "Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.Reuters/StaffA judge has asked the US attorney to examine whether Uber may have broken the law and stolen technology to build self-driving cars, a stunning twist in a legal dispute between two of the tech industry's most powerful companies. The order by Judge William Alsup late on Thursday was one of two major legal setbacks that Uber suffered, with Alsup also ruling that Google's self-driving-car spinout, Waymo, could take its claims against Uber to trial, denying Uber's bid to move the case into private arbitration. Waymo sued Uber earlier this year, accusing Uber of stealing trade secrets and intellectual property it had developed related to lidar, the radar-like sensors that self-driving cars use to navigate. The case, which has pitted two of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies against each other, could affect the future of the nascent self-driving-car industry, a market analysts believe could eventually be worth tens of billions of dollars and upend the automotive and transportation industries. The dispute has already taken numerous surprising twists, including allegations of evidence being hidden from the court, theories about a shell company, and a high-profile engineer who has refused to testify and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Google previously invested in Uber, back when the ride-hailing company was still a young startup and had not yet become the world's most valuable private tech company. Uber declined to comment on the referral to the US attorney's office, but it decried the order denying its bid for arbitration. \"It is unfortunate that Waymo will be permitted to avoid abiding by the arbitration promise it requires its employees to make,\" an Uber representative told Business Insider. \"We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum.\" UberAlsup referred the case to the US attorney to examine whether Uber broke the law, raising the prospect of a potential criminal investigation into the ride-hailing company. The case is referred to the US attorney for \"investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC's claims for trade secret misappropriation,\" Alsup wrote in a separate order Thursday evening. \"The court takes no position on whether is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney.\" An additional decision regarding a preliminary injunction to stop part of Uber's self-driving-car research is also expected shortly. Alsup's denial is the first major decision in the case since the dispute between the companies kicked off in February when Waymo, the self-driving-car division that spun out of Google in December, accused Uber of stealing its trade secrets and intellectual property and of infringing on patents related to its lidar systems. Since then, Uber's lawyers have argued that Google has made its arbitration agreement overly broad when it says they have to arbitrate disputes with anyone as it relates to an individual's employment. Much of Waymo's case is built on the actions taken by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer accused of downloading 14,000 files from Google before leaving the company. Uber argued that Waymo, now a separate spinout of Google, purposefully brought the case against Uber and not Levandowski to keep it in the public spotlight and avoid its obligation to his employment agreement. While any disputes between Waymo and Levandowski would have to be bound by the employment contract, Waymo did not sue Levandowski directly; rather, it sued Uber and the companies founded by Levandowski that were acquired by Uber, including Otto. \"Defendants have repeatedly accused Waymo of using 'artful' or 'tactical' pleading to evade its arbitration obligations by omitting Levandowski as a defendant. These accusations are unwarranted,\" Alsup wrote. Instead, Alsup says Waymo followed the proper course of action. Kalanick with Anthony Levandowski.Associated Press\"Waymo has honored its obligation to arbitrate against Levandowski by arbitrating its claims (concerning employee poaching) against Levandowski,\" Alsup continued. \"Its decision to bring separate claims against defendants in court was not only reasonable but also the only course available, since Waymo had no arbitration agreement with defendants.\" \"This was a desperate bid by Uber to avoid the court's jurisdiction,\" a Waymo representative said. \"We welcome the court's decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct.\" Alsup also had a few words for Levandowski in his motion to deny arbitration, saying the sidelined head of Uber's self-driving-car division \"continues to obstruct\" after invoking his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. \"Even though he is not a defendant here, moreover, Levandowski's assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege has obstructed and continues to obstruct both discovery and defendants' ability to construct a complete narrative as to the fate of Waymo's purloined files,\" Alsup wrote.
