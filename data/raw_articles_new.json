    "content": "Success can make startups stagnant when the radicals become the establishment. Innovation is more elusive when the idea grows into a business, whose managers prioritise profits rather than products. The temptation to invest in the type of disruption that was the source of their success decreases when the existing product is bringing in big revenues. This is the \"Innovator's Dilemma\", as Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen named it in his bestselling book, which \"deeply influenced\" Steve Jobs, according to the Apple cofounder's authorised biographer. Australian collaboration software company Atlassian has developed its own method of responding to Christensen's dilemma. What began life as two university dropouts in a Sydney garage backed by a $10,000 credit card debt has grown into a $6 billion publicly-traded corporation. However the company maintains the reputation for innovation it began with. Atlassian's head of R&D and resident work futurist Dominic Price is responsible for ensuring the company stays small while scaling. \"I'm never going to get excited standing on stage saying we're 10,000 people or 20,000 people,\" says Price, a Manchester native now based in sunnier climes of Sydney. \"Customer numbers are great, but as we scaled the business we wanted to find ways of staying small, staying nimble, staying agile and essentially staying relevant. And when you decide to stay relevant you have to accept that your business model is going to change quite frequently.\" He says Atlassian stays relevant by embracing inevitability that its business model will frequently change, through a company-wide approach to innovation that helps it stay ahead of the curve while reducing financial risk. \"I'm a firm believer that there's no such thing as the lone genius, that there's not a single person at Atlassian that we all look to for these wonderful ideas and they cascade down from above,\" says Price. \"Nor do they necessarily come from the most senior people. And that's something that we've embraced, that innovation is something that exists in everyone. My job and my team's job is to create an environment where we give them an opportunity to express that.\" Atlassian has created that environment through three core policies: \"Innovate Every Day\", \"20 Percent Time\" and \"ShipIt\". 'Innovate every day' is a cultural attitude ingrained throughout the company to ensure staff question everything and spark change independently. \"If you don't like something, do something to change it,\" explains Price. \"Find out why it exists, find out what the other options are, what we could do differently, and so we see incremental change, it's a light form of innovation, but an incremental form of change occurs every day in our business.\" This culture gains structure through 20 percent time, the proportion of staff working hours they're asked to dedicate to innovation. It initially took the form of one day every week, but many teams now prefer an entire week of innovation in every five weeks at work. The activity is constrained to individual teams, who will block out any backlog and abandon their day-to-day jobs to dedicate that time exclusively to innovation. \"In this week you just come up with some random innovative ideas, and try and roll them out, try and implement them,\" says Price. \"You do that like spring cleaning, because it's for your team. And what it does is it helps our teams keep their radar alert to things that aren't necessarily working well, or the future of we could do to work this way, but when we're twice as big we might want a bit more structure here, we might want to try this. \"It puts the ownership on them to evolve their work practices, and that's really good for slightly more incremental innovation, which is still quite creative but constrained around their team.\"  The final element is ShipIt, a quarterly event that gives every member of staff around the world 24 hours to do whatever they want with whoever they want. \"The randomness of the ideas that come out of that are truly creative and curious, and they tend to spark another conversation which sparks another conversation which sparks another conversation, and it's the whole motion of try it, rather than prove it,\" says Price. \"Prove it is a killer to innovation. Prove it says unless you can scientifically give me certainty that there is a return on investment and this won't distract this core business, then I'll never do this. Well that's not innovation, that's what I did yesterday. Innovation is taking this calculated risk and trying stuff, and because there's no recourse, there's no cost of failure, people are a lot braver, so it's true out there innovation. \"The first two forms of innovation we do - innovate every day and 20 percent time - are quite within your team, working with similar people. One of the fascinating things we've found when we do ShipIt, is people seek out to work with people they've never worked with before. In completely random tangential teams to theirs, because you can learn something new. It's a great way of changing your frame of reference.\" The only rule is that at the end they must give a three-minute talk about what they've developed, and vote for the teams whose ideas they like best. The winners get a tacky trophy and a t-shirt, but the real prize is bragging rights, and the development of ideas that can influence others in the audience. \"Whilst the stimulus is in that 24 hours and the three-minute talks, the life of the ideas that get created live on for the following three months, and then ship it comes along again, so this cycle just repeats,\" says Price. ShipIt has resulted in a number of big products, such as JIRA Service Desk, a hosted helpdesk for resolving customer requests. The initial idea from the presentation was developed over a series of weeks into a prototype model and then the full version of today. They also redesigned the company's onboarding experience for new staff, by drawing directly on the experiences of new members of the team, rather than solely relying on the knowledge of HR professionals Measuring quantifiable benefits, however, is a more difficult task. Evaluating success by the number of ideas that are incorporated, for example, can lead engineers to only work on safe ideas they know will ship, reducing the risk that is at the heart of true innovation. Instead they measure lead indicators, such as rates of participation and engagement. \"If I see incremental innovation in ShipIt, that tells me something's going wrong, we're being too conservative,\" explains Price. \"If I just see stupid random ideas but people having fun with it, it's purely cultural, it's just a bit of fun. What I'm looking for is that combination of people trying to scratch an itch and find a new way of solving that problem. \"If I see that en masse, I'm happy. However many ship, I don't care, because some of them end up in other people's roadmaps. A lot of the time we get similar ideas but approached in different ways, and we say to those teams you should get together and find out how you finish that, because the three of you have all approached it differently, I'd love to see what happens when you join forces.\" ",

    "content": "Advice on the best tablets for startups and entrepreneurs. It's iPad vs Android vs Surface Pro for the title of best tablet for business. Let's face it, you are likely to buy an iPad. But if you are trying to start or grow a business, your choice of personal tech is critically important. You want something that is portable and powerful and able to support you in working wherever you are. But you also need something that looks the part without breaking the bank. Here is our guide to the best tablet for startups and entrepreneurs.  The most popular individual brand of tablet, Apple's iPad is slick and simple to use. Secure and with the best app support on the market. It's not cheap though, and you will need an adaptor for most projectors, which is an issue when presenting. We recommend the iPad Pro 9.7-inch. It's more affordable than the 12.9-inch model and feels more like a tablet for both work and play due to it's smaller screen and ultra portability. However, if you'll be using it for mostly work, the 9.7 Smart Keyboard is on the small side of detachable keyboards. The iPad Pro will be at the top end of most people's budgets, coming in at between PS549 to PS1,029. If you definitely want to go with Apple, there is a slightly cheaper alternative. Simply called the iPad, Apple's newest release will set you back between PS339 and PS559 depending on the model and specs you choose.  You can get an Android tablet that is every bit as good as the Apple equivalent, and it will cost less. But you need to know what you are getting: the Android world is a very mixed bunch.  Android plus points include universal USB support, and the ease with which you can transfer from PC or Mac to Android tablet. App support remains patchy, however, and there is a minor security risk. Designed entirely by Google, the Pixel C is a great option for people wanting a tablet and keyboard attachment for long days at the office and for watching films or TV shows on the go, although it will set you back PS479.99. However, when it comes to Android tablets, the Sony Experia Z4 shouldn't be overlooked. The Z4 is a worthy rival to the iPad Air 2. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 is also a great choice for an Android tablet as it offers solid specs, a great screen and a lightweight design. This tablet comes in at around PS329. The latest Samsung tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, was released in March 2017. It has  an impressive display, the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 CPU and expandable storage of up to 256GB thanks to the inclusion of a microSD card slot. It's a pretty impressive tablet, and this is reflected in the price. It costs around PS599.99. Check out PC Advisor's Best tablets list to be sure you are getting what you need. Hands down one of the best tablets for business, Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 is a power PC in tablet form. No other tablet offers you full use of full Windows: any software you can run on a PC, you can run on Surface Pro. The keyboard cases are brilliant, too, meaning that the Surface Pro really is the tablet that can replace your laptop. For real. Downsides? It is - as you would expect - expensive.  Price points range between PS749 and PS1669. Depending on which specs and accessories you go for, this tablet would be a huge investment. But its impressive specs could make it all worth it. The Surface Pro 4 offers a crisp 2736x1824 screen resolution, up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage (although the 1TB model is not available in the UK just yet) and a 6th-generation Skylake Intel Core M3 processor, making it one powerful machine. However, you might want to hold off buying it as it is rumoured that the Surface Pro 5 could be released this summer.  You can dial down the price and get a Windows tablet from the likes of Dell or HP. Just be sure you know what you are getting. A cheaper Windows tablet may have a poor quality screen, anaemic performance and poor connectivity. Worst of all: it may have poor battery life. Always check the specs, read reviews, and seek advice before you buy. The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S is a good option for those wanting a relatively high spec tablet with detachable keyboard without the Apple price tag (although, it's not exactly cheap). Otherwise, the Chuwi Hi10 Pro and Microsoft Surface Pro 3 are all solid options at more attainable prices. The best convertible tablet/PC hybrids can be a good compromise between power and portability. The worst? Hopelessly hamstrung devices that are good at neither. And there are more of the latter than the former.  Typically convertibles are fat and heavy tablets with cramped keyboards attached. Unless you can really shell out, we suggest avoiding and getting a thin and light laptop.  However, if you are set on a hybrid machine, the Asus Transformer Book Flip and the Lenovo Yoga 900-131SK are good choices. ",

    "content": "Advice on the best smartphones for businesses, startups and entrepreneurs. (See also: Best tablets for business 2017.) Let's face it, lots of people will choose an iPhone. But you would be wrong to do so - both in terms of keeping down costs, and of getting the right tool for the job. You need a phone that can help you work on the move, but also need something that will allow you to work across multiple devices, and to secure your data. Reader, you need an Android phone or a BlackBerry that runs Android.  Here is our guide to the best smartphones for businesses, startups and entrepreneurs. Apple's smartphones remain unsurpassed in terms of build quality. Unsurpassed, but not out on their own.  Some of Microsoft's Windows Phones and virtually all high-end Androids can match the iPhone's build quality, and most don't require a case to protect all that precious aluminium. Meanwhile, Apple's performance is pretty great, but not noticeably better than the best Android phones.  The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, will have some loyal Apple users jump at the chance of a bigger screen and the newest iPhone on the market. However, going for a slightly older version could save you money and make sure you don't lose out on features.  So if you're really set on getting an iPhone, you could save yourself a bit of cash and go for the iPhone 6s Plus as it houses all the functionality of the iPhone 7 Plus but comes at a reduced price tag. Although, with Apple most likely releasing a new iPhone this year, you could hold of and go for the iPhone 7 which will probably reduce in price.  In March 2017, Apple released the iPhone 7 in partnership with RED, meaning some of the money from each purchase will go to helping those with AIDs and HIV. However, it is only available in 128GB or 256GB. Should you, then, plump for an Android? Quite possibly, but this is not without problems of its own. Android phones can be picked up relatively cheaply and if you go for a high-end model, you can get specs unrivalled by other manufacturers. However its open platform does mean that security can be an issue, something which you will see less of if you go for an iPhone. March 2017 marked the release of the Samsung Galaxy S8, which is rumoured to be the best phone to buy on the market, if you have a spare PS689 that is. And while the specs of the S8 aren't actually that dissimilar to its predecessor (which is fantastic), you will receive a better screen and access to Bixby, Samsung's version of Siri or Google Assistant.  Phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge still offer great displays, expandable storage, and compatibility with all USB-powered peripherals. And because it is Android, your device will be customisable, and compatible with Google Docs, as well as all the other Google tools you use such as Analytics, or Google Drive. So then, there is always the BlackBerry. Contrary to popular belief the old BlackBerry is still alive and kicking out new phones. And the two most recent ones - the BlackBerry Classic and BlackBerry Passport - are really good. For a BlackBerry. BlackBerry phones are good only for business: hardware keyboards, enterprise level security and fleet management, email, spreadsheets. The dull stuff. If that is good for you, good for you. Interestingly, Blackberry is releasing phones that run Android, so you can take full advantage of Blackberry's security features and Androids top-notch specs.  We like the DTEK60, it offers all the best bits of Android within the secure parameters of Blackberry. It hosts the Blackberry Hub, which is a great productivity app, ideal for both business users and traditional Blackberry fans. Which brings us to the unloved Windows Phone. Unloved, but possibly perfect for small businesses - especially if you use Windows 10, Office 365, Skype, and so on. And while it lacks the app support of Android or iPhone, it still has support for all the big apps. The media story isn't much to write home about, and the phones themselves are far from sexy. But they work. And Windows 10 for mobile offers good compatibility with other Microsoft software, great security features, and the ability for a sys admin to look after a fleet from anywhere.  Windows Phone have obvious downsides. Its OS uptake is trailing behind the others listed and the amount of apps available is embarrassingly small, but with the initial release of Windows 10 for mobile, this could all change. Particularly for business users. When opting for a Windows Phone, a good choice is the Microsoft Lumia 950. Users can purchase a Windows Continuum and connect their phone to a monitor, which will run full Windows without the need for a PC. Pretty cool.  Even better is the HP Elite x3 which offers an exceptional battery life, solid specs and a great user experience, although it will set you back PS700 plus. ",

    "content": "Slow Wi-Fi signal can leave even the calmest person ready to throw their router out the window. Here's why your Wi-Fi signal is slow, plus we explain how to speed up your internet connection and boost your Wi-Fi strength and connectivity.  Whether you're a small business, a startup relying on as home broadband connection or a company with bigger connectivity needs, read on to boost your Wi-Fi connection...  Additional reporting from Sandro Villinger. First you've got to establish the actual speed you're receiving. To do this simply visit a speed testing site, we like Speed Test. From there click begin and it will tell you your upload and download speed. The UK average download speed was around 22.8Mbps last year. The latest Wi-Fi standard is 802.11ac. This standard and the 802.11n are the most desireable for fast connectivity. If your router is either 802.11b or 802.11g standard a new router would definitely boost your Wi-Fi speed and provide a longer range of connectivity. If you've been a loyal customer, most internet providers will send you the newest router for free but others may charge a delivery cost of around PS3-PS6. Here's how to check what Wi-Fi standard you're running on: 1. Click on the Wi-Fi shortcut (usually found on the bottom right of PC screen) 2. Hover your cursor over the broadband service you are using 3. The standard will be listed next to 'Radio Type' The day your router is set up, it automatically detects the least crowded channel and makes that its default. However, with the arrival of new neighbors or offices nearby, the situation may change quickly. All of a sudden, one channel may be used by a handful of routers while others are deserted. There are some great tools that will help determine whether you should change Wi-Fi channel. Software like InSSIDer and NirSoft analyses the entire Wi-Fi spectrum and gives you details about your home network as well as channel usage meaning you can change to a less busy channel. Most internet providers will have step-by-step tutorials on how to do this as procedures can differ. The 2.4GHz frequency is crowded. Not just with neighbors using the same frequency, but also baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens and more. Modern 802.11n and 802.11ac routers offer \"dualband\", which means they're sending two network signals; one at 2.4GHz, and one at 5GHz, which is far less crowded and offers more channels. One drawback is that many device makers only go with the 2.4 GHz receiver. This includes all portable gaming consoles, and also a slew of smartphones. To get a speedy connection activate both networks and connect the mobile devices to the 2.4 GHz network, just enabling the 5GHz network for your laptops and desktops. Sometimes you can't have the luxury of choosing the 5GHz frequency band or selecting a \"lonely\" channel. In such cases, it may be worthwhile to limit your router to sending out signals at intervals of 20MHz. For small businesses with guest Wi-Fi, limit the guest access to 20MHz giving you and your employees a stronger signal with fewer dropouts. An easy, yet often forgotten piece of advice. Make sure that your router's firmware is up-to-date - especially if you've purchased a new one. Expect bandwidth, feature set and resiliency to signals to increase with the first few firmware updates. The latest firmware update can be downloaded from the manufacurer's website and is relatively simple to update as most have a helpful how-to wizard. Sometimes a USB or built in wireless adapter/driver cannot fully communicate with your PC or laptop and updating it could give it the push it needs to get working again. There are a few free tools to make this proccess easier such as Driver Talent which identifies the problem and offers the best downloadable update available for most operating systems. Mac operating systems can find software update solutions on the Apple website. Use a Wi-Fi heatmapping tool to measure the impact of distance, frequency changes and building structures on signal strength. Two tools that are great for this job are NetSpot for Mac and Heatmapper for Windows. Both tools allow you to track Wi-Fi coverage in your office or home. The more points you scan, the more exact your Wi-Fi heatmap. Once you're done, you end up with a map that shows you not just the signal strength but also the throughput of your Wi-Fi network.  Some routers are set up with their \"power savings\" mode on by default. The goal: save a few milliwatts. Unfortunately, this commendable approach reduced bandwidth disproportionately. If you value bandwidth over minimal power savings, check out the router's setting and look for entries called \"Transmission Power\" or various Eco modes. Turn them OFF. Also, do check if your router sports some sort of \"Automatic\" transmission setting. You may want to turn it off and go \"100 percent\" all the time. Unfortunately, the laws of physics sometimes stand in the way of proper wireless bandwidth and signal strength. The distance between your router and the wireless adapter is a more relevant factor than you might think so avoid placing it near thick brick or concrete walls. Placing the router higher up could make a difference to wireless signal. Your Wi-Fi signal can become weak if your PC is too old or too untidy. One way to boost your Wi-Fi speed is to declutter your PC and shed any unnecessary files or programmes that could be slowing it down.  There's plenty of software that claim to speed up your PC and make the general day-to-day running much smoother. We like AVG PC TuneUp, Avast! Cleanup, CCleaner, and F-Secure Booster. For the best tools to clean your PC see: Eight tools that could speed up your PC. If you share your internet connection with people that like to download videos, stream TV shows or play online video games, you might want to consider setting up a few rules. You could suggest that they download content during less popular times. But if you don't fancy any awkward confrontations, there are tools out there that will prioritise apps or programmes. This should result in the most important programmes getting bandwidth priorities.  ",

(GeekWire Photo / Dan DeLong)\n Lulabop, the Seattle-based lifestyle startup which created an \"Invention We Love\" at the 2016 GeekWire Summit with its multi-use carabiner/hook called the Qliplet, announced this week that it has raised $500,000 in a new funding round. Qliplet is also being refocused, and the brand and signature product are now called HEROCLIP. Mina Yoo, the former University of Washington profressor who is CEO and inventor of the HEROCLIP, said in a news release that in order to \"grow from thousands of units per month to millions, we knew we needed more capital resources.\" HEROCLIP's group of Pacific Northwest-based investors, directors and advisors include David Bohan, former CFO and COO of Brooks Running and Filson; Rob Harris, CEO of PMI (maker of Stanley and Aladdin bottles); the SWAN Fund (a seed-stage fund managed by Jim Reed); and Andy Liu, a Seattle entrepreneur. \"HEROCLIP was received extremely well by our early customers, and we had the momentum to become a global brand,\" Yoo said. The product, designed to hold and hang gear for everyone from outdoor enthusiasts to garage reorganziers, can be found in Brookstone stores on on Amazon.com. It's also coming to ACE Hardware stores, where it will be part of an \"Innovative Products Display\" later this year. The infusion of capital will allow HEROCLIP to grow its product line in 2017, adding different sizes and styles, with a price point ranging from $9.95 to $24.95. \"We doubled our Q1 projections and are in the process of rounding out our board of directors,\" Yoo said. \"I couldn't be happier about where things are headed for us.\"  Watch Yoo during her \"Inventions We Love\" presentation at the GeekWire Summit last fall (forward to 17:38 mark):  ",

(Innervate Photo)\n Innervate, a Seattle startup offering a suite of tools to help gaming companies market their products, has raised an undisclosed investment from Trilogy Equity Partners, Founders Co-Op, and angel investor Rudy Gadre. All three investors participated in Innervates's $1.3 million seed round in late 2015. The cash will support Innervate's growth, which is fueled by Gamesight, a new product launched in February. Gamesight helps game companies reach gamers on networks like Twitch and YouTube by making it easier to connect and make deals with influencers on those platforms. Gamers with big fan bases on those streaming sites are often inundated with offers from companies hoping they'll try out a new game. Gamesight helps influencers manage those requests and helps gaming companies track their influencer campaigns. \"That has been doing extremely well, doubling revenue each month,\" Gamesight CEO Adam Lieb said. \"We're 8 full-time people but hiring now for a few roles related to growth. Our team and our investors are encouraged by the unbelievable results we are generating for our customers.\" Lieb is a gaming industry veteran. He built his first online gaming community at age 11 and later sold it to IGN. He went on to found several profitable gaming companies before launching Innervate. Innervate is a graduate of the Techstars Seattle startup accelerator. As of February, the startup had raised $2 million, according to VentureBeat.  Lieb isn't disclosing the amount of cash raised in this round; an SEC filing says that Innervate raised $3.7 million of a $4 million round however, Lieb says that's a combination of new funds, previous money raised, and converted debt.

(SafKan Photo / Yasmin Luqman )\n Earwax build-up is a nasty fact of life for many people, some of whom go to great lengths to clean their ears. Far beyond Q-tips, doctors have reported patients using pens, bobby pins and even construction nails to dig out earwax. (Ouch!) But it turns out all that poking and jabbing makes earwax buildup even worse. That's part of the reason 231,000 people have their ears professionally cleaned every week in the U.S. Now, there may be a new solution next time you drop by the doctor's office: Earwax cleaning headphones. Seattle biomedical engineer Aadil Diwan is regularly one of those people fighting earwax. Like many other Americans, he gets impacted earwax -- a hard buildup of earwax that can cause pain, hearing loss and other problems. It can occur naturally, but it's becoming more and more common as people cram all sorts of things into their ears. So after years of doctors' visits, Diwan thought -- why can't I invent something to make cleaning ears easier and more efficient? He teamed up with his brother  --  tech entrepreneur Sahil Diwan -- and fellow engineering PhD students at the University of Arizona to found SafKan: a Seattle startup developing a device that can clean out a patients' ears automatically in just 35 seconds. Here's how it works. A nozzle on the headphones sprays a mix of warm water and hydrogen peroxide into the patient's ear canal, loosening the earwax and flushing it out. The nozzle also suctions the water and earwax back into the device to avoid messy spills. Based in Seattle, SafKan took home first prize and a $145,000 investment at the Seattle Angel Conference Wednesday. The prize is the first outside funding for the startup, and the beginning of its seed round. Sahil Diwan said the device, called the SafKan Set, is a huge improvement on the current way impacted earwax is treated. Right now the process is very low tech: the patient leans over a bucket while a doctor or nurse uses a giant metal syringe to pump water into their ear until the earwax comes out. It's not only unpleasant and awkward for everyone involved, it's also bad business, Diwan told GeekWire. \"Physicians and providers are actually losing money every single time they do one of these procedures, right now. And it's simply because of labor costs,\" he said. \"With our device, it actually makes it profitable.\" While the SafKan Set is designed to be used for impacted earwax, there's no reason a doctor couldn't use it for more routine ear cleaning, Diwan said.  But, alas, it will only available for doctors and other care providers -- at least for the foreseeable future.  Diwan said the funds from the Angel Conference will help the startup accelerate its manufacturing -- until now, all the prototypes and early models of the device have been made with 3D printers. \"This money will actually help us manufacture our first batch of devices to send out to physicians,\" Diwan said. It will also help the company speed up the FDA clinical trial of SafKan Set, a requirement for low-level devices like this one. Pricing for the device has not been set, but the company is hopeful the earwax-cleaning device will be approved and in beta testing by January 2018. In addition to selling the device to healthcare professionals, SafKan plans to sell packs of the water/hydrogen peroxide mix that go in the device and disposable nozzle tips, creating a recurring revenue model for the company. SafKan was founded in 2016 and currently has 7 employees, many of them the engineers who worked with Aadil Diwan to develop the device. Its headquarters are in Seattle, with some engineers based in Tucson, Arizona. ",

The last day of operation for the company's primary care clinics will be Friday, June 1, according to an employee who spoke to the newspaper anonymously. Qliance CEO Erika Bliss told the PSBJ the company will officially close its doors June 15, two weeks after the clinics shut down. Qliance has not responded to GeekWire's requests for comment. Qliance was originally a well-funded startup, with a total of $33 million raised in 2013. The company's backers included Bezos, venture capitalist Nick Hanauer, Zillow Chairman Rich Barton, comedian and Seattle Sounders owner Drew Carey, Dell founder Michael Dell and others. Last March, the company was bought out by Bliss and president Cheryl Kilodavis. Bliss told GeekWire in an interview three weeks ago that she and Kilodavis wanted to keep the company under their own control, and said they were looking for alternative funding sources to investments. She said they had difficulty finding sources of funding outside the traditional venture capital world. In an internal memo from Bliss obtained by the PSBJ, she said the company was unable to find the funding to last them until they were able to find new contracts. A small team from Qliance will help transition patient needs to other providers over the next month, the memo said. It also said the company will be helping patients with essential services including urgent care and prescription needs. ",

    "content": "Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world, according to the Melanoma Institute Australia. An aggressive form of skin cancer, melanoma kills more young Australians aged 20 to 39 years old than any other single cancer, with stats estimating 1 in 14 men and 1 in 24 women in Australia will be diagnosed with melanoma in their life. With the mantras slip, slop, slap and no hat, no play a constant through childhood, it would be fair to say most young Australians in particular are aware of the dangers of the sun and skin cancer, and may have even looked at a spot on their body before and thought they should get it checked out at some point - actually taking the next step and going to the doctor is another story. Taking that next step is crucial, however: if melanoma is identified at an early stage, simple treatment can result in a complete cure. Looking to make it easier than ever is New Zealand healthtech startup Firstcheck, which has created an app through which users can snap a few pictures of a mole they are concerned about, choose a dermatologist or skin specialist to review their case, and receive feedback within three days. The startup was born at a health-focused Startup Weekend in Wellington in 2015, with the idea coming to cofounder Hayden Laird as his grandfather had just had a melanoma removed and his wife had just had been to a MoleMap clinic, where a patient can have photos of spots taken by nurses and sent to dermatologists for diagnosis. \"I thought what if everyone, not just MoleMap nurses, could send photos to skin specialists for review? There just seemed this huge opportunity to improve access to skin specialists to improve skin cancer outcomes. The missing pieces were the empowering tools needed by people to proactively manage their skin health,\" Laird said. Taking the idea for Firstcheck past the Startup Weekend, Laird, cofounder Frank Lachmann, and the growing team first spent time looking to understand telemedicine, best practice in teledermatology, and the regulatory space governing it all across Australia and Australia. \"The underlying concept may seem relatively simple, connecting patients with local skin specialists for a remote doctor consultation, but in the medical field, nothing is simple, and at times the regulatory environment and industry, complete with its politics, was daunting,\" Laird said. The startup brought on industry advisors including dermatologist Ian Coutts, doctor Tom Mulholland, and health IT and medical advisor Kevin Sheehy to help it navigate the landscape and recruit specialists. \"Being a startup from Taranaki, coming from outside the industry, and being cutting-edge, we had the challenge of finding early adopters in a traditionally conservative industry,\" Laird admitted. \"Then there was the challenge of winning the trust of doctors that have developed a healthy scepticism from all their dealings with pharmaceutical companies. So, there was no room for errors and, in testament to the team, we have had a smooth ride.\" The Firstcheck app works by having a user choose whether they want the dermatologist to review a 'Mole', 'Rash', or 'Other', then guiding them to take a photo, first from 20cm away and again from 10cm away. The app can be paired with a 'SkinScope', a $30 alternative to a dermoscope used by dermatologists, which allows for a magnified image to be taken. Once the pictures are taken, the app asks the user to show on a mannequin where on the body the photos were taken, and detail any additional information that may help the dermatologist, such as how long they have had that mole or rash. The user is then asked to pick a specialist, pay the $19.95 fee, and then wait for their results, where the dermatologist may urge an in-person consultation for further review or advise the patient around what they should keep an eye on. The app can also be used for 'DIY mole mapping', allowing users to take photos of spots and track any new spots or changes. The Firstcheck app and SkinScope launched in New Zealand last November, during Melanoma Awareness Week, and in Australia earlier this year, with the startup having secured NZ$500,000 in funding from angel investors including Catalyst Capital, Angel HQ, and Launch Taranaki. According to Laird, Firstcheck has been adopted by GPs and other health professionals who are using it to submit cases to dermatologists; beyond the $19.95 fee users pay, clinicians are able to set prices between themselves, and as such Firstcheck's fee varies according to this. \"Not every doctor has the same needs, or wants to use Firstcheck in the same way. We have deliberately made the system flexible to accommodate this,\" Laird said. Following its Australian launch, Laird said the startup hit 10,000 app downloads; a few corporates have also made Firstcheck available to employees as part of either their wellness or health and safety programs. A number of health professionals are also recommending to patients the SkinScope to assist with regular checkups between in-person visits, Laird added. Given the prevalence of melanoma and the importance of early detection, there are a couple of others startups working in this space around the world. Amsterdam-founded app SkinVision, for example, has an algorithm analyse a user's photos to calculate different growth patterns of skin tissues to determine the 'potential chaotic growth of pigmented and non-pigmented skin lesions' and then provide a green, yellow, or red risk rating. Scientists at Stanford University also announced earlier this year the results of their diagnosis algorithm for skin cancer; training it to visually diagnose potential cancer through a database of 130,000 images, the algorithm was then tested against 21 board-certified dermatologists. The algorithm matched the performance of dermatologists in its diagnoses of skin lesions, however given it was trained on high-quality medical images rather than smartphone-quality photos, it is not yet ready for consumers. For Laird, however, facilitating diagnosis by an actual professional is key. \"Shortcuts put both the patient and clinician at risk. Firstcheck is the first app of its kind and its network of local skin specialists is unique, as is the very affordable SkinScope,\" he said. \"From the clinician's perspective, with no software setup costs and an affordable dermoscope, teledermatology, with all its benefits, is now accessible to the everyone, and that's something Firstcheck is very proud of.\" ",

    "content": "Wikipedia has waded into Australia's copyright debate, today launching a campaign calling for a fair use copyright exception for Australia. The campaign, which will see banners displayed on Wikipedia to Australians accessing English-language articles on the platform over the next few weeks, is the result of a collaboration between the tech giant, copyright advocacy group Australian Digital Alliance (ADA), and digital rights group Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA). It is looking to highlight a proposal from the Productivity Commission last December that Australia should introduce a fair use exception, the sixth time since 1998 the introduction of fair use has been recommended. \"Australia's current exceptions for fair dealing are too narrow and prescriptive, do not reflect the way people today consume and use content in the digital world, and do not accommodate new legitimate uses of copyright material. Instead of targeting the effect of any potential use on the incentives to create new works, fair dealing is unduly focused on the type or purpose of use,\" the Productivity Commission stated. \"Introducing the principles-based fair use exception as Australia's system of user rights, would go some way to redress the imbalance between copyright holders, consumers and intermediate users.\" With around 10 percent of Wikipedia's five million English-language articles making use of fair use in some way, Jon Lawrence of the EFA said Australians benefit from the exemption every day. \"When you look up the ABC on Wikipedia and see its logo, that logo is there because a Wikipedia editor has uploaded it as a fair use of the image. Wikipedia users can can only upload this content because they are able to rely on the US's fair use provisions. If Wikipedia was based in Australia you wouldn't see that logo,\" he said. The campaign believes fair use is crucial to furthering Australian innovation, stating it would allow Australian companies to, among other things, host cloud computing, undertake web caching and \"other essential business processes\"; enable companies to engage in and create new tech such as data mining and machine learning; and allow local startups and universities to compete on a level playing field with their global peers. Jessica Coates of the ADA said Australia's copyright law is \"absurdly outdated\". \"Forwarding an email. Reposting a meme you found online. Uploading a picture of your toddler mangling the words of a song to Facebook. Our law hasn't caught up with any of these common usages, and as a result Australians inadvertently infringe copyright dozens of times a day,\" she said. \"Schools, universities, libraries, museums, and startups are all hamstrung by current copyright settings. If we want world class education and culture we need our copyright law to enter the 21st century.\" The campaign comes after months of debate around extending copyright safe harbour provisions, which the Productivity Commission had also recommended; legislation on this issue was to be tabled in Parliament earlier this year before being cut. As it stands, current safe harbour provisions ensure ISPs are not held responsible for their customers pirating content online, unless they are aware of such a situation and don't take adequate measures to address it. The government's proposed extension would see safe harbour provisions applied to other providers such as cloud computing services, search engines, and online bulletin boards; with this, a copyright owner would be able to force a service provider to remove infringing content that had been uploaded by its users, with the service provider protected if they complied immediately. Alex McCauley, CEO of startup advocacy body StartupAUS, said copyright safe harbour is \"an essential part of the innovation framework in most developed countries\", pointing to the situation faced by Australian creative marketplace Redbubble. Despite having removed the material as soon as it was notified, the company, based in Australia, is being sued by the Hell's Angels and Pokemon because of images its users had uploaded. ",

    "content": "The stats around diversity in the wider global tech ecosystem are still poor, with stories of bro-focused company cultures rife and reports, such as this analysis of how VCs talk differently about men and women who pitch them, emerging with seemingly depressing regularity. In the face of all this, however, women in the community have been working hard to make it easier for other women to join in. From Girls in Tech to Springboard Enterprises, the homegrown Girl Geek Academy and Like Minded Bitches Drinking Wine, it seems there has never been more support for women looking to launch their own startup. However, Holly Stephens felt there was a gap and decided to fill it with her own group, Triangles. Blending an online forum with networking and educational events, Triangles looks to be more of a results-oriented network that looks beyond just the tech community to also incorporate women in small business, encouraging members to connect and collaborate, and learn from each other. The idea was born out of Stephens' own debates over the years over whether she should stick with the corporate world or venture out into the world with her own business. \"In the back of my mind, I always knew I wasn't really meant for the corporate world; I used to work for Google, the most amazing company in the world, and I loved it, but there was something in the back of my mind saying, I'm not meant to be doing this,\" Stephens explained. Having worked on a couple of side projects before starting at Google, she nevertheless didn't leave the idea of entrepreneurship for long; at Google she worked on a project called the Digital Garage, which aims to train small businesses in digital marketing. After moving to Australia to work on Android Pay for a while, the itch to pursue her own business always there, Stephens decided last December to start looking beyond the tech giant and started doing some freelance digital marketing work for some small businesses. Going over the internal debate she was having, Stephens realised there must be other women having it too. \"I thought, there must be more women out there who feel like I do but aren't as close to or as knowledgeable about the startup world as I am, but if they could be, and could get access to people and know where to start, they could do this too,\" she said. So, Stephens set up a quick landing page for Triangles - \"you don't start building stuff unless you know there's anyone interested,\" she said - and wrote a blog post, and within a day or two she said she had had around 50 people contact her. A little while later she got the domain name and opened it up for sign ups. About a month on, there are around 300 women and men on the Triangles network. The platform incorporates a network-wide feed as well as specific hubs, such as Questions and Groups. Here they can share and find resources such as tools, books, podcasts and other things that may be useful in helping someone get a startup off the ground. Along with the online element will be face to face events, through which Stephens said she wants to \"bring the entrepreneurial spirit into one room\" and really get the results-driven networking going. With the platform free to join, Triangles will be monetised through events. Linking up with partners including Springboard Enterprises Australia and Tank Stream Labs, Stephens is keen to ensure there is always a learning element to events, and as such is developing material for workshops that will take participants through each of the steps that one goes through in starting a business, from how to refine your idea to writing a business plan, finding financing, customer validation, and so on.

    "content": "Even if you're dealing with a leaking nose and burning throat, the most painful part of getting sick is the hour-plus wait often endured at a local general practitioner (GP). Arguably worse than this, however, is the irritation of having everyone else sitting in the waiting room sneezing and coughing in your general direction when you've just popping in for a checkup. Providing every patient in the waiting room something to get their minds off that fact - and perhaps teach people to cover their mouths when they cough - is Medical Channel. Through a specially-installed screen connected to the internet, the startup streams tailored content to both educate and entertain patients slumped in their waiting room chairs. To get the stream up and running in health practices, the business handles the entire end-to-end process, from installing the screens on a no-cost basis to plugging it into Medical Channel's backend streaming system. There's even a cash incentive for practices that install new screens in their health centres. Once online, the startup works beside health care professionals to tailor content relevant to the practice and local community, which may include ensuring that a local health service relevant to patients is being shown. The stream itself runs on a ten minute loop, and is predominantly filled with current news, quizzes, health information, and commercial content. Founder Garry Fahey was applying a similar formula of streaming specially tailored media on screens to cafes and lifts, through another business, Streaming Media, way back in 2001. 2012 would see Fahey pivot the technology to launch Medical Channel, after he identified that the medical space could severely benefit from out-of-home media. After all, despite having phones and a constant internet connection, everyone can relate to the feeling of boredom when sitting in a medical centre waiting room. Medical Channel CEO Naza Musa, however, said it now comes down to more than entertainment. Rather, it's a way for viewers to be educated and make more informed healthcare decisions, whether that be around the services they access, or the products they seek. Using GPs as an example, the stream can also be used to communicate a particular message to patients, including local health notices or professional recommendations for certain products. \"Another area of benefit to the GP is the ability to digitise some of the mandatory posters that they must show. This makes the waiting environment much more professional, clean, and current,\" said Musa. \"Additionally, our content can also be delivered in a multitude of languages to help practices easily and effectively communicate content and practice updates that suits their community.\" Explaining how the screens connect, Musa said it was through a \"sim card media engine\", technology used to help the startup cover data costs and \"simplify\" the installation. The startup will both organise and install screens free of charge, instead earning revenue through paid advertisements inserted into the stream. Advertisements can come from national brands, although Musa said Medical Channel specialises in \"enabling local businesses\" to drive their brands through the platform to their direct target audience. \"Our local sales representatives work to understand the goals and desired outcomes of their relationship with Medical Channel, and so do the designers in order to create an advert they're proud of. Once an advert is live, we stream it 40 to 50 times per day on the screen,\" he said. \"Conversely, national advertisers come through advertising agencies and usually create their own content. Our National Sales Team manage these relationships ongoing throughout the Medical Channel journey.\" This \"engagement content\", as Musa described it, can also often be interacted with through touch-screen functionality of the screens. Any additional content, such as daily news, weather updates and quizzes, is put together by the Medical Channel team and added to the stream. This content is mixed up every 30 minutes, the amount of time Musa said the average Australian spends waiting for an appointment with a health practitioner. \"The Medical Channel loop runs for 10 minutes...so our content is designed to be seen approximately three times per patient and/or loved one,\" he said. The startup sought to raise funding from angel investors in 2015, before moving on to close a $25 million funding round last year led by Sandbar Investments and Melbourne firm Wingate Private Equity. The funding was used to acquire Medical Channel's competitor in the space, The Community Network, a business which offered digital signage solutions to over 1000 venues across Australia, including supermarkets, fitness centres and healthcare facilities. Musa described the acquisition at the time as a \"watershed moment\" for the startup, that would help is extend to more than 50 percent of the addressable market. Earlier last year the startup had also acquired competitor Medical Media, a platform creating interactive content for doctors and other health professionals. Medical Channel currently serves more than 3,200 practices, stating it reaches a national audience of roughly 6.25 million viewers each month. Musa said Medical Channel will continue working to solidify its position as a \"market leader\" in Australia, adding that there are still lots of opportunities within the local GP market. \"We will then look at other opportunities that may include expansion into other health-related areas or networks within Australia, or possibly look at geographic expansion,\" he said.

    "content": "Nothing beats a good night of pub trivia, except maybe testing your knowledge through an app, in your own time, without having to look at your opponent.  So, of course, there's no shortage of trivia apps in the market, but Perth's QuizJam, created by startup Gravy Gaming, is trying its hand by creating a consumer platform and an enterprise platform side by side.  Cofounded by Joel Steel and Glenn Morton, the startup sought to go beyond the consumer market early, creating a QuizJam for Teams platform for organisations.  Steel explained, \"QuizJam for Teams enables an organisation to seamlessly build its own trivia tournaments and gamified surveys within a white-labelled private portal which only its employees can access. Employees are incentivised to play and collect badges, climb the leaderboards and take on their fellow employees to earn in-app currency which they will soon be able to trade for prizes.\"  The platform was first born as QuizAid, with the idea first revolving around working with charities and other not-for-profits to raise awareness and funds for their cause.  However, Steel said after feedback from Apple regarding its donation guidelines, the startup decided to pivot, with a view to coming back to help charities once it's more established and \"can navigate a way around the red tape\".  After putting aside the QuizAid idea, Steel said that for QuizJam for Teams came after lengthy discussions with different organisations. Common themes arose around leaders wanting to find a fun and engaging way to \"connect the dots\" with employees regarding training, learning, and development.  \"Specific research showed us that 70 percent of all training delivered is forgotten the day after being undertaken, meaning that there's a significant amount of work that needs to be addressed in regards to retention and the strategy around it,\" Steel said. An organisation signing up can log onto the customer portal and easily create a trivia tournament or survey, then push it out to employees through in-app notifications or by sending the relevant team a six-digit code they can use to play that specific tournament.  \"Our target market is innovative, forward-thinking organisations with over 100 employees. Ideally they would be geographically spread, as the QuizJam platform can help bring teams together and help improve company culture and team building,\" Steel said.  While the Commonwealth Bank recently completed a trial of QuizJam for Teams, the startup's biggest market so far is the building and construction industry, where QuizJam for Teams is being used to increase engagement and training retention around health and safety, Steel said.  Looking at the QuizJam Classic, or consumer, product, after downloading the app a user can sign on and start competing in global tournaments, answering blocks of questions at their own pace. Points are awarded for speed and accuracy, with players receiving badges for various achievements.  Players can buy 'assists' - getting another go at a question they got wrong, getting an extra three seconds on the clock to answer a question, or getting a 50/50 shot at an answer.  According to Steel, the app has amassed 28,000 users and 38,000 questions so far. Brands able to create or sponsor specific tournaments, with the likes of the West Coast Eagles looking at tournaments as a way to boost fan engagement.   \n\nTo further its growth, QuizJam joined the Plus Eight accelerator in Perth after meeting its entrepreneur in residence, Tim Brewer in San Francisco a few months ago.  \"We have already got so much out of the accelerator, including an increased level of focus as being surrounded by like-minded people who are all striving to go 10 percent faster every week can only bring positive outcomes. We've also been introduced to world-class mentors and education programs which we would never get access to in Perth, or Australia for that matter,\" Steel said. The startup recently brought on Gary Walker, cofounder of Fetch TV, as non-executive director. It also last month partnered with the Australian arm of global IQ society Mensa to create a 'Mensa vs the World' tournament.  Geoff Russell, Australian Recruiting Officer at Mensa, said the QuizJam platform allows the organisation to both fulfil key criteria and encourage high-level thinking among thousands of \"undiscovered intellectuals\".   \"The public can measure themselves and be encouraged to push their minds. It's a win-win,\" Russell said. \"We have high hopes that the QuizJam model can reach out and stimulate the minds of thousands of people who would otherwise not consider joining Mensa. There are vast numbers of people who have no idea how good they are, or could be.\" There's no shortage of trivia apps out there, or even survey or employee training and engagement platforms for organisations, however Steel believes \"no one is doing what we are doing and offering the ease of implementation, gamification and minimal barriers to entry like we do\". Having raised $900,000 in funding to date, the startup is looking to raise a further $1.2 million to put its whole focus into growing the QuizJam for Teams business. Its goal, Steel said, is to reach $1 million in annual recurring revenue by the end of the 2017/18 financial year. \n ",

    "content": "If you've ever gotten lost navigating a shopping centre or city street before, chances are you've shaken your fist and placed all the blame on the abysmal signage that was attempting to guide you (damn straight, it was never your fault). While it's natural to place the blame on said shopping centre or government, there are more often than not additional culprits behind these designs, the elusive 'wayfinding' professionals. Essentially, these are design consultants with an expertise in wayfinding, the art of placing information systems in physical spaces to help guide people around. Typically working within design firms, these experts are hired to design the layout of signs around a space, the very signs we're too blind to follow. Providing an integrated way for wayfinding consultants and facilities to plan, collaborate, and ultimately develop effective signage is Sydney startup Pam. Through a desktop and app-based platform of the same name, Pam is at heart a sign management application, specialised for design companies creating sign layouts for clients, as well as large customers such as hospitals, airports, and universities developing their own sign layouts. Pam's Marketing Director, Anthony Coundouris, provided insight into the 'traditional' solutions used to develop sign layouts. If you're thinking jumbled spreadsheets, image flow galleries and scrawled notes, Coundouris said you would be right. He split the entire process into four categories - planning, design, installation, and maintenance. Most existing processes or platforms out there governing one of these areas, Coundouris said, often addresses them in isolation, rather than integrated in one solution. This means planning work is done on one software, design on another software, and so on. \"There are normally multiple stakeholders working on this, from design fabricators, to the actual organisation, and its various employees,\" Coundouris explained. \"Most of the applications only handle one component of wayfinding called the signage lifecycle. Existing applications only cover one of them, however, we combine them into one application, removing the necessity to have lots of applications.\" Initially the startup began as a project exclusively for the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). At the time, Coundouris said there was a \"smaller version\" of the product available, designed predominantly to help the university, rather than design firms and their wayfinding experts. UTS was, at this point, in the midst of implementing its $1 billion-plus City Campus Master Plan, which would see the entire campus overhauled with a design and infrastructure update. With that also came the need for a new, extensive signage system, and so the startup helped the university roll out 8,000 signs across 19 buildings with its Pam technology. Although Pam was only being trialled at UTS, other organisations began hearing about the platform, opening the possibility to expand Pam to other commercial clients, including design firms. \"That's how the commercial reality of Pam Wayfinding was born, and that's when it ceased to be part of a design company and became a stand alone application as its own business,\" explained Coundouris. Now, the startup has five large clients, including a few other universities and Toronto Pearson Airport in Canada.\nSpeaking to how the airport client would use the platform, Coundouris said to imagine the troubles airports face keeping their thousands of signs up to date: airports undergo structural changes, airlines move and swap docking and check-in spaces, shops open and close, and new facilities like toilets pop up each year. To begin a project on the platform, a project manager or administrator can sign on and then invite other users, such as wayfinding consultants and design fabricators, to join the platform. The manager then uploads a floor plan, which is then overlaid on a Google Maps interface. Project workers will then take photos of the existing sign layout, upload them to the platform, then place them as labelled \"pins\" on the map interface. Coundouris said this is to help visualise the entire signage layout, and work out from this point what needs to be replaced and where it's located. Like a flowchart, he added that project workers can actually see \"the experience the user will have when following the signs\", by looking at this interface. New signs are planned off this data by wayfinding experts, while those in charge of installing the signs use it as a map for what goes where. \"You go to the application, look at the overview, and think, what can I do with them, what do I replace, what do I move, and what are the costs involved? The more you spend on the application planning, the more you'll get out of Pam,\" said Coundouris. Access is currently sold on a 'pay by total sign' basis, where customers purchase packages tailored to how many signs they'll be managing in their area. Identifying the commercial potential for Pam in the US, Coundouris said the startup is now examining funding opportunities to help expand overseas. Recently, the startup travelled to the US as part of the KPMG's elevate61 accelerator program, one of the six startups accepted. \"The biggest opportunity for will be in the US, since that's where most kinds of these facilities exist. What we've been trying to do is look at how we can expand and set up offices in the US, and fund expansion in that side of the world,\" said Coundouris. ",

    "content": "Sinorbis, a startup developing a cloud marketing platform to help brands develops and market Western content for Chinese audiences, has announced it has raised $2.3 million to accelerate the launch of its digital solution. Sinorbis first began as a consulting agency helping businesses bridge the gap between the Chinese and Western markets. The consulting arm works beside clients to help them understand how to translate their product to appeal to a Chinese audience, providing insight beyond the simple translation of language. Looking to expand its reach, the startup is bringing the service online for marketing agencies through a cloud platform. The $2.3 million in funding will help fuel the launch of the online solution, which will become available to marketing agencies to help them assist their clients in breaking into the Chinese market. Speaking to Startup Daily late last year, Sinorbis founder Nicolas Chu said the business had begun the funding round as a way to expand its expertise to new clients and \"eventually branch further internationally\". The business had already acquired a number of global brands through its consulting arm, including LG and Philips, while locally serving the University of Western Sydney, University of Technology Sydney, and REA Group. \"Knowing that we already have clients puts us in a very comfortable position where we know we're developing something that will definitely be used,\" Chu had said. The round was led by digital communications firm Executive Channel Holdings (ECH), which recently sold its Australian office display network to oOh! Media for $68.5 million. Bringing the startup's total raise to $3.9 million to date, Chu said it marks an important step in allowing Sinorbis to help Western businesses tackle the giant Chinese market. \"The digital marketing spend in China from Western companies already sits at US$4.7 (AU$6.3) billion, however, much of this is misdirected or simply lost in translation. Our technology will help better target this spend and be the catalyst to grow this market to nearly US$30 (AU$ 40.5) billion annually in the next decade,\" he said. Discussing the variations between the Chinese and Western markets, Chu said the differences are particularly distinct in the online space, largely due to China's strict regulation policies. \"You don't have Google, you have Baidu and 360. You don't have Facebook or Twitter, you have WeChat,\" explained Chu. \"[Also] no Google means no Google Analytics, so you can't even properly understand SEO or how campaigns are running without re-learning the Chinese search engine Baidu. Chu and cofounder Allen Qu developed their intricate knowledge over time working for a number of international companies who dealt with the Chinese market. Chu said he translated that knowledge to Sinorbis, with the startup's technology offering digital strategies, SEO, and web development protocols tailored for Chinese markets. \"Australian companies have traditionally struggled to market their goods directly to Chinese digital consumers, relying on intermediaries such as Daigous and local Chinese agencies to do the work for them,\" Chu said. \"With our new platform, Australian companies and their marketing agencies will be able to directly market to Chinese digital consumers, much like they're already able to do in the West.\" With the funding, the startup has appointed a number of new advisors to its board, including ECH's global CEO Charles Parry-Okeden and Amazon Web Services's Head of Startup Ecosystem, Ian Gardiner.

    "content": "KPMG Australia's new High Growth Ventures practice has announced a strategic alliance with Taronga Ventures, focused on developing opportunities for Taronga's RealTech Venture Fund. With Savills in 2016 estimating the combined value of the global real estate sector to be US$217 trillion, Taronga Ventures was founded last year by Jonathan Hannam, formerly head of capital at developer Mirvac, and Avi Naidu, founder of Aura Funds Management, to focus on tech developments in the sector. The $50 million RealTech Venture Fund will be the first in Australia to centre on startups in the real estate and built environment sectors, looking at the different stages of the real estate 'life cycle', from planning and financing to design and construction, sale and development, leasing and management, and sustainability. Under the partnership, KPMG's High Growth Ventures practice will work with Taronga Ventures to develop and run programs including an accelerator for early stage startups in the space, as well as events connecting startups to industry and investors. Amanda Price, head of High Growth Ventures, said real estate is \"at the cusp of a tech-driven revolution\" and Australian startups can help lead the charge across the Asia-Pacific region. \"We have founders who understand the space, we have innovative technologies, and we have an extremely sophisticated built environment sector due to the institutional nature of our [Real Estate Investment Trust] market,\" she said. \"Much in the way that Australian emerged as a regional fintech leader thanks to building a community; this alliance is the first step in building a globally relevant Australian realtech sector.\" Naidu said Taronga Ventures expects to see huge model shifts in commercial, retail, and accommodation as digital technologies change the way people live. \"While investment into innovation in the real estate sector has been slow compared to sectors like financial services, this is quickly changing. Many of the largest owners of real estate have realised that in order to ensure long term returns for their portfolios they need to act now to ensure these assets remain relevant to changing consumer demand,\" he said. As part of the partnership, Price will also join the Advisory Council for the RealTech Venture Fund, joining others including Kerry Chikarovsky, former leader of the NSW Liberal Party, and Melanie Wills, former Chief Investment Officer at the NRMA. The partnership comes just a few months after KPMG Australia announced the launch of the High Growth Ventures practice, which Price told Startup Daily at the time had been established to address the core needs of startups gearing up for growth, and \"bring the rigour, expertise, and connections\" of a global professional services firm to help them with acceleration. With KPMG's internal structure set up to work with bigger companies, Price said that while staff were keen to work with startups, they didn't quite know how to best do so. Price's solution was a new division within KPMG that will work to sell what she calls \"business design\" to startups; that is, helping startups design their businesses from the beginning to give them the core foundations for fast growth, looking at the likes of business structure, IP, financial literacy, patents, and so on, with these priced according to the startup's size. \"They're all those things that we in here do normally, but we've productised that and priced accordingly for these entrepreneurs,\" she said.

Set to operate 24 hours a day, UBank said the AI was trained on data collected from customer questions that were submitted on the existing LiveChat and, of course, will continue to learn as more customers engage with it and ask begin to ask unlisted questions. There's also a touch of humour in-built in the assistant, with the example \"How much does a hipster weigh?\" and the response \"An Instagram\" provided by UBank (we're hoping though that over time the AI will also cultivate a better sense of humour too) . Jokes aside, CEO of UBank CEO Lee Hatton said the new technology will help simplify the often laborious process of applying for a home loan, while speeding things up for customers - so much so that you can complete the process faster than you can eat breakfast. \"If you've gathered all of your paperwork, the form can be completed in as little time as it takes you to have your breakfast. And, securing one of the most competitive rates in the market could help a customer save thousands of dollars in interest over the life of a loan,\" she said. Operating under NAB, UBank was launched in 2008 as an exclusive online and over the phone banking service, its digital focus set with the aim of trying to simplify banking processes. With the introduction of RoboChat now streamlining much of the home loan process, UBank was keen to assure that the AI assistant won't be snatching away employee jobs anytime soon (no Skynet, yet), with the company's current customer service team set to stay on board. Rather, RoboChat will join the current live chat function offered on the platform, with customers able to access either option based on their needs. \"UBank will still have experienced staff on hand to chat on the phone, via email and our live online chat offering; RoboChat will provide an added option for those needing quick online responses or those that are close to finalising the form,\" Hatton said. AI assistants in the home loan process are on their way to becoming a new fad, with Aussie startup Online Home Loans looking to enter the market with their own AI, Sophie. The assistant, also built on IBM Watson, holds similar machine learning capabilities to RoboChat. However, Sophie was developed with the purpose of helping homeowners identify what type of loan they're qualified for, with the startup looking to 'train' the AI to the point of being able to guide customers through the entire application process. According to IBM Asia Pacific Vice President Brock Douglas, there is indeed a growing trend amongst virtual assistants. Douglas stated that this year alone, IBM Watson's series of API's will engage \"more than a billion people, across 20 industries.\" \"From deepening the customer experience, to increased productivity for employees, virtual assistants are being adopted across industries and becoming more advanced in natural conversation and emotional intelligence, with the help of cognitive technology,\" he said. \"UBank's work with IBM Watson is a powerful example of how organisations are leveraging cognitive virtual assistants that have the ability to engage in a conversation, ask questions, learn and respond in context, as opposed to providing stock responses.\" ",

    "content": "When people generalise that 'everything is done online these days', they're clearly forgetting that the internet doesn't teach people to drive, although surely between online tutorials and VR games it does try. Australian law requires there to be another person teaching us before we're unleashed on the road alone, a person that is brave and willing to put their life on the line while we try and figure out how the hell to reverse park. There are an estimated 10,000 plus driving instructors expected to teach learner drivers this year, a number which seems microscopic compared to other industries. In reality, however, driving instructors find themselves in a highly competitive industry, one that still operates predominantly on word-of-mouth recommendations and locality. Queensland startup No Yelling is looking to take driving instructors and their students digital, through an app that allows learner drivers to connect with instructors, book appointments and complete transactions. For Jasper Boyschau and James Gemmell, No Yelling's founders, developing the platform meant helping to bring visibility to workers within an \"established industry\". While there are a few big franchise names in the industry, as Boyschau explained, it is for the most part a space where, more often not, each driving instructor helms their own driving school or business, meaning each self-employed instructor is tasked with competing against, well, just about every other instructor in their local area. The idea for No Yelling came to Boyschau quite early on in his career, roughly seven years ago when he was 20 years old. Looking into what industries were ripe for digital disruption, Boyschau noticed a large opportunity within the driving school space, which is largely untouched by any digital solutions. While a small portion made the shift to social media advertising and websites, many instructors were still gaining clients through old-school methods. \"We were chatting to some of our friends that were trying to learn at the time and looked at some of the websites for these driving schools. We found they were stuck back in the Yellow Pages era,\" said Boyschau. Looking to test the waters, the cofounders took a small seed funding investment and built a \"basic\" website for booking lessons. Fulfilling their predictions, the response received for the platform was strong. \"We realised there was a pretty good market for it, and we just needed to develop a system around it to facilitate a connection, make it simple to use and automate it. The real meat of the idea is what we've deemed 'redistributing the administration' of the business. Rather than the teacher doing the work, we'd handle a lot of the administration for them,\" explained Boyschau. Building out the online platform, the startup also developed an app and adopted the name 'No Yelling', a nod to the \"learner drivers who get yelled at out on the road\" (which essentially refers to all of them). The startup also integrated a native application for payments into the platform, as a way to automate the \"accounting\" side and tend to the tedium driving school owners face when managing payments from multiple clients each day. No Yelling facilities the entire transaction process for both sides of the marketplace, with the startup taking an 18 percent cut from each instructor's fee. \"The money is essentially held by No Yelling and delivered once the lesson is successfully completed. We have a money-back guarantee for lessons,\" said Boyschau. Boyschau added that most instructors joining the platform already helm their own existing driving schools, however, each are vetted regardless to ensure they have the experience and credentials. \"With digital technology it's becoming harder and harder for small businesses to advertise. So once they hear about our brand, they're drawn to the platform. Once we've got a few in board in an area, they all just start talking and find out that No Yelling is a way to connect them with clients.\" Once on board, instructors are able to dictate their own pricing, hours, and locations, as well as choose which clients to accept and book based on who is \"assigned\" to them; however, rather than booking a lesson through the app itself, at this stage an instructor will get in contact with the learner via phone to book a lesson and schedule it on the app. Having \"assigned\" clients means learner drivers aren't able to choose an instructor, beyond selecting their preferred gender and time for a lesson. They'll simply be matched to an instructor in their local area. Boyschau said this was developed as a way to distribute work evenly, thus balancing the marketplace for all the instructors and prevent \"conflict\". \"We don't want to create too much conflict or competition between our driving team, since we want our drivers to work as a team. [Nor] do we want to overcomplicate the process for users,\" he explained. Not everything about No Yelling, however, can be automated and digital - a learner's logbooks still need to be filled out manually according to the government's system, an \"archaic\" system which No Yelling will look to lobby to change. Alongside the No Yelling marketplace, the startup has also developed a 'Learner's Practice Test' app designed to help prepare users for that gruelling touch-screen test learner driver test. This test, in addition to No Yelling, is currently only available to Queenslanders, although Boyschau said the business is planning to expand to Melbourne and has its eyes on Sydney too. ",

    "content": "Vancouver-founded, San Francisco-based payments startup Hyperwallet has expanded into Australia, looking to target growth across the Asia Pacific region from its new Sydney base. It will also have a number of staff on the ground in Melbourne. The company operates a global payout system, effectively allowing companies to easily pay out employees, contractors, or service providers in their local currency. With the gig economy a strong market for Hyperwallet, Australia and the wider APAC region are ripe for growth. The Australian office will be headed up by managing director and senior vice president of APAC, Simon Banks, a former PayPal executive. Appointed in March, Banks said the region is punching above its weight when it comes to creating innovative two-sided marketplaces. \"Hyperwallet is an ideal global fintech partner for these organizations; our APIs are capable of unlocking a fast, secure, and compliant supply-side payment network for marketplaces of all shapes and sizes. That's something I'm very excited to share,\" he said. Founded by Canadian Lisa Shields in 2000, Hyperwallet has come a long way over the last 17 years. In Sydney to explore the local fintech and retail scene last week, Hyperwallet's chief commercial officer Peter Burridge said the company spent a solid 10 years trying to find its identity, going through a number of different iterations before finding its niche. For a time, it focused on facilitating payments between consumers, allowing them to pay one another into different bank accounts as at that time Canadian banks didn't offer such a service themselves. \"That didn't really drive anything in terms of sustainability for the business, however, but what happened is along the way is we discovered the industry called multi-level marketing,\" Burridge explained. Dubbing them \"the gig economy 1.0\", Burridge said the growth of brands such as Avon, Mary Kay, Herbalife presented a significant opportunity. These businesses, the majority of which are headquartered in the US, are global, with hundreds of thousands of people selling their wares around the world each month. Growing globally meant having to set up structures around the world in order to pay all of these people for their work, in their own local currency. \"This creates a huge amount of friction and admin in their business, just managing that scale, because these businesses scale really quickly. Herbalife, one of our clients, has millions of payees around the world,\" Burridge said. \"They look a lot like the gig economy companies, where some people create an app, turn it on, and now they've got to pay people in 100 countries.\" The company didn't want to be a pure foreign exchange business, Burridge explained, but rather give its clients access to local payments infrastructure in different countries. This is done by Hyperwallet opening up bank accounts in the Hyperwallet name in each country, allowing clients to pay an amount into their local account; the Hyperwallet bank account in the payee's home country then pays out the corresponding amount in the other currency, with the payee able to get the money paid out into their bank account, their mobile wallet, a pre-paid Visa card, or in cash thanks to the company's partnerships with the likes of Western Union and MoneyGram. With Hyperwallet stating it has more than 400 global enterprise, ecommerce, and on-demand platforms on its books, among them Expedia, Marketplacer, and Herbalife, Burridge said the company is excited about the opportunities Australia holds, and helping Australian companies go global. \"You've got some of the world's biggest gig economy businesses, the Envatos and Freelancers, who have gone global the hard way,\" he said. \"We look at those guys, and we think, we don't want the next Envato or Freelancer to have to go through the pain the others did for five to 10 years of building a global network to pay everybody; we want them to just plug into us and be global.\" Australia is also the perfect place for the company's APAC base because of its \"transparent, Western-type banking system\" and vibrant fintech market.

    "content": "Logistics management startup Shippit, whose platform allows clients to book carriers, track deliveries, and notify customers, has announced the closing of a $2.2 million Series A funding round led by Aura Group, with the company looking to leverage the investor's expertise and networks in the Asia Pacific region to expand. With participation from Addventure Fund and RTL Group Investment in the round, the fresh funding brings the total raised by the startup since it launched in 2015 to $3 million. Providing clients with  It will go towards expanding Shippit's engineering team, as well as its sales and marketing efforts. Joint CEO Rob Hango-Zada, who cofounded Shippit with William On, said the startup had originally set out to raise $3 million. \"We were on quite a good trajectory and the financials were trending quite positively; we had enough money to last us out until the end of the year, but as a leadership team we made the decision that the time was right for our business,\" he said. \"We had seen validation in that product/market fit stage, and since there's now a bit of an arms race going on in the logistics space, a capital raise was all about getting that discretionary spend into the business at a good time for the business, so we can then invest in people and the product and accelerate our growth plans.\" According to Hango-Zada, the startup attracted enough interest to secure $5 million, however with the business tracking better than they had projected as they went through the raising process, he and On made the decision to not only leave the $5 million on the table, but also scale back their original ask. It's an interesting approach, with mainstream startup culture promoting the idea of raising, even if it isn't exactly needed - Canva announced its latest US$15 million raise last year saying it had not yet touched the US$15 million it had raised the year before, while SafetyCulture too stated earlier this year it hadn't started spending the $30 million it raised last October. \"Never raise more than you need is one of the key principles of our business, and we kind of looked at it like a Formula 1 Grand Prix: as you're doing laps you know when to go to the pit stop and refuel, and it's very critical you don't do it too soon and you don't do it too late,\" Hango-Zada explained. \"From the time we made the decision to raise to the time we took the money in, our business growth actually exceeded our expectations and we doubled the business in that time, which meant the capital requirement wasn't actually as significant as it was initially.\" The startup reported it grew its subscriber base by over 40 percent through the raising process, seeing an increase of around 200 percent in monthly revenue. Hango-Zada attributed this growth to a mix of word of mouth and retailers realising they need to get their logistics right to improve their customer experience, \"particularly with all the murmurs about Amazon in the market\". With investors interested, Hango-Zada said the team sought to find those they could lean on for their business expertise, with Aura Group suited for its focus on Asia. \"William and I aren't the sharpest tools in the shed; we rely on other people to be our brains trust, so we were quite lucky to be able to handpick our investor set,\" he said. Running a collection of financial services businesses, Aura Group last year announced it would be launching a $30 million venture capital fund to target growth and expansion-stage startups. Having already invested in Catapult Sports and Freedom Insurance, Aura Group announced it had reached its first close for the fund in February, raising $10 million; it is aiming for a final close in February 2018. For Shippit, Asia and the Middle East are both markets ripe for growth, as logistics is \"not necessarily a seamless experience\" in either. \"Consumer demand for ecommerce is outstripping the ability of logistics to deliver, and that's why Aura presents such an exciting opportunity for us,\" Hango-Zada said. The startup also has existing clients across Australia and New Zealand who are now themselves looking to operate in Asia, providing a \"compelling point\" for Shippit to look towards expansion. ",

SEE ALSO: There's literally a startup accelerator at the Vatican now These companies mean well enough, but they are trying to solve problems that don't necessarily need fixing. Here's a recent batch of startup ridiculousness. proud to announce my new tech startup, Groodlur, which takes unnecessary tech startups and converts them into uh, I guess, shoes -- uaWssnS ttaW (@suss2hyphens) April 19, 2017 Instead of buying bottled water, this company wants you to join their water station service. Reefill offers New York City tap water at various locations around the city for anyone who pays the $1.99 monthly subscription fee. The app is free, but that delicious city water is for members only. Yes, this sounds good for cutting back on environmental waste, but what happened to just asking a restaurant for a glass of tap water?  Juicero got shot down hard when everyone realized they could open the startup's juice packs by hand instead of with the company's $400 \"smart home\" contraption. The company ultimately offered refunds for their expensive and totally unnecessary juice press. When you need Gucci, you need it now. That's where startup Farfetch comes in to deliver Gucci clothes and accessories within 90 minutes. Your order is filled and brought straight to your door from Gucci stores in New York, LA, Miami, Europe, Brazil and Japan. If you live in a participating city your designer needs will be taken care of ASAP. Fashion can't wait. The Plenty Pen is as low-tech as it comes despite its marketing as a \"super-functional pen\" laden with features. Instead of carrying a separate pen, pencil, eraser (which usually comes on the back of a pencil anyway) and touchscreen stylus, this contraption put them all in one. Convenient, maybe. Necessary? Not really, unless you tend to buy a lot of things out of airplane catalogues. It's just combining a bunch of things without innovating much. Like two-in-one shampoo and conditioner, it's just not that difficult to keep things on their own sometimes.  Just what you needed to write. Image:  plenty pen The Grovio does seem like a useful way to take care of your succulent when you go on a business trip. But whatever happened to asking your neighbor to water your plants? Instead this smart watering station has sensors to monitor the moisture, humidity, and temperature for your house plant. It's wireless, automatic, and can take care of up to three plants at a time for as long as 45 days (that's a really long business trip). It's cool that the future is here, but we don't need this quite yet. At least until neighbors still exist.  House plants get the robot treatment. Image:  grovio This is a video dating app that takes an old school concept and blends it with new technology. But why? The classic party game, spin the bottle, doesn't need a revamp. It's not exactly the most romantic way to meet someone IRL, so doing it online sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. And let's not even talk about what Chatroulette became known for...   Online dating meets old-school party games. Image:  Spin the bottle If you don't have a Smalt -- that's a salt shaker with Bluetooth technology -- you're doing it wrong. How else can you entertain and have dinner parties unless your salt shaker plays music, lights up, and serves as a centerpiece.  Finally, we can't forget about the biggest startup fail in recent history: entertainer Ja Rule and entrepreneur Billy McFarland's Fyre Festival. But instead of a luxury, Instagram-worthy music event filled with models, influencers, and pristine beaches, the inaugural Fyre Festival was a mess.  The company's pitch deck should have been the first clue that this was bound to be a disaster, but it's easy to get caught up in a startup's compelling language. \"It will ignite that type of emotion, that type of power in our guests,\" that's a real line from a presentation slide to get investors to buy-in on this Caribbean dream weekend.  Anything that's driven almost entirely by social media influencers is probably highly unnecessary. But Fyre Festival plowed ahead, and everyone got to watch the it burn spectacularly.   ",

    "content": "A few days ago, Prague hosted the Innovative Legal Services Forum which focused also on LegalTech startups and clever use of technology by legal firms. Legal innovators discussed topics such as Big Data, Outsourcing, Law Firm Business Model & Compensation. We interviewed Aron Solomon who aims to improve the legal industry, having built Law Made and LegalX. Law Made is an advisory firm focused on the legal space with a particular emphasis on supporting entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship across the globe. Aron won the prestigious Fastcase 50 in 2015, which highlights people who have charted a new course for the delivery of legal services. What can technology do to help lawyers be more liked by people?  Absolutely nothing. I know many truly lovely people who are lawyers, but technology won't change the perception that has existed in our culture from the time of Shakespeare and beyond and is and was created by really shitty practitioners. What has been done so far by legaltech? While it is still early days for legal technology, its disrupting an entire industry. Legaltech is ten years behind where the industry I grew up in as an entrepreneur - education technology - is. And they're going to follow very similar paths. Perhaps most importantly, legaltech is now part of an industry-wide conversation. It's in the minds, mouths, and, increasingly, hearts of many. What is next to be disrupted? The in-between spaces. Focus not on building something to compete with LegalZoom but rather something that can integrate existing technologies. I also personally have a very positive long view on technologies in legal that aren't necessarily \"legaltech,\" such as those that bring legal on to the Blockchain. And, yes, AI will continue to be important but entrepreneurs will need to be more proactive and creative in how they use AI in legal. Can you name us some legaltech startups you find interesting and promising? There are several Law Made startups from around the world that have done very well so far in Europe. I would point to Beagle (Beagle.ai) a contract analysis software, that has significant business from the EU and around the world. We also work with a growing number of startups from Europe and the United Kingdom, and they are doing very well here. I would point to Pekama, out of Cambridge, England, as a company gaining really nice traction here. Should entrepreneurs go to the Silicon Valley to start new business or will they be fine in Europe? Please, please stay. It's the rare exception that one should immediately go somewhere like Silicon Valley. Build your startup here in Europe and we at Law Made, which is a truly global business, will be here to help. Then, when it's time to scale up, maybe (or maybe not) Silicon Valley, or London, or New York makes sense. Be smart, build your team here, work closely together (including with you developers, who you can actually afford to hire here), be super good with your money so you can extend your runway, and the sky will be your limit. You are actually capable of doing great things in Europe, and that most definitely includes the CEE. Looking at different hubs in Europe and globally, which cities would you say are leading the way in LegalTech and why? Definitely what we've helped build here in Toronto, Toronto punches way above its weight in legal innovation. We at Law Made helped build the foundation for startups to succeed in Toronto, just as we will in various parts of Europe. London is absolutely an important hub, not just because of the Magic Circle firms but because of the rising culture of innovation and support for entrepreneurs in London. Their UK Seed Investment Scheme, which I recently wrote about, is really a pretty amazing program - definitely one of the better ones I've ever seen. Globally, New York will be very important in legal, as will Beijing, where startups can grow and scale very quickly. I have been to China 56 times, have lived in Beijing and help run a startup accelerator there. I soon hope to be able to include European legal startups in the Chinese innovation scene. As for Europe itself, it's an open playing field and my formula is simple: Legal startups will build and grow in places where founders can afford to live a decent quality of life; it is easy to travel to major centers of law and commerce; there is a strong talent pool there or close by at an affordable price (especially development talent); and corporates, universities and local and regional governments not only like having innovators there, they are proactive in developing programs to attract and retain them. I'm big on Germany and the Netherlands, and I have a very positive long view on CEE. Who is Aron? What makes you get up from bed? My gross pudel! She and I wake up really early and she retrieves in the lake and swims with the ducks. Even in the winter. We are usually awake by 0400. I love getting up in the morning. And I love espresso but take only 1-2 cups a day and never in the morning. Just when I need inspiration. What is Law Made? We make law better. At Law Made, we basically help bring all the pieces of the industry together, from startups, to huge corporations, law firms. We are always founder-friendly, and focused on those who make things. As we say, we get the Digital Davids to play with the Enterprise Goliaths. ",

This is Spotify's fourth acquisition this year. Niland's technology will enable Spotify to deliver better song recommendations to users. Founded in 2013, Niland develops machine learning algorithms to analyze digital music. Niland graduated the Paris-based accelerator program Agoranov and raised an undisclosed amount of funding from French investor IT Translation. Prior to Spotify's purchase, Niland offered music search and recommendation services to companies in the music business through custom APIs. The young company also offered content creators and publishers a specialized audio search engine. Customers were able to upload tracks for processing and receive a list of similar sounding songs. The technology could also be used to surface similar tracks within a particular catalog, making for a powerful recommendation engine. Niland's technology is able to extract complex metadata pertaining to mood, type of voice, instrumentation, genre and tempo. Niland's team and technology will now become part of the Spotify R&D unit based in New York City, where it will help the streaming giant improve its recommendation and personalization technologies.

    "content": "Chatbots and the artificial intelligence technology that enables them are on the rise and constantly evolving. Described by many as the next industrial revolution, chatbots are capable of providing benefits to a large amount of businesses by helping them (for example) to improve and automate their communication with existing or potential clients. Taking this into account, Smartly.ai built an artificial intelligence platform that allows users to create chatbots and voice interfaces for connected devices, allowing them to combine smart conversations with a visual editor. Chatbots developed on Smartly.ai can be deployed with all the most widely-used messaging apps, including SMS, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Slack et al, and also with voice command platforms such as Alexa, Cortana and Siri. As artificial intelligence starts to transform our world, Smartly's goal is to ensure that businesses and developers are provided with the essential tools they need to harness the power of AI to change daily life and release its full potential.  We talked with Hicham Tahiri, the CEO of Smartly.ai, who was recently awarded the title \"Alexa Champion\" thanks to his knowledge and passion for Amazon Alexa, in addition to his motivation to educate and inspire other developers in the community. Here is the interview: What was the motivation for starting Smartly and what was the problem you wanted to solve? We had observed the huge potential of voice interfaces, for example, an estimated 1.8 billion people will be using a vocal interface by 2021! However, previously something was missing to help developers truly unlock the potential of voice applications. The process of creating an application can be quite tricky. You need to master several technical components (voice recognition, natural language understanding, dialog management and text to speech) and have good notion of voice user interface ergonomics. This meant that app builders spent most of their time solving the integration issues instead of building high value apps. We wanted this to change, so we created Smartly.AI, the ultimate toolkit for building voice and text based apps. Our Saas platform was founded with the ambition of widening the access to voice and chat interfaces and introducing conversational intelligence into daily lives of everyone. Since the early beginnings of Smartly in 2012 a lot has changed and AI has become a trend topic. How are you working with with Alexa and others vocal assistants?  When Alexa was launched, its openness was a developer's dream. The Smartly.AI team set to work on creating Alexa Designer, a developer toolbox that offered a visual conversation design tool with automatic code generation and a community-generated intents library, plus a voice simulator, meaning users could speak to the skill directly in the browser without requiring an Echo. Following the arrival of more and more vocal assistants, Smartly AI broadened its scope to incorporate more and more voice (and chat) platforms. Today we support all major platforms including Alexa, Google Home, Cortana, Siri, Facebook, Slack, SMS and more. Plus our API means that you can easily integrate your app with all connected objects. What makes Smartly AI stand out from competing solutions for conversational artificial intelligence? Smartly AI offers the most complete solution on the market for developers and companies wanting to create voice applications and intelligent chatbots. From our highly user friendly visual conversation design tool and detailed analytics to our innovative help center and smart bot memory features. Furthermore, our platform does not require any previous developer experience! For example, a users could create a vocal app for a sports media that relays the latest results, prognostics and comments via Siri, in a few clicks! We were also awarded the title Alexa Champion by Amazon. Alexa Champions distinguishes twenty of the most engaged developers and contributors in the community on a worldwide level. You have secured EUR400k in funding last September. What was the most challenging part of the fundraising process? Convincing European investors to invest in voice while the voice assistant market was purely American was the most challenging issue. We had a real time to market issue that we decided to compensate for by broadening our conversational AI solution to include the chatbot market, which already was already taking off in Europe. Creating intelligent chatbots brings us an immediate revenue stream. Smartly was accelerated by NUMA. How would you describe your experience with the program? The experience was game changing! We had the opportunity to meet passionate and talented entrepreneurs, explore the Silicon Valley and pitch our company in front of the best investors! All this helped us greatly to gain traction and raise funds. Would you agree that the French startup ecosystem is in good shape and on a growth path? Yes, in recent years France has become a buzzing hub for startups! The government is helping with the FrenchTech Initiative, which pushes French startups onto the international stage with events such as CES. The pool of talent here is just amazing, with top grade engineers, especially in AI, which is a highly mathematical field. Why do you think there is so much excitement about AI right now? Is it about technology advancement or market readiness? I would say a mix of both. Things are moving fast in terms of technological advancement, for example computers can now be programmed to 'think' like a human with 'machine learning', which opens a wealth of opportunities with regard to AI advancement. At the same time the public is also becoming increasingly aware of the benefits that AI can bring, on both a personal and professional level. Consequently more and more businesses are wanting to get on board with AI in order to reach their consumers. Furthermore, AI can also be of great help to the elderly, blind and the illiterate. What is next for Smartly? We are launching our new platform at the end of the month, which will set a new standard for conversational AI building platform! As artificial intelligence continues to transform our world, we will ensure that we provide both businesses and developers with the essential tools they need to harness the power of AI to change daily life, at both home and work, for the better. What is your prediction about the future of AI startups in Europe? Despite our talented resources and know how, competing with the big American firms will be a major challenge. Though, the emergence of vertically focused AI companies is something I really believe in for European AI startups. ",

    "content": "Europe has a long history of fashion and design, and with the adoption of new technologies, more and more exciting fashion tech startups are entering that space. In a way, fashion related tech startups have already changed the traditional relationships between consumers and brands and pushed the boundaries of traditional ways of thinking about fashion. As technological innovation continues to change the fashion world in different ways, many European startups have shown potential to disrupt our shopping habits and alter the way we do shopping. Here are 10 companies with the potential to shake the fashion industry: Chic by Choice - Winner of the Best fashion startup award at the The Europas Startup Conference and Awards in 2016, Chic by Choice is one-of-a-kind hire destination which allows women to access designer dresses, straight from the catwalks. Described as Uber for clothes, Chic by Choice's idea is to make garments from some of the world's best brands available on a short-term basis, at a fraction of the cost of buying, coupled with an efficient delivery service and excellent discount prices. Founded in 2014, Chic by Choice now operates offices in London and Lisbon and ships to more than 15 European markets, including the major fashion centers of the UK, Germany, France and Italy offering a selection of more than 40 designers. Showroom - Founded in 2012, Showrom is a Warsaw-based e-commerce platform, allowing customers to have access to clothing from numerous independent fashion designers, based in and around Central and Eastern Europe. The marketplace allows designers to upload photos and post descriptions of the items themselves and consumers can then buy straight from the designers, after each item has been approved by an experienced team. The brand has established itself as an important sales channel for independent fashion designers and today over 500 carefully selected designers with 25.000 products are selling via the platform. Mysprezz - Often described as \"Tinder for fashion\", MySprezz is the first app to instantly suggest the best looks for fashion inspiration based on your style and the weather. Launched in September 2016, this e-commerce is all about personalized fashion inspiration. It aims to help users dress better and shop smarter by allowing to swipe through personalised looks based on their profile (gender, style, budget, wardrobe, calendar and weather) with the possibility of shopping all the clothes, shoes and accessories of the looks they like. Famous brands such as Asos, Topshop, Farfetch, Mytheresa are already included in the system, along with 400 other brands. Fitle - Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Paris, Fitle is a french startup which offers virtual fitting technology for shopping clothes online. Started out as a kickstarter campaign, Fitle offers thousands of pieces of clothing, sorted by relevance and based on your style and need. In addition, Fitle offers the possibility to virtually try them on using your own customized avatar. Fitle relies on a large R&D team of more than twenty people and on the largest body database on the market. Used by 3+ millions users and encompassing over 200+ brands and e-commerce sites, fitle is close to revolutionising a online fashion industry. Thread - The Y Combinator alumni helps users make sense of the world of fashion by matching them up with their own personal stylist through its platform. Eight human personal stylists are currently helping men find a new image, dress well, or simply sort out their clothes shopping. Very easy to use: You join the site, take a style questionnaire and upload photos of yourself. A stylist then reviews your information and, supported by Thread's algorithms, the site generates style recommendations personalised for you, claiming to take into account over 50 elements of style, from eye colour and body shape to brand, fit, and fabric. The unique personal shopping experience of the London-based startup has already attracted over 500,000 male shoppers. Stylect - A Tinder-esque mobile app that helps women purchase their perfect shoes. By swiping left or right, users pick their choices from multiple websites and based on users' preferences, the app recommends your next possible purchase. Exclusively targeted at the female market Stylect allows a 99% female user base to browse through tens of thousands of pairs of shoes, keep tabs on the pairs they like, make purchases, and receive information about special offers, price reductions or nearby stores where the shoes are available. It's incredibly addictive, and not only for Carrie Bradshaw's fans. Stylect is based in London and took part in the Oxygen accelerator. Endeer - Given the fact that 80-85% of women are currently wearing the wrong size bra, Endeer is exploiting the customization aspects offered through 3D printing technologies to provide better bra buying experience. Using state-of-the-art technology, this startup creates made-to-measure, 3D-printed removable pads that can be used with bras made by partner brands. In other words, their software and hardware approach is focused only on the pragmatic problems women face in standardized models, enabling brands to better respond to customer needs and provide customized solutions. Claiming their mission as empowering every woman in a bra that fits, Endeer might be the future of lingerie. The French startup was founded in 2016. De Rigueur - De Rigueur is a Lyon-based startup that combines know-how in leather and technological innovation with the aim of introducing a new category of hybrid goods.

Infogram specializes in charts and infographics for customers who need to quickly and effectively convey complex ideas. This is Prezi's first acquisition and financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Peter Arvai, Prezi's CEO and co-founder, whom we interviewed a few months ago, stated: \"Prezi was inspired to unite with Infogram because of our shared mission to help people make better decisions by providing more effective tools for visual communication. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then the data that backs it up makes it credible. And without a story, data falls flat in effectiveness.\" Mikko Jarvenpaa, Infogram's CEO stated: \"Joining forces with Prezi means our mission to bring beautiful and informative infographics and other data visualization technologies to more users will happen even faster. With Prezi, we will continue our work as a world leader in data visualization to create more powerful, delightful and useful products than ever before.\" Founded in 2012 and based in Latvia, Infogram has reached huge popularity and emerged as an innovator in the area of data visualization. Over 3 million users created over 5 million charts and infographics that have been viewed over 1.5 billion times. Infogram conveniently offers multiple data import options. Users can create a variety of charts, maps, and infographics by simply uploading a file, connecting to various cloud services, or taking advantage of Infogram's API. Infogram has been adopted by a wide variety of customers, including media companies, key businesses, and educational institutions. Infogram is also the most successful startup that has originated from Latvia-just as Prezi is the most successful startup that incubated in Hungary and bridged that success to create a global company with offices in San Francisco, Budapest and Mexico City. Infogram will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Prezi and will remain in Latvia. Prezi will continue to invest in research and development of Infogram and will create a Data Visualization Center of Excellence in Latvia. Founded in 2009 in Budapest, Prezi now fosters a community of over 85 million users and over 325 million Prezi presentations around the world. Its investors include Accel Partners, Spectrum Equity, and TED conferences. ",

    "content": "The London-, US-, and China-based VC firm SILK Ventures announced today that it has raised a $500 million fund to invest in startups from across Europe and the US. The fund was created to invest into firms from Series A upwards in all tech verticals, but mostly with an emphasis on the firms that specialize in deep tech (AI, Robotics, Internet of Things), FinTech, deep science and HealthTech. Founded in 2015, SILK Ventures started out as a \"digital accelerator\" which connected startups with corporates, while creating ties with Asia. The investment firm also assisted in organizing and pitching events and startup tours to China. The \"accelerator\" of SILK Ventures doesn't take any equity and also supported the banking startup Revolut. Its brand new $500 million fund is being given 50% backing by the Chinese state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) Shenzhen, who is filling in the role of both an LP and Strategic Partner. The remaining 50% of the fund is being drawn from a group of \"confidential strategic corporations\". According to Angelica Anton, founding partner at SILK Ventures, it's the deep connections to Asia, and to China in particular that sets the firm apart from other VC firms. Portfolio companies of Silk Ventures will get a chance to collaborate closely with official investment departments within China's local governments to assist their expansion into the Chinese market. Angelica Anton, who has been an investment advisor to the People's Republic of China in the past, stated: \"We are globally aligned with expert partners in the US, Europe and Asia to work with China at the highest levels to ensure that our portfolio companies are not only well-funded, but have the best chance of success in the Asian market. SILK Ventures was built to change the way Chinese capital marries Western technologies, and we pride ourselves on the cultural and operational know-how within our expanding team.\" Other partners and associates at SILK Ventures include: Silicon Valley VC, Ian Foley; founder of China Bridge Capital, Edward Zeng; and former Goldman Sachs and Bank of China analyst, Di Ann. SILK Ventures stated that two or three officials from the Shenzhen Department of Trade and Investment will be present in the London-based office on a daily basis. ",

    "content": "Entrepreneurs know to expect questions about the competition in every investor pitch. And differentiating yourself is key - not only by the content of your answer (how your company is different), but the method of delivery (how you talk about those differences). The world of startups is quick to offer advice on how to format your competitive landscape analysis. It's a standard slide recommended in any deck (the trusty 2x2, the petal diagram, etc). But there is a striking lack of guidance around how to talk about that competition. Here are three tips on how to get it right: 1. Don't trash talk the competition Yes, you need to communicate why your product is different from competitors. However, the age-old advice \"show don't tell\" is key. Focus on your company. Whether you highlight your differentiated product, first-mover advantage, or unique expertise, stay away from insulting another company. Specifically, steer clear of negativity toward another founder, sharing any breaking scandals, or disparaging their culture. The more time you spend talking about a competitor, the less time you are talking about your own company. You want to keep a potential investor's attention on you, while also demonstrating you have a firm understanding of what it will take to be successful. At a recent startup festival this spring, Stripe cofounder Patrick Collison demonstrated his maturity in this exact situation. While Collison was explaining the founding story of his company on stage, the moderator jumped in to share a personal horror story about Stripe competitor Paypal. The moderator then asked Collison point blank: \"Did a similar experience lead to you founding Stripe?\" Collison's answer was telling: \"Well, I don't want to speak about any particular competitor. With Paypal in particular, we owe them a great deal for having done so much to create the online payments space.\" It would have been easy to trash the competition here. But Collison's smooth side-step allowed him to come across as a class act, while simultaneously directing attention away from a big competitor and toward his own impressive achievements. 2. \"We don't have any competition\" doesn't cut it Yes, of course your product is a special snowflake. But \"We don't have any competition\" is not the answer that will satisfy an investor. Do your homework. What need are you meeting? How do people meet this need currently? As you will need to come up with a list of companies vying for the same customers, you will similarly need to come up with a strategy for how to talk about them. What's more, having competitors proves to investors that this is an attractive space. If dollars are flowing into similar companies (especially if the investor you are pitching missed out on a successful earlier entrant), they may be even more likely to invest. At a recent startup competition, I saw the founder of a housing startup give a compelling pitch about their smart home solution. However, his answer to the competitor question - \"We really don't see any other competitors in this space\" - landed flat with the judges. While differentiated, the company certainly has direct competitors. All companies face some form of competition. Refusing to acknowledge this signals either ignorance of the competition or arrogance. Moreover, talking about the growth of the industry could have demonstrated that this is an attractive space for investment. (Of course, it's a balancing act -- you also don't want to convey that a market is overcrowded.) 3. Talk about predecessors with humility Every company's entrance into a market is paved by somebody. Speaking about predecessors with humility and grace shows the maturity, vision, and leadership needed to steer the ship. At a recent conference, I saw the founder of a glasses startup exemplify this approach perfectly. As a glasses company, the inevitable question is, \"How are you different from Warby Parker?\" The founder's answer spoke volumes. \"Warby Parker is a great company. They have done a ton for the industry and showed the potential to rethink this space. But let me tell you about what we do and how we're different.\" He went on to explain how their product - 100 percent custom, made-to-order glasses - competes with expensive designer glasses and addresses an entirely different market segment than Warby Parker. While this founder certainly appeared to have a fantastic product, it was the way he spoke about Warby Parker that stuck with me. His ability to articulate and frame the problem enables the audience to not only understand the difference between the two but to understand the need for both. His response sounded like that of a seasoned tech CEO, one who is not lacking for confidence in the product and vision. For entrepreneurs out there, the pitch is everything. And investors are buying into both the idea for the company and a partnership with you as a founder. By doing your homework and speaking about your competition with respect, insight, and humility, you'll communicate maturity to set that relationship off to a great start.

    "content": "Phred needed a job, and we were hiring, woohoo! Because we knew him through a mutual friend, the interview process began casually, with a \"get to know you\" cup of coffee. After the initial meeting, he submitted his resume -- and it was anything but ordinary. Rather than using Microsoft Word or PDF format, Phred's resume was in YAML, a text format that techies use for configuring computer environments. This sent a strong nerd-cred vibe that piqued our interest. Instead of giving Phred an arduous series of coding exercises at a whiteboard, as is all too common in my industry, we sent him home with a programming assignment. The task was to select and solve a few specific math problems in code. In Phred's words: \"It was not simply a test of my ability to write programming solutions to math problems. Rather, the goal was to have me demonstrate my development process from end to end:     - How I work with problem requirements and decide what to do;     - How I use version control;     - How I architect and develop a solution;     - How I test and document my work.\" \"Afterwards, I was invited by the team to join them for a formal code review. This was a great experience because it let me scope out the personalities and expertise of my future team (and vice versa), and enabled us all to get a feel for exactly what it would be like to work together.\"  Phred found his interview experience to be both reasonable and rigorous but also, relaxed and humanizing. And today, I am happy to report that Phred is a valued member of the team. As a technical manager, I've interviewed hundreds of people over the years. And, I've been on at least two or three dozen interviews myself. While my experience roughly follows industry norms, my opinion is that the usual tech hiring process is failing companies. The whiteboard test -- a go-to tech interview prop -- is unapologetically biased and filled with arbitrary limitations. With too much emphasis on candidates' pedigrees and performance under pressure baked into the process, we're likely ruling out great candidates while letting in less qualified ones! Is tech hiring broken? More than a bit! But we can fix it. At the very least, it may be time for an attitude adjustment. As an industry, we've seen several iterations of the Tech Interview:\n Interview 1.0. If you're over 30, you've almost definitely experienced this. The typical HR department screens tons of resumes. Hiring managers sift through those that get past the buzzword filter, pick a few that look interesting, and conduct phone interviews. Successful candidates troop in for a day of conversations with engineers from the team, leading to one offer, or sometimes zero offers. In interviews done poorly, candidates are asked the same questions over and over, with savvier job seekers using information gained in the first hour to game the system to their advantage in the second hour. If interviews are done well, you can build a good -- maybe even great team. Interview 2.0. I like to think of Interview 2.0 as \"Google-style\" interviews. Well documented on the Internet, these are fairly common at most tech companies. The initial screening is pretty much the same as Interview 1.0, with a few key differences. When candidates arrive for the onsite interview, they're presented with up to five intense whiteboard sessions -- solving problems in code or pseudo-code, drawing up architecture pictures, etc. While Interview 2.0 is manifestly better than the 1.0 iteration, it's still not perfect. For example, many solid candidates may think and problem-solve in a way that doesn't work as well when they're being judged in real time. On the other end of the spectrum, a boot camper may learn to \"crack the interview\" using something like Gayle Laakmann's excellent book. (Then again, anyone who has managed to solve all 150 questions in Laakmann's book is likely a much better programmer than when they finished bootcamp!) Interview 2.5. This is the interview style that I use most often. Screened candidates are given a take home test that's either open book (look up algorithms on Google) or closed book (honor system, show your work). I prefer open book because it closely resembles what real-world work is like. Problems are relatively hard (think 8 queens problem, optimally pack cubes in a bigger volume, build a web application that does X, interactive card game, minimum spanning tree, etc.) but can usually be solved in a few hours. Candidates are given a specified time frame -- 24, 48, or 72 hours to complete the test -- and told to solve the problem as if they were working on a production system and then share the solution when it's complete. A few things I love about this: I can find out if the code actually works, is well coded, is written by someone I want to know more about. Some developers can write code that \"sings.\" We want those developers! Typically, if you like what you see in a completed solution, the candidate is brought in for an Interactive Session to discuss the solution in depth (verify work). You can even propose new requirements. For instance, we might suggest that the input data does not fit in memory or that we want to run on a Raspberry Pi or use 1,000 computers in parallel, etc. The benefit with Interview 2.5 is clear: You get a good sense of what it's like to work with the candidate. Are they having fun? Are you? Would you enjoy seeing them again, every day? While bias still exists, there's more opportunity for different candidates to shine through as worthy members of your team. It's also possible to bring candidates in to join a group design discussion around a fictional problem or an existing day-to-day problem. I've done this multiple times, and it really works! Interview 3.0. I'm not totally convinced that a truly blind interview process is possible given the collaborative nature of technical work. However, the process can definitely be \"blinder.\" For example, we could Whenever there is bias and arbitrary limitations in the interview process, we're likely reducing the talent pool. In whiteboard sessions, we often restrict the use of Google and expect a linear thought process, neither of which occur naturally in the real world of work. Programmers have been rallying on social media against this grueling practice called \"whiteboard algorithm hazing.\" The current scenario favors candidates who perform well under pressure, which often leaves amazing talent behind. A really neat approach is offered by CodeFights, a San Francisco-based company that is flipping the conventional recruiting process on its head. The Silicon Valley startup matches job-seeking programmers with top employers anonymously. Coders battle bots and each other, earning points on a series of challenges. Those who perform well are given the opportunity to interview with top recruiters. Aside from providing a space to hone skills, CodeFights lets talented coders prove their competencies without race, gender, or background playing a role -- a fresh approach for the tech industry, where diversity issues and unconscious bias in recruiting, interviewing, and hiring has been problematic. The cultural lens that CodeFights attempts to sidestep is commonplace for many tech interviewers. We all want to hire people who \"get it,\" who \"fit in.\" But what we're often doing is creating a mono-culture of people just like us. By contrast, a healthy culture is rich, diverse, and growing -- changing to become more so all the time. Removing cultural fit as a criterion will likely get us better candidates. And while a \"no jerks\" filter is a must, being more open to differences of experience, personality, background, gender, and ethnicity just makes sense.

    "content": "Game shows haven't changed much in the last few decades. But The Future Group wants to combine television game shows with mixed reality technology. The Oslo, Norway-based startup raised $20 million to create a game show, Lost in Time, where contestants are filmed performing game show challenges in front of a green screen. The Future Group then adds an animated world around the contestant, so to the viewer at home, the contestants appear to be completely immersed in a castle or an abandoned mine. On top of that, the audience can play the same challenges on a mobile app, where they can see how they would do in parallel to the contestants. Ellen Lyse Einarsen, game producer at The Future Group, spoke about this futuristic game show at our recent GamesBeat Summit 2017 event in Berkeley, Calif. Above: Lost in Time. \"It's almost like a window into another world for those contestants,\" said David Jagneaux, gaming editor at UploadVR and moderator of the talk. \"The people at home get to see an entire world surrounding the contestants, but it's not just a passive viewing experience for them.\" All 24 tasks that the contestant is undertaking are available in an app for the home audience to play. The show features the Unreal game engine, and the point was to get young people who don't watch game shows to come back. \"We see great enthusiasm among the viewers,\" Lyse Einarsen said. \"We have average session lengths of more than 18 minutes, which is unique for a mobile app.\" The end result is a lot more engaging than watching people compete on an obviously fake TV production stage. But it's also a lot more complicated, as game developers have to make sure that they complete some tasks on time for the TV show to hit its production schedule, Lyse Einarsen said. But that's what made the project fun. \"It really felt like a frontier,\" Lyse Einarsen said. The technology could extend outside of game shows. Lyse Einarsen mentioned that the Future Group has a product called Frontier that does live renders. ",

    "content": "I've often made parallels between blockchain (Internet of Value) and Web (Internet of Information) in terms of the disruptive potential and societal benefits. They hold (though I do think blockchain will be bigger). Another parallel that is starting to emerge is one that, as a student of history, I'm aware we've seen many times over: the \"speculative bubble.\" Whether it's the South Seas, Dutch Tulips, or simply Internet 1.0, investors who want a piece of the action jump on board and drive prices to insane heights. What's been going on in the blockchain market over the past few months seems to be reaching that point. Accelerating this trend is the new form of crowdfunding known as ICOs -- initial coin offerings, where pretty much anybody can raise money. It's definitely a legal gray area, but whatever the facts are around the so-called Howey Test (to determine if something is a security), the fact is that it's happening and pretty much anybody can join in. In Internet 1.0, for example, most of the early stages were driven by venture capitalists. Today, it's the venture capitalists who are following the crowds. (This fact actually makes me wonder if we're going to see a disintermediation of the venture capital business. To their credit, I think Blockchain Capital's \"digital liquid fund\" shows one potential new model.) In my mind, this wave began in earnest last May with the original DAO raising $150 million via crowdfunding of Ether. While the story ended poorly, it highlighted an entirely new way of raising money. That's the really important part of the DAO. Now, it seems like we have a new ICO every week (or multiple per week). Some of these have ideas with definite long-term potential. Some I don't quite see. And others make no sense at all. Even for those that do make sense, the valuations are starting to get crazy. Case in point: Gnosis. The decentralized prediction market (we're going to have a few, to be sure) that offered only 5 percent of its tokens, has a whitepaper, and has basically no working product, raised $12.5 million in 15 minutes, giving it a valuation of nearly $300 million. Since then, speculation has taken it to over $1 billion. I am sorry, but there's no scenario where that makes any sense. The effect is rippling (pun intended -- you'll see why) to many others as well. Ripple, which is an enterprise-focused blockchain for international settlements, has a token, XRP, that has exploded in recent weeks. Don't get me wrong -- I believe Ripple actually has a great idea, is serving real customers, and has a working product. I also think it has good potential (disclosure: I own some). Still, the recent run-up seems excessive. But, if I had to guess, I would say the recently-postponed ICO for Tezos, coming up in June, is going to be the equivalent of Netscape's IPO. It will be the moment where pretty much everyone else turns to this industry and says, \"Oh wow, what the hell is going on over there?\" Why do I think that? A few reasons: 1. Tezos hasn't set a specific amount to be raised.\nThey will keep their ICO open for two weeks so people can keep putting money into it. And, as word gets out that more money will go in, FOMO will kick in. 2. Big names are behind it.\nOlaf Carlson-Wee, the founder of Polychain Capital and original Coinbase employee wunderkind has said he likes it, but bigger than that is Tim Draper saying he would invest directly in it. 3. At it's core, Tezos is a good idea, not a point solution.\nI've talked to Tezos and read their whitepaper (four times, mostly because it's SO deep), so something LIKE Tezos (a community-driven blockchain that can update itself) makes a ton of sense. On its own, it's not a bad investment. 4. Greed.\nThe returns on many of the higher profile ICOs have been ludicrous. 400 percent on Gnosis in three weeks? That may be an outlier, but combine that with the run-up in Bitcoin and Ethereum and you have a potent cocktail. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Tezos raised $300-500 million or more. Think people will notice that? I actually feel a little bad for Tezos because that amount of money, attention, and expectation is going to make it difficult for them to execute and deliver. Maybe I'm wrong. I just sense that, in the midst of all of these hyped ICOs, we're seeing a true bubble emerge, which, invariably, will create a crash. That's fine, and I hope everyone can protect themselves (although some won't be able to). While this is all going on, however, the true foundation of blockchain-driven innovation is being laid. Tezos is part of this, but, to my earlier point, too much attention at too young an age could kill it. Instead of surface-level things like decentralized casinos and prediction engines, it's the people building decentralized application platforms that are going to emerge from the rubble. They are building the infrastructure of the decentralized economy. But it's not as sexy (or even understood yet), and the hype noise is drowning a lot of it out. Frankly, I've been very surprised by how quickly this market has gone from the proverbial 0-60, but it has. So, since we are living in the Age of Accelerations, as Tom Friedman writes, I imagine that the boom-bust-rebirth cycle for blockchains will happen relatively quickly. The key thing, in my mind, is this. One of the first game-changing elements to the blockchain revolution is the fact that, now, raising investment funds is becoming democratized. It's Kickstarter + a share of ownership. That's cool, and it gives anyone the chance to get VC-like returns. Of course, it introduces a caveat emptor scenario of epic proportions because of how early and extreme some of these offerings are. Still, it's exciting and definitely liberating. Next week, I'm going to the Token Summit in NYC to do a deep dive on this. For now, understand the new ICO funding models, but don't get caught up in the hysteria.

    "content": "When we talk about cool ideas for the future, monetization isn't usually the first topic that comes to mind. But it is very important for the survival of mobile game and app developers. That's why we had two veterans of the space -- Zain Jaffer, CEO of mobile ad tech company Vungle, and Charles Hudson, venture partner at SoftTech VC and managing partner of Precursor Ventures -- talk it at our recent GamesBeat Summit 2017 event in Berkeley, Calif. \"Our view is there has to be consolidation,\" said Jaffer in a conversation with Hudson. \"The ad industry needs consolidation. As a developer, why would you want to work with hundreds of vendors?\" Above: Zain Jaffer (left), CEO of Vungle, and Charles Hudson, venture partner at SoftTech VC, speak about the future of monetization at GamesBeat Summit 2017. Six years ago, Jaffer made a big bet that video ads would turn into a big platform for advertising and monetizing mobile games. Now, the company collects data on more than a billion events a day. \"Data is the key asset, and how you use it determines whether you stay in business or don't,\" Jaffer said. Lots of ad platforms had the same idea, but only a small number have reached the kind of scale that is necessary to deliver insights and value back to the developers, Jaffer said. \"The reality for a lot of these companies is that it comes down to scale,\" Hudson said. \"Until you get to that point, a lot of the vendors kind of look and feel the same.\" Now, there are \"mobile first\" companies -- Snap, Spotify, and many others -- that are taking mindshare and audiences away from the traditional brands. Making sure that those mobile-first companies monetize early represents a big opportunity for the likes of Vungle. Hudson is a familiar figure on the game event circuit, as he ran the Social Gaming Summit in the early days of Facebook games. He was also the cofounder and CEO of Bionic Panda Games, an Android-focused mobile games startup based in San Francisco, and VP of business development for Serious Business until the company was acquired by Zynga in February 2010. He invested in 145 companies to date, and his investment in Vungle is the only one in ad tech. Above: Zain Jaffer (left), CEO of Vungle, and Charles Hudson, venture partner at SoftTech VC. In those earlier years, developers had to spend a lot of money on user acquisition because that was the only way they stood a chance at standing out from a million other developers in the app stores. Unfortunately, app discovery still hasn't been solved. Getting featured by Apple or Google is still the main strategy for game and app developers, Jaffer said. \"I understand people feel the way they do about ad tech,\" said Jaffer. \"I got burned myself in the public markets, and I can understand why people are so skittish about the space. But the ad ecosystem is so different and unique. It's a shame there hasn't been a multibillion-dollar market cap company yet.\" As for the future, both ad-tech companies and developers have to figure out how to thrive in Asia. Jaffer is British, and his parents immigrated to the U.S. from Uganda. He found moving into the Asian markets, particularly China, was both exceedingly difficult and important at the same time. \"I realized you can't just treat China like another market,\" Jaffer said. When Zynga China shut down, Jaffer hired a bunch of the engineers. And it has never stopped investing in that market. Asia is now a third of Vungle's revenue. Here's the video of their talk.  ",

    "content": "Swiss startup MindMaze, which raised $100 million in funding, has launched its MindMaze Pro virtual reality treatment for stroke recovery patients in the U.S. The launch shows that VR is for more than just games, as it stands at the intersection of neuroscience and entertainment. The launch is the latest example of how VR is spreading far beyond games and entertainment. And that's important, as consumer VR sales have been slower than expected. Based on a decade of research and testing for \"neuro VR,\" the MindMaze Pro is an upper-limb neurorehabilitation platform that uses proprietary 3D motion-tracking cameras to help patients recovering from traumatic injuries and those suffering from acute and chronic strokes. MindMaze introduced MindMotion Pro to the European market in 2013, and hundreds of patients have used the platform for the rehabilitation therapy. Lausanne, Switzerland-based MindMaze already delivered a thought-powered virtual reality, augmented reality, and motion capture game system in MindLeap. The company, whose board includes some of the world's leading doctors and neuroscientists, will be applying its multisensory computing platform to numerous new fields, which include robotics and transportation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted MindMaze 510(k) clearance. Mindmaze also said that it has completed 261 patient trials of MindMotion Go, a portable neurotechnology device that uses VR to continue therapy after a patient leaves the hospital. Those trials were conducted in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland. Above: MindMaze Pro is approved for use in the U.S. and European markets. MindMaze CEO Tej Tadi, a doctor, started the company in 2012. Each year in the U.S., about 800,000 people suffer a stroke, resulting in debilitating health effects as well as direct and indirect losses of economic activity of $65 billion according to research published in The American Journal of Managed Care. MindMotion Pro works by mapping a patient's movements onto 3D avatars in customized interactive exercises that are based on standardized neurorehabilitation principles of upper limb rehabilitation and cognitive paradigms. By doing so, it reactivates damaged neural pathways and activates new ones. MindMaze's technology is specifically designed to help stroke patients and those with traumatic brain injuries start recovery early and continue it for maximum gains. MindMotion Pro uses VR games to keep patients engaged with therapies for recovery. It has custom tracking technology that gives real-time and accurate patient tracking in both bedside and wheelchair uses. It also helps the therapist in supporting the patient during the activities. Above: MindMaze engages stroke victims with games. \"Our work at the forefront of neuroscience and virtual reality allows patients to recover faster and return more fully to the life they lived before injury,\" said Tadi in a statement. \"Over the last decade, we've honed this therapy to be cost-effective for both patients and healthcare providers.\" Due to the motivating effects of the virtual-reality based games, patients can engage in 10 to 15 times more exercising repetitions than with standard rehabilitation programs, and because the system offers real-time multisensory feedback, therapists can assess progress and tailor therapy to patient performance. Research from the leading rehabilitation facility Clinique Romande de Readaptation/EPFL in Sion, Switzerland, found that 90 percent of chronic stroke patients using MindMotion Pro reported heightened motivation to perform rehab, increased the potential for motor function recovery and that their training intensity doubled within the first 10 sessions of using the platform. Additionally, Lausanne University Hospital-CHUV reported 100 percent of patients forgot they were in a hospital. ",

    "content": "People often ask me, \"Why did you move from San Francisco to, uh, Detroit?\" The answer is easy. In 10 years, San Francisco will be as good as it is today, but Detroit will be a roaring city once again, defining a new technology hub at the intersection of steel and bits. When choosing to move to Detroit, a city that has been in a recent state of rebuild, many do so to roll up their sleeves, get to work, and make a difference. These attributes are what's needed in an entrepreneur, which makes the city's vibe appealing to early stage startups. When entrepreneurs make the pilgrimage to San Francisco to change the world with their ideas, they do so for the vast amount of resources present in the Valley. Detroit, too, has immense resources at an entrepreneur's disposal, but to build and scale in Detroit is to build and scale Detroit itself - something you can no longer do in the Valley. And this is the reason I packed up and left San Francisco for Detroit in October of 2011. I wanted to take part in the emerging entrepreneurial gold rush in Detroit. I wanted to help fuel the startup renaissance and create a legacy. And over the last six years, I've seen the seeds of entrepreneurship blossom into a growing and thriving ecosystem. (Check out the documentary Generation Startup to see what it is like to build a startup in Detroit.) The cost of living and doing business in Detroit is much lower than in coastal hubs like San Francisco and New York. You can hire a recent computer science graduate for $60K vs. $120K on the coasts. According to Numbeo, the cost of living in San Francisco is 93 percent higher than in Detroit. Your employees can afford a wonderful house in a great neighborhood, live in an amazing school district, and not break the bank. Not something you could do easily in San Francisco or New York. But across metro Detroit, you can. And that means more money to hire and scale your company. Your employees can raise a family and still live on an early stage startup salary. And your venture capital investors can see higher returns as a result of less capital needed to scale the business. Detroit has a great talent network spanning universities, Fortune 500 companies, and business titans. Google got its seed funding as research out of the University of Michigan. A high percentage of the top venture capitalists in the United States have taken Professor David Brophy's classes on venture capital. With 75 percent of the US automotive industry R&D investment located in Michigan, the future of self-driving cars will be built and tested across Detroit. New facilities like Mcity and the American Center for Mobility will support testing and validation of autonomous vehicles. And business titans that call Detroit home include Dan Gilbert, Roger Penske, Chris Ilitch, and Bill Ford. There's a hidden diamond in the Midwest that contains an economy larger than California. Chicago to Detroit, down through Cleveland to Pittsburgh, bending through Columbus to Cincinnati, and coming full circle through Indianapolis back to Chicago.  Image source: The Diamond in the Midwest Within this map, there is a significant intersection of talent and business: And if Drive Capital's Chris Olson is right, in five years, the Midwest will have more startups than Silicon Valley. Three years ago, Techstars Mobility launched in Detroit. Since then, we've seen many startups relocate or open up shop in Detroit to tap into the automotive dominance of the region. SPLT and Lunar, part of the 2015 class of Techstars Mobility, both relocated from NYC to Detroit. Together they now employ over 40 individuals in the city's downtown. And Oblong, PolySync, and Mapbox all opened offices operating out of the Techstars office. According to the 2017 Michigan Venture Capital Association Research Report, there are 141 active venture-backed startups across Michigan. Some hot sectors include fintech (e.g., Benzinga in Detroit), life science/healthcare (e.g., Millendo Therapeutics in Ann Arbor), and security (Duo Security also in Ann Arbor). Higher growth startups include Rocket Fiber that provides gigabit internet and Shinola that is bringing back manufacturing to Detroit. Midtown is the most welcoming to the startup community. With lower cost, incredible food and drink, and university access, this area has it all. Anchoring Midtown is Wayne State University, the third largest university in Michigan. Nearby is TechTown, a non-profit business accelerator, and Next Energy, one of the first research pavilions in the nation to offer access to a smart microgrid and a smart home. A few blocks away is Green Garage, a supportive, sustainable co-working space, which was formerly a showroom for Model T automobiles in the 1920s. Midtown is also where Techstars Mobility partnered with Foundry Group to provide a house for free to founders building their startups in Detroit. Startups also call downtown home too. WeWork Detroit and Bamboo Detroit offer founders plenty of space to build their businesses. The Madison Block (one of seven tech hubs sponsored by Google for Entrepreneurs) is home to a dozen startups and venture capital funds, including Ludlow Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners, Draper Triangle, Microsoft Ventures, and Twitter. On the rise is also Eastern Market, home to the United State's largest open-air market. Lots of great lofts are occupied by a growing number of startups. Many founders are known to frequent Avalon International Breads, The Bottom Line Coffee House, Motor City Brewing, and the Jolly Pumpkin, all in Midtown. If you're looking to run into an investor or corporate exec, you might want to check out the Sugar House, home to the best cocktail in America, Selden Standard, a seasonal American restaurant, Chartreuse, voted best restaurant in Detroit, or Green Dot Stables, where everything on the menu is $3 (a personal favorite, where bills shock my coastal friends). Detroit Startup Week, a week of free entrepreneurial-focused panels and networking events in May, is a great place to meet with people in the startup community. In fact, Lunar hired 2 people from the 2016 Detroit Startup Week. Also in May is the Michigan Growth Capital Symposium, which is heading into its 36th year, attracting 100s of investors and startups. Every fall is the annual Techstars Mobility Demo Day which draws 1000+ attendees as the largest single day startup event in Michigan. Whether you decide to come to Detroit for 36 hours (great post on the NYTimes on doing so) or eventually call it home, the city and region is rapidly growing. New early stage startups are popping up at an increasing rate, music is flourishing in Detroit - Jack White just opened his new Third Man Records storefront in Midtown - and new restaurants, shops, and art are opening up every day (like Warby Parker, Bonobos, Nike, and Under Armour). Building something in Detroit is building Detroit. Special thanks to Hunter, Rohith, David, Chris, and Lisa for reviewing drafts of this article.

    "content": "So Uber officially launched its not-so-secret trucking business, Uber Freight, on Thursday, as the Silicon Valley tech titan looks to infiltrate another lucrative industry: long-distance road freight. Uber first announced the service back in September, but the program had remained in stealth mode ever since. In a nutshell, Uber Freight wants to do for the trucking and logistics industries what Uber has been doing for the personal mobility sphere for years -- match supply with demand. More specifically, it wants to connect trucking companies with loads that need to be hauled, minimizing the amount of time trucks travel empty after delivering their load. \"We take the guesswork out of finding and booking freight, which is often the most stressful part of a driver's day,\" explained Uber Freight product manager Eric Berdinis. \"What used to take several hours and multiple phone calls can now be achieved with the touch of a button.\"  For Uber, the move makes total sense. At its core, Uber isn't a simple online taxi service -- it's a transport network and marketplace that bridges distances to connect buyers with sellers. This is why the company has already branched out into food delivery and dabbled in other forms of product deliveries. But the trucking industry is being disrupted from multiple angles and perspectives, with Uber merely the latest player to enter the fray. In fact, there has been a flurry of activity across the tech-truck realm in 2017. Here, we take a look at five other emerging trucking startups, each looking to claim their slice of the lucrative freight delivery pie, whose annual worth is more than $700 billion in the U.S. alone -- a figure that stretches into the trillions globally. Founded out of Mountain View, California in 2011, Peloton Technology is developing a platform designed to help improve safety, fuel consumption, and operational efficiency in truck platooning. With Peloton's technology integrated into every truck in a fleet, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications is used to enable each truck to automatically react to the actions of the vehicle in front of it. This allows the trucks to operate more safely as part of a closer pack, which helps lower fuel consumption and reduce emissions. The company is working with a number of truck manufacturers, including Volvo, which participated in Peloton's recent $60 million funding round.  Founded out of San Mateo in 2016, Embark officially unveiled its self-driving truck technology a few months back, after a period operating in stealth. The company has developed a highway autopilot system that powers autonomous trucks. As with similar technologies powering the fast-emerging self-driving vehicle industry, Embark uses sensors, radars, and cameras to understand its environment and avoid collisions, and it improves over time. Embark plans to launch 100 percent self-driving trucks onto roads, specifically targeting long stretches of highway that connect cities and towns and that are largely free of cyclists and congestion. It's partly about helping alleviate truckers' fatigue and boredom, and it will let them carry out other tasks while on the road. When the truck enters a city boundary, the driver regains control of the vehicle.    Founded out of San Francisco in 2013, KeepTruckin sets trucking companies up with hardware and software that lets drivers keep digital logs of hours driven. With the physical KeepTruckin device attached to the truck, drivers can track their hours through a smartphone app. It also lets trucking companies see where their fleet is in real time. KeepTruckin announced an $18 million funding round this week, with some notable investors on board, including Alphabet's investment arm GV (formerly Google Ventures). It's still early days for Einride, but last month the Swedish startup lifted the lid on T-pod, an autonomous electric truck that can also be controlled remotely. The company's goal is to have a fleet of 200 T-pods running in Sweden by 2020, with plans to launch its first route between the Swedish cities of Gothenburg and Helsingborg. According to Einride, the initial system will transport more than two million pallets each year, with each 23-feet pod able to hold 15 \"standard\" pallets for a total weight of 20 tons. Similar to Embark, T-pod adopts a hybrid approach to driverless technology. On highways, the trucks are capable of total autonomy, though remote drivers are on hand to take over should the situation require it. And when the vehicles exit onto city roads, Einride's trucks switch to full remote control. Each T-pod can travel 124 miles on one charge, and Einride is also currently developing charging stations for the vehicles. Last week, OnTruck, a Spain-based on-demand platform that connects businesses with road freight companies, announced a $10 million round of funding led by Atomico, the investment firm set up by Skype cofounder Niklas Zennstrom. Founded out of Madrid in 2016, Ontruck offers an on-demand platform that's a little similar to Uber Freight, in that it's all about connecting freight delivery networks with shipments. We actually called it the \"Uber for trucking and logistics\" when we covered OnTruck's funding round last week -- before Uber launched its own freight delivery business. The companies above highlight ways companies are leveraging technology to optimize the global trucking and freight industry. There are countless other players operating in the space, with many focused on select regions, including U.S.-based Transfix and Trucker Path, France's Convargo and Chronotruck, Brazil's Cargox, and iCanDeliver from the Netherlands. Elsewhere, automotive giant Volvo is testing some interesting technologies around trucks and automation. Earlier this week, it unveiled an autonomous garbage collection truck, which is currently being trialed in Sweden. This follows a similar experiment Volvo announced last year that used trucks in underground mines.  ",

    "content": "As the U.S. becomes acclimated to the reality of a new president, something that's on the minds of many Americans is the changing economic landscape. People are fearful of the impact automation and technology will have on their livelihoods -- it's estimated that 5 million jobs could be lost by 2020 because of the \"fourth industrial revolution,\" according to the 2016 World Economic Forum. Is the solution to all of this simply teaching workers how to code? Obviously not. \"Countries will have to invest in transforming their workforce if they want to keep up with the changes and avoid a worse case scenario of 'talent shortages, mass unemployment, and growing inequality',\" said WEF founder and chairman Klaus Schwab. Above: Christine Lu at Barcamp Shanghai in 2009. Los Angeles-based entrepreneurs Christine Lu, Shuchi Rana, and Bret Blount may have a bold approach to solving this eventual employment crisis in Middle America. The team has created America Innovates, a program aimed at looking beyond Silicon Valley to facilitate new innovation hubs in the U.S. Armed with capital from various investors, including some from China, Lu and her team work with universities, local governments, area businesses, and other parties to establish innovation districts that will benefit the community. \"It's about how do we steer investments into communities of America while being inclusive?\" Lu explained to VentureBeat in an interview. The program is divided into two parts: an opportunity fund and a platform. The former functions similarly to a venture fund, putting money into innovation districts and the startups that operate within them. America Innovates will create dedicated funds for each city it operates in -- Lu said Los Angeles, which is one of the fund's first markets, will be allocated $25 million. Other cities being considered include Durham, Austin, Denver, and Atlanta. As for the platform, America Innovates said it is launching next month. The aim is to bring together investors, philanthropists, and companies that are working in health, education, science, and sustainability. One way to describe the platform is as a combination of AngelList and a Kickstarter for social impact. \"We're tired of talking about the political climate,\" Lu explained. \"[It's about] what we can do to be Americans. Job creation is nonpartisan. Investment into local communities and job creation can be nonpartisan.\" Above: America Innovates focuses on local communities by providing global access. An Intuit study estimates that by 2020, more than 40 percent of the U.S. workforce will be made up of freelance workers. The traditional model of employment has changed, and so too must the way business is done. The new workers are innovators, those who spot a problem in the world and believe they have the solution. So how can communities embrace this spirit of innovation instead of forcing entrepreneurs to flee to Silicon Valley, New York City, and other places with well-established hubs of innovation? America Innovates wants to help Middle America stem the talent drain. It's not about encouraging a big tech company to set up its headquarters in a city and calling it a day -- it's about steering outside investment into the cities where entrepreneurs and talent are already living. Lu and her team want to facilitate innovation districts, described by the Brookings Institute as areas able to \"facilitate the creation and commercialization of new ideas and [support] metropolitan economies by growing jobs in ways that leverage their distinct economic attributes.\" Above: Some potential cities being considered for innovation districts by America Innovates. While it's easy to think of America Innovates as yet another effort to create the next Silicon Valley -- think Silicon Alley, Silicon Beach, Silicon Prairie, or even the Downtown Project in Las Vegas -- this isn't the  group's intention. Lu explained that the benchmark is tied to job creation and impact. \"Capital alone won't make this work,\" she admitted, which is why America Innovates is working with multiple parties to get it right. The group is looking for cities close to universities that could source talent and is asking questions like whether those cities have a growing real estate market. Lu's team will also look at the local startup ecosystem and will form relationships within the city government. Right now, America Innovates is targeting June for the initial launch of its platform. It'll begin inviting founders in July before bringing on investors in September and formally opening up in beta this October. An innovation district challenge is scheduled to start in 2018. Chris Noble, Matchfire chief executive and advisor to America Innovates, outlined three criteria that must be met in order for a city to be selected. The first is that the city contains a \"healthy intellectual environment in a market.\" Does the community possess expertise in genetics, robotics, or another viable field? \"It's a matter of specialization,\" he said. \"It can't be [just] because a company is there.\" Above: How America Innovates says it works to benefit all. The next threshold is determining whether the city already has an entrepreneurial climate. If not, how can it foster innovation? Any efforts will remain stagnant without the necessary support and resources. Noble pointed out that places such as Detroit have been convinced that they're not entrepreneurial, when in fact they are. Lastly, as it's a business, America Innovates needs to know that it's choosing a city where it'll get the most leverage for its dollars. More than two years have been spent researching these issues, and no one believes throwing dollars at the problem will result in a quick fix. Instead, Lu's team is taking a more strategic approach. \"You are dealing with technology, real estate, public policy, and socioeconomic challenges,\" she said. \"That's not easy, and it's not overnight. It's not about making a little [minimum viable product].\" Above: Six elements critical to the success of innovation districts. America Innovates has identified a total of six key elements needed to make these innovation districts a success. In addition to those that have already been mentioned -- entrepreneurial hubs, education, real estate, and job creation -- the program looks at social impact, which means partnering with communities to make sure that nonprofits, students, and charitable groups also reap the benefits of these endeavors. Lastly, any action taken requires a strong investment network, something that Lu's team will bring to the table. For more than 20 years, Lu has worked with China-based businesses to make investments in the U.S., as well as advising companies on cross-border topics. It's this experience that led her to start America Innovates, because there was \"no shortage of money from China coming in. I saw Chinese money coming into America for real estate that didn't benefit communities.\" Constantly prodded for advice about where investors can put their money, Lu opted to try a fresh approach, one that doesn't result in more low wage jobs, but will hopefully lead to the creation of better jobs. These will in turn see real estate values increase -- a win-win situation. While she has a penchant for working with Chinese investors, Lu said that this is not the only capital America Innovates is turning to. Right now, the organization has received seed capital for setup and operations, though there's still more work to be done before the first building is identified and purchased. But the wheels are in motion. \"We're not trying to reinvent the wheel, but accelerate it,\" she declared. ",

    "content": "It's been a week since the WannaCry ransomware attack began infecting computers running Windows software. And things are strangely silent again. It's almost as if the wake-up call that WannaCry set off was heard by IT managers around the world -- and then they hit the snooze button. In a way, that's not a bad thing. The cybersecurity community worked quickly and effectively to defuse the threat, while the kill switch demanded by digital kidnappers -- Bitcoin payment -- proved more difficult to manage than life without an infected computer. As of late Friday, after many of the deadlines threatening data deletion had passed, few victims had paid ransoms. According to Elliptic Enterprises, only about $94,000 worth of ransoms had been paid via Bitcoin, which works out to less than one in a thousand of the 300,000 victims who were reportedly affected by WannaCry. So we're safe... right? Looking back with the benefit of a week's hindsight, two lessons are apparent. First, the story of the WannaCry attack is the stuff of cyberthrillers. Based on tools developed by the National Security Agency, WannaCry spread through phishing emails containing job offers, invoices, or security warnings. The malware infected as many as 300,000 computers, the vast majority of them using Windows 7 but apparently not running Windows Update, which might have otherwise installed a patch Microsoft created in March. Infected computers ranged from those at companies like FedEx to systems in the hospitals of Britain's National Health Service, raising the stakes of the attack from a corporate headache to a potentially life-and-death matter. Meanwhile, in a sleepy British seaside town, a 22-year-old researcher named Marcus Hutchins helped slow the malware's spread early Saturday by discovering, and then registering, a domain name inside its code. On Monday, reports of the ransomware caught fire. Stocks in the cybersecurity sector predictably spiked. Google Trends -- a crude but useful measure -- shows interest mounted on Monday, as the business world returned to work and booted up their PCs. It has since steadily declined, to the point that software security has once again becoming something of an afterthought. As the New York Times pointed out, many IT managers are calling the WannaCry hackers' bluff. That blithe spirit is bolstered by a vulnerability that researchers in France discovered and deployed to unlock computers infected with WannaCry (with caveats -- victims can't reboot their ill computers, and they can't keep them running too long while infected.) That's the good news. The overall response of the cybersecurity community has been strong enough to save many of the companies and organizations that had repeatedly dismissed previous wake-up calls. Which brings us to the second lesson. While not as bad as feared, ransomware (not to mention cybersecurity threats in general) isn't going away. Wired reported that the domain registered by Hutchins has been under intense denial-of-service attacks delivered by an army of IoT devices marshalled, zombie-like, by Mirai. Mirai was the botnet that made news last fall by taking down sites like Spotify, Twitter, Reddit, and Netflix, thanks to unsecured IoT devices. So here's Act II of this month's cyberthriller: A highly effective hacking front is turning its efforts to free another semi-effective hacking initiative contained by the white-hat cybersecurity community. Fall back asleep, and this may quickly turn into a nightmare. Malignant hacking campaigns are every bit as incremental as the software iterations being perfected by Facebook, that corporate entity headquartered on Hacker Way. Both set a mountaintop goal and both will charge back up again and again, no matter how many times it takes. Both learn, AI-like, by seeing what works and what doesn't. And now for Act III. The Hollywood narrative calls for the cybersecurity community to respond. How? (For starters, I'd suggest quashing the name cybersecurity -- even \"digital security\" sounds better. Terms like \"cyber\" are so, um, 1990s). But that depends on two things. First, cybersecurity needs to take itself seriously. Sophos, for example, failed to update its antivirus software to block WannaCry until a few hours after the virus had infected clients, Reuters reported. Second, IT managers have to stop putting off the inevitable when the inevitable involves a data breach that will affect a company's technology, brand, and -- above all -- customers. \"I don't want to sound alarmist, but I think we're just seeing the tip of the iceberg -- the number of cybersecurity incidents in coming years is going to multiply,\" Dimitri Stiliadis told VentureBeat after his company, Aporeto, was one of several cloud security startups to receive funding this week. \"The root cause is, if you think about how businesses develop software, security is often the last thing they want to think about because it's not a revenue-generating function.\" If there's anything we've learned in this past week, it's that IT teams have seen security as an afterthought for too long. A lot of IT networks dodged a bullet, thanks in part to quick countermeasures from the digital-security community, but mostly because employees have learned not to bite on phishbait. WannaCry turned out to be a short-term sob fest. It's up to corporate IT managers to make sure it doesn't become an occasion for grieving. ",

    "content": "Five years ago, Square launched a program to guide female high school and college students as they worked toward becoming engineers. More than 140 female college students from across the United States and Canada have gone through the program, with some even joining the company afterward. Square is now changing things up by taking the college version of Code Camp on the road to its Atlanta, Georgia office. The program is now accepting applications from interested students. While Code Camp normally takes place in San Francisco, this is the second time that it's been held in another city, the first being New York City last year. The company shared that it chose Atlanta because it is interested in supporting the local community, one that's filled with engineering talent from nearby universities and businesses -- and because it's also home to quite a few startups and businesses. The Georgia city happens to be one of the first places that Square set up an outpost beyond the Bay Area. Twelve students will be selected to participate in the program, which will take place from August 14 to 19. While learning about the tech company and developer issues, participants will also have a chance to sit down with Square executives, including chief executive Jack Dorsey and Square Capital and people lead Jacqueline Reses. Mock interviews will be part of the curriculum, in addition to a hackathon and a team project. \"Code Camp helped to expose me to new technical concepts that I use in my work at Square,\" stated Alyssa Pohahau, a Square engineer who went through Code Camp in 2014. \"Beyond coding skills, one of the most valuable things is the community of diverse women you become a part of. We've created this community of women who cheer each other on throughout every phase of career development, from college to job interviews to navigating the working world.\" Applications are now being accepted through June 1.

    "content": "[Updated 1:01pm, 5/19/2017 to correct the dry powder figure in the first paragraph, which was erroneously given as $41 billion.] On the heels of a decade-high year in VC fundraising, 2017 remains strong. In PitchBooks's latest funding report, we found that U.S. VCs raised 58 funds in the first quarter, to the tune of $7.9 billion. Add this to the $121 billion in dry powder that is already waiting to be deployed to the world's most promising startups. Despite a shortage in VC-backed exits, investors continue to place bets on VC as it remains one of the asset classes where they can benefit from outsized performance. The allure of finding the next Silicon Valley unicorn such as Uber, Slack, or AirBnB is a powerful motivator. On a historical basis, VC funds have consistently outperformed all other fund types over three-year and five-year horizons - PE, debt funds, fund of funds, according to our data. In 2014 and 2015, VC funds returned $119 billion to investors, which has since led to a large amount of reinvestment in the asset class. We also found that the median time to exit for VC-backed companies in the U.S. has crept to 8.2 years for an IPO and five years for acquisitions or buyouts, the highest levels recorded in the last decade. Many startups are opting to raise a down or flat round or find ways to lengthen their cash runway rather than go through a liquidity event. Take BuzzFeed as a perfect example of this trend. The unicorn startup secured $200 million in late stage financing late last year, valued at $1.7 billion and is reportedly aiming for $350 million in revenue this year. Also on this list are Houzz, Qualtrics, WeWork, Ola, and AirBnB, to name a few. This trend is creating a cyclical challenge for investors. They continue to fund late-stage companies, arming them with healthy cash reserves to stay private longer, which impacts their ability to generate returns for limited partners in a timely manner. Global VC contributions from 2012 through 2015 were the highest of any four-year period since 2002, with nearly $175 billion paid in. But the returns distributed from these contributions are lagging. The latest global net cash flow reports we looked at show VCs still owe $12.8 billion to their investors - and that's just to break even. The consequence of this is a level of illiquidity that limited partners had not planned for, which impacts expected and actual returns as well as fees paid. So, where does this \"new normal\" lead us? At this point, it will be several years before the venture asset class will know if the \"staying private longer but growing bigger\" (aka the Unicorn experiment) is positive or negative for returns. In the meantime, investors must grapple with the bigger unanswered question of what the VC industry will look like if the expected fund lifetime stretches to 15 years? That is, what are the return expectations on that duration of illiquidity? How do fees get charged? What happens to key man clauses (15 years is half a career...) etc.? The trend of staying private longer will only continue, especially after watching the early challenges faced in the public market by unicorn companies like Facebook, Twitter, and more recently Snap. While staying private longer allows more time to establish profitability, waiting too long only increases pressure to maintain nearly impossible levels of growth, and market forces could shift making an exit unwise. It's clear the VC industry is in the middle of a development phase, but how it will emerge on the other side remains a question mark. The stigma associated with early stage investors exiting in later stage rounds will soon become obsolete as the industry accepts it not as signaling risk but as a fiduciary duty by the early VCs. Limited partners and general partners are already thinking seriously about addressing more permanent capital structures.

Mahjoubi was named to the post this week after having served as a digital advisor to Macron's independent presidential bid over the past year. Born in Paris to parents who emigrated from Morocco, Mahjoubi is a familiar name in French startup circles. On the entrepreneurial side, he was a cofounder of the company behind La Ruche Qui Dit Oui, a community-driven food network that connects farmers and local customers. La Ruche was the recipient of Union Venture's first investment in a French company in 2015. But Mahjoubi has also been in and out of politics, having served in other political campaigns. In 2015, he was also appointed by Macron, then Minister of the Economy, to serve on Le Conseil national du numerique, a 30-person body that advises the French government on digital issues. As the new digital minister, he will take charge of La French Tech, the program started by the previous administration to accelerate development of France's startup economy. Meanwhile, Macron's En Marche! movement has transformed itself into an official political party called Republique En Marche, following his victory. For shorthand, this party is currently using the initials: R.E.M. So, yes. R.E.M. is now a French political party. ",

    "content": "Presented by Intel Immersed Games is an early-stage edtech (educational technology) startup unlike any other, the brainchild of a diehard MMORPG player and PhD candidate Lindsey Tropf, born in the wake of a World-of-Warcrafttriggered epiphany. And suddenly Tropf found herself the founder and CEO of a game company. \"I had been a pretty hardcore gamer myself, but not into game development at all,\" Tropf says. \"I was working on more an educator path, but I realized the immense power games have for learning while playing World of Warcraft one day.\" In the midst of a game session, she turned to her husband and asked where to find something, Tropf recalls. \"When he rattled off the right character, in the right city, on the right continent of the game, it was then that I realized how much we had learned, simply through the act of play,\" she says. \"But while I knew so much, not much of it really mattered outside of the game world.\" She started studying that phenomenon as part of her PhD work, digging into learning theory specifically, increasingly realizing that an online game could provide the perfect model for an ultra-effective learning platform--and that this power had not yet been harnessed. \"I discovered some pretty major limitations, in my view, with the educational game market,\" Tropf says. \"I found that most educational games were pretty shallow. It was kind of 'answer a math problem and you get to shoot a zombie,' but it didn't pull on the problem-solving that games are really amazing at.\" And she found that the few good educational games available on the shelves weren't taking advantage of the full power of the medium. They didn't have the depth, and breadth, and potential that Tropf knew could be tapped into to keep a kid fully immersed and learning. And so Tyto Online was born. \"I got super excited about the possibilities and started a game company,\" says Tropf. \"Instead of solving problems around the lore and content I had been learning in MMOs, I wanted to do it around science and other topics,\" says Tropf. What Tropf developed was a futuristic MMORPG that taps into the uniquely immersive narrative experience that all MMORPGs offer, which famously keep their players always coming back for more. Above: Tyto Online is designed to provide insight and education that students will take with them outside the game environment. In Tyto Online, you play as a Tyto Academy student in the year 2084. The earth has been devastated, and humanity has been relocated to Ovo, a jungle planet four years' space travel from home. As one of the best and the brightest young minds of your generation, you've been recruited to help the world's foremost scientists colonize Ovo, as well as to discover the key to restoring the Earth to a habitable state. No pressure. The game is currently in early access, with the first module--ecology--in place. \"We have sets of quests that students do, but instead of being wrapped around general problem-solving, they're more specifically focused on ecology-oriented problem-solving, creating food webs [the natural interconnection of food chains], fixing invasive species problems, and things like that,\" Tropf says. \"And as players do that, they're leveling up in ecology, and they're unlocking more ecology skills, and they actually get to create their own ecosystem.\" The ecosystem sandbox functions in the same way that raids do in traditional MMOs, offering infinitely replayable content. And Tropf plans to continue expanding the game via a series of educational modules. \"Although I love games, it's not simply a game,\" Tropf says. \"We want it to be expandable, allowing us to extend how much players can learn from games in general, and how we can extend the impact and reach that--right now--educational games don't have, even though in theory they could.\" It's taken a year of development for the studio to lay the groundwork of Tyto Online, including the MMO infrastructure, the story, the base game world, and the mechanics--not to mention the tools needed to build out modules iteratively and more quickly, making it easier, and faster, to start scaling up content. \"It's kind of interesting how indie developers are building MMOs in smaller pieces now,\" Tropf says. \"There's a handful of projects doing that--launching it with one module and then just building it out. We did it in a way that we'd be able to do that, and have it still make sense with the story.\" But while developers have a wealth of best practices and guides available in all corners of the Internet, the team at Immersed Games found the learning curve for game development to be significantly steeper. \"Building an MMO as a young team of developers has been very interesting in and of itself. There's a lot of proprietary information in game development,\" Tropf explains, which has made it a little challenging to figure out some best practices. \"I'm sure Blizzard has the most amazing toolsets and quest-authoring suites, but it's not like we can see it,\" she adds. \"So we're figuring out all those things on our own.\" However, they were smart enough not to leap right into the online massively multiplayer world. \"Some big studios, such as EA and Zynga, told us that we were insane to try and make an MMO for our first project, and that we really needed to learn from something a bit smaller,\" Tropf says. \"So we actually took part of our game--the create your own ecosystem sandbox--and we released it as its own game called Tyto Ecology, which just marked its one-year anniversary. As a separate game module, Tropf and her team were able to answer a lot of pressing development questions, including identifying the core of the game, where the players engaged most, what they liked, and what they were learning from the gameplay--all before adding the module into the online game, where it is now. This made the foundation of Tyto Online even stronger. Above: Cute creatures inhabit the different ecological biomes. \"Tyto Ecology was a pretty age-agnostic, create-your-own-ecosystem builder. So we tossed it on Steam, and we got five thousand sales in a week just from that,\" Tropf says. \"But we were targeting 9- to 14-year-olds; where do you find them? It's a little bit different if you're not so traditional.\" In terms of what the company is trying to accomplish with the game, Tyto Online is an outlier. Traditional edtech investors weren't comfortable with the fact that Immersed Games wanted to sell to consumers, seeing it as just a commercial video game. And, according to Tropf, commercial video-game industry types are more focused on VR or mobile right now and don't really love selling to kids--because you don't have whales with kids. \"We kind of underestimated that challenge, because the first game sold pretty easily on Steam. But not a lot of 9- to 14-year-olds hang out on Steam, except for some really hardcore gamer ones,\" she says. \"You pretty much just market to their parents, but it's expensive to reach them.\" Immersed Game's focus now is testing both consumer and school sales, and talking to some potential partners that can help them reach each, pushing on both channels to learn which one will get their game in front of the right people, at the right time. Right now, the ecology module of Tyto Online has approximately 40 quests; future modules will have about the same number, depending on the subject, with a sandbox for each of them. By the time they finish the next two modules over the next six months (genetics and entrepreneurship), and leave early access, there will be nearly an unlimited amount of game play, depending on how much time each player wants to spend creating ecosystems, breeding animals in the genetics module, and crafting and sewing items in the entrepreneurship series of quests. But that's just the start. Nearly an infinite number of educational possibilities can be transformed into story quests and sandboxes. \"Picture that, just continuing to expand, so that in the long run, you end up with a massive MMO over many areas of subjects that kids can play for years and learn lots of different subjects,\" Tropf says. \"We see this as the start of a game-based learning platform, and so ideally our long term goal is that you can learn pretty much anything in it--so I don't really see a stopping point for us.\" Sponsored posts are content that has been produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they're always clearly marked.

    "content": "(Reuters) -- Uber has threatened to fire an engineer accused by Alphabet's self-driving Waymo unit of stealing confidential documents in a high profile trade secrets case between the two companies, according to a court filing. Waymo sued ride services company Uber Technologies alleging that former Waymo executive Anthony Levandowski downloaded over 14,000 confidential documents before leaving Waymo to subsequently join Uber. The case, which pits two companies battling to dominate the fast-growing field of self-driving cars, hinges on Waymo allegations that the information Levandowski took made its way into Uber's Lidar system, a key sensor technology in self-driving cars. U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco last week issued an injunction ordering Uber to keep Levandowski away from work involving the self-driving car technology at issue in the case, to prevent him and all other employees from using the materials and to return them to Waymo by May 31. Uber has told Levandowski that he must comply with the order to return Waymo documents or face possible termination, Levandowski's lawyers said in a court filing on Thursday. The lawyers asked the judge to modify his order so that Uber is not required to fire Levandowski if the engineer asserts his constitutional rights against self-incrimination and refuses to produce documents. Uber representatives could not immediately be reached for comment on Levandowski's filing, and a Waymo spokesman declined to comment. Earlier on Thursday Uber said it would appeal a judge's order rejecting its attempt to arbitrate Waymo's trade secret claims, according to a court filing. Alsup last week ruled that Waymo's lawsuit should not be heard in a private forum, and instead should continue to be litigated in San Francisco federal court. Levandowski left Waymo in January 2016 and started Otto, a self-driving truck startup that Uber bought for $680 million in August. He had until last month run Uber's self-driving car division, before stepping aside from those responsibilities pending the court case. Uber has not denied that Levandowski took Waymo documents, but says it has not used any Waymo technology in its cars. In his injunction order, Alsup said \"few\" of Waymo's alleged trade secrets have been traced to Uber's self-driving car technology, and that Waymo's patent claims against Uber have proved meritless.

    "content": "Trusted is expanding beyond the San Francisco Bay Area, bringing its on-demand child care service to the New York City market. The company also launched a program aimed at addressing the lack of available child care in the workplace, allowing employees to use it as a corporate benefit. Started by Anand Iyer and Vivian Chan in 2015, Trusted can be thought of as the Uber for babysitting. However, rather than getting just any person to watch your kids, the company uses background and DMV checks, along with reviews of terrorist and sex offender registries, to ensure that the right people are selected to take care of your loved ones. As the company told VentureBeat when it launched, the idea is simple: Find someone reliable and safe to watch your children when you need them. Trusted is going to be the intermediary to help arrange everything. Trusted is now available in Manhattan and Brooklyn, with specific neighborhoods including the Upper West Side, Lincoln Square, Clinton, Hell's Kitchen, Chelsea, Murray Hill, Tribeca, Downtown Brooklyn, Cobble Hill, Williamsburg, Financial District, DUMBO, Greenwich Village, the East Village, and SoHo. The addition of these two boroughs gives the company two of the largest markets in the United States. \"My team and I are so excited to bring Trusted to New York City -- one of the greatest, and busiest, cities in the world. We can't wait to work hand-in-hand with the City's vast pool of talented providers to help parents feel at ease leaving their children, whether they are going to the office or simply want an evening out,\" Iyer said in a statement. In addition to the expansion, Trusted is launching a program that would allow working parents to use the service as part of their employee benefits. It offers backup or emergency child care in case of a sick child or when school is closed, regular or part-time care, and pickups and drop-offs. Eventually, the company plans on expanding the service to include on-site child care in the workplace. The idea behind Trusted at Work is to provide peace of mind not only to employers, but employees. With the former, the program could minimize the amount of time a parent is away from the office because of family issues while also providing a good recruitment tool showing that they care about their employees' families -- an issue that Apple is finding itself facing criticism about. Parents and prospective parents will feel happier about their job knowing their employer cares about families, likely reducing stress around productivity and life in general. Trusted has raised $1.1 million in seed funding, but just added another million to that round from investors like Naval Ravikant and CrunchFund. ",

    "content": "An unusual challenge: Grow the value of a customer base that's been hit with a windstorm of record-breaking engagement. The savvy solution: The most transformative technology to come along in years: artificial intelligence. For Nick Rockwell, CTO of the New York Times -- and a featured speaker at MB 2017 coming up July 11-12 -- AI is foundational to his game plan to blow up the digital Times until it blots out the sky. His team is leveraging analytics and machine learning to create the kind of personalization strategies that can grow an audience hungry for more. It all started during last year's presidential election, when a screaming, tantrum-throwing orangutan raced against arguably the most qualified candidate to ever throw their hat in the presidential ring. The public was horrified, fascinated, terrified -- and hooked. In the wake of the new normal, readership of The New York Times skyrocketed. Though the electoral winner makes continuous claims that the media giant is \"failing,\" the numbers tell a different story. During the last three months of 2016, the Times gained 276,000 net digital-only subscribers -- or more digital subscriptions in three months than in all of 2013 and 2014 combined. Digital advertising revenue, which makes up about 42 percent of the Times's total revenue, rose 10.9 percent to $77.6 million in the quarter. And Nick Rockwell, the minty-fresh brand-new CTO of the New York Times, was handed unprecedented success, but also one of the biggest challenges of his career: Keeping that momentum alive while killing the always-lurking specter of churn. Join Rockwell along with leaders from Coca-Cola, Airbnb, Pandora, IBM, Walmart, and other chieftains of AI at MB 2017 in San Francisco, July 11-12. Register by May 19 to get 50% off early bird pricing.  Another facet of the challenge: The Times is a subscription-first business, which means they're not interested in maximizing clicks, selling low-margin advertising, or winning a pageviews arms race. Unlike some digital-first publications, the often-maligned, puzzlingly successful clickbait headline strategy isn't going to do the trick. This means the appointment of Rockwell to CTO and the ascendence of AI could not be better synchronized. Yes, traffic to the NYT is breaking records, but it still takes three to five years to turn a casual reader into a subscriber -- and AI is now the secret sauce for accelerating that. Rockwell's been redefining what's possible in the digital world since AOL CDs were a valuable commodity. In the mid-90s at the media startup, SonicNet, he helped destroy the limits of what online video technology was capable of, which caught the eye of MTV Networks. He served as senior vice president and CTO of digital media and digital technology at MTV, went on to become a tech leader at numerous startups, as well as the CTO at both TheLadders.com and Conde Nast. In 2015, when Rockwell was tapped to become the New York Times Company's CTO, it signaled a seismic shift in the media company's focus: The future would be digital. You don't meaningfully evolve an iconic brand without taking risks. \"We've historically been conservative as CTOs and CIOs,\" Rockwell said in a recent interview.  \"We've been trained to keep the lights on and make sure nothing breaks. It's defensive and oriented towards future-proofing, and maximizing ROI. But we need to get super aggressive and adopt new technology.\" Rockwell will be talking exactly about that at this year's MB 2017 as well as sharing innovative strategies and insights he's picked up from his time in the trenches. It's time to move from just-a-trend, AI as flavor du jour, into actionable strategies that transform how business is done.   ",

    "content": "Following years of stubbornly high unemployment in France, the country's entrepreneurs believe they have a solution: reinvent the way people are hired. While it seems like there are a million ways to find a job or recruit employees online these days, investors appear surprisingly bullish about these newbies. So much so that three different French human resource-related startups announced new rounds of venture capital this week. Mostly likely, it's a coincidence. Still, it's a sign that entrepreneurs believe technology can help bring down the country's 9.3 percent unemployment rate. That's down from 10.1 percent a couple of years ago, but high enough that many French still remain anxious about their future, and a growing number are deciding to look for economic opportunities abroad. In trying to address the employment problem in France, however, these companies believe they can build businesses that cross borders to become international successes. On Monday, EasyRECrue announced it had raised $8.9 million. Launched in 2013, the company is building a video interviewing platform aimed at helping recruiters weed through large pools of prospective candidates. Investors include Elaia Partners and BPIFrance. On Tuesday, JobTeaser, a job site for university students and young adults, landed $16.7 million from Alven Capital, Idinvest Partners, and Korelya Capital. This is a particularly attractive market in France because the official Youth Unemployment Rate (for people 25 years old and younger) is 23.70 percent, down from its recent peak of 25.6 percent in November 2012 but above its historic average of 20.15 percent. Finally, on Wednesday Talent.io said it had raised $8.9 million from Ventech and Alven Capital. The company had raised $2.5 million in 2015 from those same two firms, with the addition of Elaia Partners and a syndicate of angels. We'll see how far these startups can travel beyond France. But no doubt new French president Emmanuel Macron, a big startup booster, will welcome any help in getting the country's economy moving again. ",

It used two Renault Kangoo vehicles driving over embedded pads in the road that transferred a charge to the cars' batteries at up to 20 kilowatts at highway speeds. Experts believe that self-driving cars of tomorrow will be electric and require a way to charge themselves without human intervention. Wireless charging is an important area of research for carmakers, their suppliers and start-ups like Chargepoint, WiTricity and HEVO Power. Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android phone makers and Apple Inc, is on track to become the leading supplier to the fast-growing automotive chips market given its pending $38 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors. European Union regulators are to rule by June 9 on the deal, which would be the semiconductor industry's biggest to date. Electric vehicle charging is one area where Qualcomm could grow as it strives to reduce its dependence on a cooling smartphone market. Qualcomm Chief Executive Steven Mollenkopf has called automotive technology and Internet of Things -- in which household objects like cars and refrigerators communicate -- a \"tremendous opportunity\" for the company.

    "content": "Social Native has created a marketplace for connecting brands with content creators who can create authentic social media assets that promote those brands. And that, in turn, has enabled Social Native to raise $8 million from investors, including SoftBank Capital. The Los Angeles startup has positioned itself for the era known as the \"creator economy,\" a term coined by futurist Paul Saffo to describe our shift from consumers of content to creators of content. Social Native works with top brands to find them low-cost and authentic content. In this age of social media, brands haven't been able to keep up with the voracious demand for social media assets, such as videos or pictures, on all of the big social sites. So the company enlists people who create an enormous number of assets: the fans. Those fans currently don't get paid for their authentic expressions of enthusiasm for a brand, and brands can select the kind of content they want, such as fans interacting with a new product. Social Native uses its algorithms to identify creators, and then invites them to create content for the brand. Creators are always paid for the content they create, and this content is always created on demand, not found and surfaced for the brand. The brands pay Social Native for the assets, and Social Native shares that money with the content creators who express their love for the products. By contrast, an ad agency might charge $100 million for 100 campaigns. But content creators, who were previously sharing for free, could be far less expensive, and their content could be a lot more effective because it's so authentic. Social Native said it received extensive interest from investors after its early success creating content for brands like Polaroid, Walgreens, and General Motors. \"We're pleased to see continued and growing interest in our technology across the globe,\" said Social Native CEO David Shadpour, in a statement. \"Brand's are faced with the challenge of creating high volumes of personalized content to deliver relevant customer experiences, and prior to Social Native, this was a seemingly impossible task. It's exciting to see the impact Social Native is having on the digital marketing landscape and the interest not just from brands, but also the investor community.\" The new funding will enable Social Native to double down on its investment in the Content Optimization Engine. It will also further the company's mission of using technology to reimagine the creative industry while investing in sales and marketing to continue claiming market share. \"Brands are trying to keep up with the demand to create relevant customer experiences for all marketing channels,\" said Jordan Levy, general partner at SoftBank Capital NY, in a statement. \"This demand for personalized content has created a huge market opportunity for Social Native. They have the team, technology, and vision needed to transform the industry. And now [they have] the results. The company is producing astounding metrics for brands by automating the traditionally manual process of content creation.\" Two industry veterans who invested in Social Native later joined the executive team full time. One is Jeff Ragovin, chief growth officer at Social Native, who cofounded Buddy Media, which sold for $745 million to Salesforce. The other, Eytan Elbaz, chief strategy officer at Social Native, is famed for cocreating AdSense, which was bought by Google for $104 million. \"Social Native's technology is unparalleled in content marketing,\" said Jeff Ragovin, in a statement. \"Not only have we completely automated the creative development process, but we're building technology that will create a fundamental shift in how brands think about content creation.\" ",

    "content": "The Metaverse(tm), as brought to you by Big Bad Mega-Conglomerate(r). It's one of Tim Sweeney's big nightmares for the future of virtual reality. The Epic Games CEO spoke about this at our recent GamesBeat Summit. He worries that the major platforms will want to lock down key advancements in virtual reality, to the point that the concept of the massive virtual worlds we see in works like Ready Player One will only become reality thanks to one company's tech. It's a fair concern. Sweeney has been raising red flags about Microsoft's potential to close off Windows for some time now, so it's natural that he'd have his eyes on keeping future platforms open as well. It's key to Epic's business, since it provides a game engine (Unreal) for developing on just about every game platform (along with selling games, too). Oculus has it own store for games, but Steam is also there, selling plenty of VR titles from just about everybody in the business. But is this a realistic fear at this point of VR development? Just this past week, we saw Microsoft show off new gear, Oculus give VR devs more support, and Vivid Vision raise more than $2 million to use VR tools in health care. We're seeing tons of action, on many fronts, in this young but growing sector. But to continue that growth and keep it open, we need to heed Sweeney's words and watch out for anyone trying to monopolize the metaverse. For AR/VR coverage, send news tips to Dean Takahashi and Jeff Grubb (for those that cross over into PC gaming). Please send guest post submissions to Rowan Kaiser. Please be sure to visit our AR/VR Channel. --Jason Wilson, GamesBeat managing editor P.S. Science fiction continues to influence how tech, including VR, evolves.  Oculus is pumping up support for its developer site Facebook wants to get better at helping its Oculus Rift developers. The virtual reality division of the social-networking behemoth announced today that it has collaborated with its development community to find out what resources it needs to provide to empower creativity in the people making VR experiences. In a blog post, Oculus explained that it [...] Epic Games' Tim Sweeney fears the Metaverse will be a proprietary technology Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, believes the future of gaming is coming faster than we think. But he's also worried that industry giants will try too hard to own the platforms upon which those games are built, and that will lead to toll booths, a lack of open standards, and a loss of privacy. [...] Vreal CEO Todd Hooper on the joys of VR livestreaming Todd Hooper has shown up early at the virtual reality party. He started Vreal in Seattle to create a livestreaming platform for streamers to broadcast their gameplay in VR to spectators. It's like Twitch, the livestreaming platform for PC gamers, and it is one of the ways that virtual reality will become more social.

Even though the PlayStation VR (PSVR) headset released several months ago in mid-October, it felt more like a soft launch until recently. And finally, Farpoint feels like the big splash fans have been waiting for -- although it isn't as great as it could have been. (via UploadVR) PSVR Aim Controller Review: Feel The Game Like Never Before After VR headsets started coming out though I had to get used to having a clunky add-on around really quickly. But now that we're a full year into the life cycle of the consumer VR market peripherals for add-ons (such as the PlayStation VR (PSVR) Aim Controller for the PSVR itself) are now a thing and the amount of space they take up is more than doubled.But don't worry. I'm here to tell you that the PSVR Aim Controller is, despite the odds, an extra hunk of plastic all PSVR owners are gonna want to have lying around the house. (via UploadVR) Let's Prove the Future is Female and Alter Reality One of the biggest hurdles that women entrepreneurs face is access to funds and the solid support that is needed when the growth stage of a business comes. We're hoping to help solve that for the VR/AR industry along with a coalition of industry players. These organizations include venture, corporate, media and startup partners dedicated to elevating women founders and offering capital and support resources to advance their startups. (via VR Scout) Where are the Daydream VR phones Google promised? When Google announced the Daydream virtual reality platform at its 2016 I/O conference, the system was pitched as a core feature of Android Nougat, with strong support from manufacturers. Almost every major Android phone maker was supposed to be releasing a Daydream-ready phone, which would work with any Daydream-compatible mobile headset. But one year later, the platform is still niche, and a lot of these partners have been keeping quiet about their plans. (via The Verge) and receive this newsletter every Wednesday ",

His hiring comes five years after leaving Greylock for Wealthfront where he initially served as chief operating officer before taking over the helm as chief executive. He's also credited with identifying the startup for the VC firm. Greylock partner Reid Hoffman wrote in a Medium post: \"Adam is a world-class executive and product-builder. In addition to his work at Wealthfront, he has played a pivotal role and left a mark on massive tech companies, including LinkedIn, eBay, and Apple, where he built and scaled several key products and managed global teams.\" After being CEO of the firm for three years, Nash resigned in October 2016. Now he's rejoining Greylock once again as an executive-in-residence. For entrepreneurs, his expertise could prove invaluable as they scale their product, teams, or business in general. It could also provide Nash time to figure out what his next move will be -- maybe becoming CEO of another portfolio company? Hoffman described Nash's second coming as a \"great fit\" for the firm as it continues to shore up talent that has built companies or has gone \"from startup to scaleup.\" Other additions have included Twitter's former vice president of product Josh McFarland, who joined as a partner in December.

Xbox and the popular Battle Royale-like online shooter PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds are joining the PC Gaming Show at E3. At 10 a.m. Pacific time on Monday, June 12, PC Gamer (a magazine and website that covers computer gaming) will take over The Theater at the Ace hotel in Los Angeles for an event that will feature news from Intel, Arma developer Bohemia Interactive, and more. This shows how Microsoft is attempting to further its presence in the PC-gaming space. The company has backed off a console-first approach, and it now says that it doesn't care where you buy its games because it's more interested in getting you to use Xbox Live. Microsoft is planning to have \"leaders\" and game developers from its Xbox team on the show's stage to talk about what the company is doing with PC gaming. The company will also talk about its Beam livestreaming video service. \"PC gaming is a huge part of our gaming ecosystem -- across Windows, Beam, and Xbox,\" Xbox marketing boss Mike Nichols said. \"The PC Gaming Show is the perfect place for us to talk about what's next from Xbox for PC gamers.\" Developer Bluehole will give its more than 2 million PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds players news and updates about where that shooter is headed. That game is the latest massive Early Access success on Steam, and fans are eager to hear more about what the studio is planning to do with its recent influx of millions of dollars. Other games and companies that are headed to The PC Gaming Show include tactical mech combat sim Battletech from Paradox Interactive. Developer Creative Assembly will bring its Total War: Warhammer II strategy game on behalf of publisher Sega. And startup indie publisher Raw Fury Games are planning to participate as well. ",

    "content": "CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that burst onto the national scene during the U.S. election season last year when it became the first to pin a data breach at the Democratic National Committee on Russia, said on Wednesday that it has closed a $100 million funding round at a valuation exceeding $1 billion. The new round has propelled the firm into the rarified ranks of the \"unicorn\" club, the group of startups valued at a billion dollars or more. The company has raised $256 million to date. The latest fundraising was led by Accel, a venture capital firm based in Palo Alto, Calif. that also participated in two of CrowdStrike's earlier funding rounds. Joining the latest round were new investors March Capital Partners, a year-old VC firm based in Santa Monica, Calif., and Telstra, Australia's biggest telecom company and an early CrowdStrike customer, as well as existing investors CapitalG (formerly Google Capital) and Warburg Pincus. Founded six years ago, CrowdStrike has made a name for itself investigating some of the world's biggest data breaches and calling out nation-state sponsored hacker groups in the process. The startup helped build a case that North Korea digitally pummeled Sony Pictures in 2014, that China orchestrated a ransacking of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in 2015, and that Russian intelligence agencies masterminded the DNC breach last year. George Kurtz, CrowdStrike's cofounder and CEO, told Fortune that he's pushing a \"cloud-first\" model for security, meaning that customers subscribe to install lightweight software agents on computers that gather intelligence on inbound attacks, and then CrowdStrike bakes protections into its product based on its learnings. Kurtz looks to Salesforce's cloud-based subscription strategy, which has displaced the once-uncontested giant Siebel in the market for sales software, as a guide. CrowdStrike, although not yet profitable, is aiming to go into the black in the next fiscal year, according to a spokesperson. The company declined to reveal its revenue figures, but said that it has an annual revenue run rate -- a fuzzy yardstick that extrapolates sales for the year based on current figures -- exceeding $100 million for 2017. Since raising a prior $100 million in a round led by CapitalG in July 2015, CrowdStrike has added about 390 employees and grown from four offices in the U.S. to 15 worldwide, including in new markets such as Europe and the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. Sameer Gandhi, a partner at the venture capital firm Accel who spearheaded the recent funding (and who was integral in Accel's investment in the e-commerce firm Jet, which Wal-Mart acquired last year for more than $3 billion), said that his firm \"wanted to double down\" on CrowdStrike, believing that it has the potential to occupy a position in the market for security products that was once the sole domain of incumbents like Symantec and McAfee. In fact, CEO Kurtz is the former chief technology officer of McAfee, and his co-founder and chief technology officer Dmitri Alperovitch is McAfee's former head of threat research. Gandhi said that he first got in touch with CrowdStrike years ago when he was scoping out candidates that might become big players in the endpoint security market, where businesses sell software to protect computers. \"I flew to Orange County to meet [Kurtz] because he offered me a 20 minute slot,\" Gandhi said, noting that Kurtz seemed initially skeptical of Gandhi's interest. That meeting lasted an hour and a half, and eventually led to their business partnership. CrowdStrike is known for nicknaming the hacker groups it tracks with seemingly silly names, like \"Fancy Bear\" (Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU) and \"Clever Kitten\" (affiliates of the Islamic Republic of Iran). The company's newly acquired unicorn title is, as such, a fitting one. This story originally appeared on Fortune.com. Copyright 2017 ",

    "content": "Agile software testing company QASymphony has raised $40 million in a series C round of funding led by New York's Insight Venture Partners. Founded out of Atlanta, Georgia in 2011, QASymphony offers a range of testing and quality assurance (QA) tools designed to improve efficiency and collaboration during the entire software testing phase. Its flagship QTest platform, which can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, enables dev teams to organize their testing schedule and activities while serving up charts and graphs that highlight where the main problems lie. The company claims around 400 customers -- including Salesforce, Cisco, Adobe, Samsung, and Verizon -- in 20 countries. Above: QTest Up until now, QASymphony had raised around $7.5 million in funding, and this latest cash influx will allow it to \"accelerate product development\" and expedite its global growth. \"With this Series C, we plan to aggressively invest in expanding our product leadership and in growing our global sales, marketing, and customer success teams to drive greater market share in North America and Europe,\" said QASymphony CEO Dave Keil. The global software testing market will be a $34 billion industry in 2017, according to analyst Nelson Hall, and we've seen a number of companies operating in this realm nab some big funding of late. In the past few months alone, OverOps raised $30 million to help developers debug code and Austria's Tricentis closed a mammoth $165 million round. And last year, \"in the wild\" app-testing startup Applause closed a $35 million round, while San Francisco's Sauce Labs raised $70 million. \"We believe that this market will grow rapidly over the next several years, and we are confident that QASymphony will emerge as one of the key market leaders in the space,\" added Insight Venture Partners' vice president Philip Vorobeychik.

A responsive mobile website -- that's do or die. But an app is some next-level action. You get your hands on all the features a smartphone can deliver -- geo-awareness, more sophisticated touchscreen applications, the camera, the gyroscope, and more -- and you're delivering a precisely customized, personalized experience. And yet. When something hitches on your mobile site and isn't loading, your user might blame their wireless connection or their cell signal. But when your app isn't up to speed, your customer is going to lay the blame right where it belongs. Mobile app success is inextricably tied to performance, and there's no cutting the cord. Consumers expect to get exactly what they want, exactly when they want it. A slow-loading app hurts your brand image. It gets your app deleted. It directly impacts your ratings. And sales and revenue will follow your user out the door. How slow is too slow? Increasingly, even just fractions of a second too slow turns customers off. One mobile app user survey found that 80 percent of app users retry a slow-loading app only three times or less. Thirty-six percent said that an app with performance issues dropped their opinion of that company like a rock. But how do you consistently deliver that rapid-fire response to users when they tap on your icon? And when an issue pops up, how do you fix it before it affects and potentially alienates whole swaths of your audience? It's a tough balancing act between delivering rich content and letting players enjoy the your content without a painful loading screen. In our latest VB Live event, Stewart Rogers, director of marketing technology at VentureBeat, will  take a deep dive into the best practices for reducing load times across both the mobile web and apps.

    "content": "Since Regulation Crowdfunding began on May 16 last year, 335 companies have filed offering documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to fundraise on securities-based crowdfunding platforms. Of those companies, 43 percent were funded, 30 percent failed, and the remainder are still open and trying to get funding. The total capital committed to date on these platforms is in excess of $40 million, with the average successful crowdfunding campaign raising around $282,000 from about 312 investors. The most recent quarter saw the greatest number of companies file with the SEC. This signals that issuers might finally be catching on to the opportunity that Regulation Crowdfunding holds. Above: Four quarters of growth in the number of issuers (companies launching an equity crowdfunding campaign) And what about the portals that have emerged to host these fundraises? Of the 26 portals registered with FINRA to help companies sell Regulation Crowdfunding securities, nine have already closed, gone out of business, or been shut down. Of those remaining, Wefunder (based in San Francisco and Massachusetts) is leading the pack both in the number of deals and total dollars raised. They have been in business since Regulation Crowdfunding went into effect and have helped 63 companies pull in almost $18 million. Start Engine (in Los Angeles) ranks second with 27 campaigns funded, and Microventures (Austin), NextSeed (Houston), SeedInvest (New York), and Republic (New York) rank third through sixth. Interestingly, the location of these platforms also matches the states that have raised the most capital.  Several platforms (both old and new) have only funded a handful of campaigns. This may signal that brand awareness and marketing by the larger incumbents is driving both companies seeking capital and investors looking for deal flow. However, If you dig a little deeper and look at the capital raised during the last three quarters, you will see in that while Wefunder is leading in overall dollars, both Microventures and Start Engine are not far behind in terms of quarterly commitments (see Orange bar to compare Q1, 17 results).  Microventures, the offshoot of rewards-based crowdfunding platform Indiegogo only launched at the end of last year and is already showing strong results, with 100 percent campaign success. While the platform hasn't run many campaigns, the campaigns it has run have raised slightly more success than those on Wefunder.  I expect to see Indiegogo put more time and energy into converting its most successful rewards campaigns into equity campaigns on Microventures. This will make them a strong contender in the marketplace. Start Engine, with its strong performance in the transportation, software and entertainment/media sectors will also be a strong contender, as will Republic, the offshoot of Angelist and SeedInvest. If you are a startup looking to crowdfund, you are likely most interested in success rates. While Wefunder has the most deals and raised the most money in aggregate, it holds second place in terms of the average raise per successful campaign. Microventures took the prize with $286,334. For the moment this is a competitive advantage as Microventures moves from its go-to-market strategy to its market expansion one. Nonetheless, Start Engine and SeedInvest aren't far behind and will most likely be appealing to startups as well. Now that the industry is a year old and has seen steady growth with relatively few mishaps, I expect the next year to be even more competitive. Wefunder got out of the gate strong, but can it stand up to the portals that have deep-pocket VCs behind them? Sherwood Neiss is a partner at Crowdfund Capital Advisors. Neiss helped lead the U.S. fight to legalize debt and equity based crowdfunding, coauthored Crowdfund Investing for Dummies, and cofounded Crowdfund Capital Advisors, where he provides strategy and technology services to those seeking to benefit from crowdfund investing. Neiss and Jason Best are credited as the fathers of Title III of the JOBS Act. After attending the bill-signing ceremony at the White House, they formed Crowdfund Capital Advisors to study what is happening in crowdfunding, analyze results, report trends, and follow opportunities. They are active investors in the crowd finance space. ",

    "content": "Presented by K-Startup Grand Challenge 2017 Last August, PK Mishra boarded a Korea-bound plane from San Francisco, along with his co-founder at Fingertips Lab, Ben Park. After a successful crowdfunding campaign for their in-car Bluetooth controller, Mishra and Park, who spent his early years in Korea, needed a manufacturer that could meet their demands for precision and quality. \"The O6 control dial needs to look and feel at home in a luxury car. Most OEMs can't handle our demands or give us confidence in their manufacturing process. The ones in Korea are a cut above,\" Park said. What's notable in this story isn't that Fingertips Lab found an OEM in Korea. Thousands of companies do that each year. It's that the Korean government paid their team to come to Seoul for three months of expenses-paid acceleration, investor matchmaking and mentoring, as part of a program called the K-Startup Grand Challenge. In its inaugural year, the government-backed accelerator selected 40 startups looking to expand in Asia. Since then, those companies have secured over $5.5M in local and international investments, signed 30 contracts and 120 MOUs, and filed numerous patents. A striking 70 percent established a legal entity in Korea and 80 percent had a local member join their team during the program. Fingertips Lab went on to win first place at the program's demo day, receiving a $100,000 grant and follow-on investment from 500 Startups and local angels. They also opened negotiations with Hyundai Motors, the world's fourth-largest automaker, along with Korea-based distributors. Through June 7th, organizers are accepting applications for batch two of the K-Startup Grand Challenge.  Apply for the K-Startup Grand Challenge This year they've expanded the program to include 50 startups and four months of acceleration. Startups selected will receive $12,000 to cover living expenses over four months, plus funding towards round-trip flights to Korea. Non-financial incentives include office space and prototyping facilities in a $160 million startup campus, located within walking distance of many Korean tech giants like Kakao and Naver, and a 14 minute subway ride from Gangnam. \"Our time in Korea was more valuable than I could have guessed,\" said Jazz Tan, Founder and CEO of Malaysia-based startup YouthsToday. During her stay in Korea, Tan signed agreements with numerous universities and student organizations, giving her access to more than 600,000 university students in Korea. This gave YouthsToday, a platform that helps students secure corporate sponsorship for events, its first foothold in a foreign country. \"As a startup, we couldn't have afforded the cost or risk of expansion without the support the Korean government provided,\" Tan said. \"We were even able to hire a local manager and an intern to look after the business in Korea when I returned to Malaysia.\" Preksh, the runner up at the 2016 Demo Day, registered a patent in Korea for its unique augmented reality solution and are in the process of signing a deal with a major retailer, which serves more than one million shoppers per week. Fourth place winner, Imagga makes a powerful image recognition API. While in Korea they collaborated with KIA Motors and they are still leveraging the network formed during the program to grow their business in Asia. Nathan Millard, whose company, G3 Partners, is working to support the K-Startup Grand Challenge, has witnessed the development of Korea's startup ecosystem over the past five years. \"When I started working with Korean startups in 2012, there were few signs that Seoul had potential as a regional startup hub. Just a few years later there's a thriving ecosystem and some great local success cases, in part fueled by support from both the private and public purse,\" he explained. Millard believes that Korea serves as an optimal test market for expansion in Asia, thanks to a confluence of factors. \"Korea is safe and stable. Koreans are tech-savvy and open to foreign brands. Korea also provides easy access to over 2 billion potential customers in Asia just a short flight away,\" he said. \"And did I mention that Korea boasts the among the world's fastest mobile internet speeds and that 88% of Koreans own a smartphone?\" Korea is also home to global brands like Samsung, LG and Hyundai who have signed on to support K-Startup Grand Challenge. On account of the nation's manufacturing heritage tech talent is abundant and 64% of Koreans hold a university degree. This presents startups with a fertile recruiting ground. Bloomberg also ranked Korea No. 1 in its annual innovation lists in 2015 and 2016. Tech startups that are less than five years old and have an MVP (minimum viable product), can apply online for this year's K-Startup Grand Challenge by June 7. The program kicks off in the fall.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Founded out of Riga in 2012, Infogram offers a slick WYSIWYG editor that converts users' data into infographics that can be published or embedded elsewhere. The company claims three million users and has raised around $2 million since its inception. It has made one prior acquisition itself, when it snapped up Brazil-based data-visualization blog Visualoop back in 2014. Prezi has emerged as one of Hungary's best-known startup exports and has built a solid reputation for its slick presentation-building platform. With 85 million users and $70 million in funding under its belt, Prezi now calls San Francisco home. While Prezi is better known for its \"zoomable\" canvas that lets users plot and easily visualize the various components of a presentation, bringing Infogram on board is way to open businesses and individuals \"to the more artful side of presentations,\" according to a statement issued by the company. \"Prezi was inspired to unite with Infogram because of our shared mission to help people make better decisions by providing more effective tools for visual communication,\" explained Prezi CEO and cofounder Peter Arvai. \"If a picture is worth a thousand words, then the data that backs it up makes it credible. And without a story, data falls flat in effectiveness.\" Infogram actually represents Prezi's first ever acquisition in its nine-year history, and as a result of the deal Infogram will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Prezi, though it will remain based in the Latvian capital.

    "content": "London-based venture capital firm Notion Capital has closed its third fund, Notion Capital III LP, at $140m (PS107 million). The fund's closure comes almost two years after it was first announced at $120 million, and at the time Notion noted that it planned to grow the fund to $150 million by the end of 2015. As announced previously, the pot of cash will go toward enterprise-focused SaaS and cloud startups based in Europe. Notable new investors include Cisco's VC arm, Cisco Investments, as well as Emory and Texas A&M university endowments in the U.S. and Ireland's Key Capital. Alongside Notion Capital III, the company also revealed a brand new, separate $80 million (PS60 million) fund, Notion Capital Opportunities LP, that will be used for later-stage follow-on funding for its existing portfolio of startups. It's a fairly flexible fund, meaning it can go toward \"the best performing\" companies in its existing cohort of companies from across all three venture funds. Founded in 2009, Notion Capital was set up by brothers Ben and Jos White after selling their company, MessageLabs, to Symantec for $700 million. Notion Capital's two previous funds amounted to around $150 million in total, so today's news more than doubles its resources. Additionally, Notion has also appointed two new partners, Chrys Chrysanthou and Patrick Norris, who have been promoted from other positions within the VC firm. \"We set up Notion in 2009 in the midst of the worst financial crisis in a generation, at a time when the venture asset class remained unproven in Europe,\" explained Notion's managing partner, Stephen Chandler. \"Indeed, our U.S. friends seemed largely dismissive of it. We did this on the back of a very successful exit of our own with MessageLabs, which reinforced our view on the opportunity. The cloud, which sits at the very heart of our investment thesis, means that great entrepreneurs -- of which there are many in Europe! -- can develop, deploy, sell, and support their product globally in ways that were simply not possible a decade ago - and can create huge value in doing so.\" ",

    "content": "Where were you 20 years ago today? If you were Jeff Bezos or a shareholder with enough foresight and confidence to invest in his startup, you were probably celebrating Amazon's IPO, which raised $54 million -- which in turn helped build a $465 billion company. Let's not dwell on the buzzkilling numbers of how much money everyone missed out on by not buying Amazon at $18 a share on May 15, 1997. (If you must know, here's the IPO's investment banker doing the math). There are two other notable things about this anniversary: how absurd the debate that occurred around Amazon's IPO valuation looks now, and how similar it is to the debate that is still taking place today. Amazon initially planned to sell its shares for $13 apiece. Some analysts balked at that price because it valued the company at 20 times sales -- Amazon had made less than $16 million in 1996 and had 180,000 customers. There weren't a lot of internet startups to compare valuations to, so Wall Street opted for brick-and-mortar retailers, which traded around 1 times revenue. At such a high valuation, some predicted Amazon would have trouble selling its shares to investors. After all, its prospectus warned that \"the rate at which such losses will be incurred will increase significantly from current levels, and its recent revenue growth rates are not sustainable and will decrease in the future.\" Instead of bowing to skeptics, Bezos is said to have spent hours on the phone talking the offering price up to $17 a share. When investment bankers argued the IPO could fail if priced too high, Bezos shot back, \"Can you guarantee for me that it will fail at $17?\" When the answer was no, he asked the same question about $18 a share. Amazon shares priced at $18 a share and rose 30 percent on their first day of trading. (Factoring in three stock splits in the late 1990s, Amazon's offering price was $1.50 in today's terms. The stock closed today at $957.57.) By the end of 1997, the company had 1.5 million customers and revenue of $148 million. There were still plenty of skeptics. \"Some people smoke internet inhalant and their judgment gets bizarre,\" said an analyst at Forrester Research about Amazon's IPO. The debate raged, growing louder during the wake of the dot-com bust, but quieting in more recent years as Amazon dominated first ecommerce and eventually cloud computing. In that time, Wall Street has come to accept that Bezos' plan -- shovel today's potential profits into future revenue growth -- could work for Amazon, even if multiple startups since then have tried that same trick and largely failed. Bezos spelled that plan out clearly in his 1997 letter to shareholders, a letter he reprints every single year to underscore Amazon's early and long-term vision. We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital. Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise. What read in 1997 like boilerplate language for an internet startup's annual report looks, with the hindsight of 20 years, more like a bold business plan. It's one that Amazon has fiercely and faithfully executed. The success of the plan can be seen in the growth of its revenue and valuation. Even now, Amazon's stock is trading at 196 times its 2016 earnings. That may still raise some eyebrows, but it's harder to find skeptics who would be willing to bet a lot of money against the company's growth. ",

    "content": "Two of our speakers at GamesBeat Summit 2017 really embodied the confluence of tech, science fiction, and games. Rob Reid, founder of Listen.com and author of science fiction novels such as the upcoming After On, held a fireside with Adam Gazzaley, brain researcher at UCSF and cofounder of Akili Interactive Labs. Their talk was entitled, \"Putting science into science fiction. Literally - and literarily!\" Reid goes to great pains to see that his \"speculative fiction\" is grounded in science. He regularly talks with Gazzaley about the brain, and that helped Reid write his upcoming novel After On, which grapples with issues of digital consciousness. In addition to advising Reid on the novel, Gazzaley is a professor in neurology, physiology and psychiatry at University of California, San Francisco and the founder and executive director of Neuroscape, a translational neuroscience center engaged in technology creation and scientific research. Above: Adam Gazzaley (right) is running Akili Interactive Labs, a startup focused on creating therapeutic video games. Reid sold his Listen.com startup, which created the Rhapsody music service, to Real Networks. And then he became an angel investor. That helped him get the ideas for his prior novel, Year Zero, a New York Times bestseller about how a vast alien civilization becomes obsessed with American pop music bankrupts the entire universe. Reid's new book is more serious, and it focuses on a diabolical social media company called Phlutter. \"As I started writing it, I did start getting a little bit alarmed\" about artificial intelligence becoming too smart, Reid said. He also looked at quantum computing and synthetic biology to help connect all of dots in the book. In writing that book, Reid reached out to Gazzaley asking, \"Where does consciousness come from?\" Above: Rob Reid's After On is about a social network that gains consciousness. Gazzaley is doing research on the \"plasticity of the brain,\" or the ability to change the brain and its functions for the sake of education, wellness, and better aging. His Akili Interactive Labs is trying to create therapeutic video games that can help people deal with problems such as attention deficit disorder. Gazzaley and Reid had a long dinner about consciousness. \"As scientist, to see it formulated and re-created in fiction, and very funny fiction, is a real experience,\" Gazzaley said. In addition to advising Reid, Gazzaley is the scientific adviser for over a dozen technology companies including Apple, GE, Magic Leap and The Void, and he is on the science board of the President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition.

Accern wants to lend some method to the madness by monitoring news sites, blogs, social networks, and more to curate the most relevant financial content. The New York-based startup announced a $1.2 million seed round today to onboard new customers. \"Right now we're working with many multibillion dollar hedge funds and banks to consolidate all their existing news subscriptions feeds into a centralized news platform,\" wrote Accern cofounder and CEO Kumesh Aroomoogan, in an email to VentureBeat. \"We then curate the news using our artificial intelligence technologies to help them find the most relevant stories on stocks they are tracking.\" The company says it tracks more than 300 million websites, social networks like Twitter and Tumblr, and SEC filings in real time. Learn how developers and brand marketers are using AI to grow their businesses, at MB 2017 on July 11-12 in SF. We cut through the hype to show how marketers are achieving real ROI. Get your 50% off Early Bird ticket by May 19! According to Aroomoogan, about a dozen financial institutions are using the platform, typically paying $500 per user per month. Aroomoogan would not disclose customer names but did say there are about 500 active users. Accern isn't alone in providing insights on financial news. Although Dataminr is the most obvious competitor, data services like Reuters and Bloomberg could arguably also be considered competitors. But Aroomoogan disagrees. \"Bloomberg and Reuters are not competitors but a complimentary news service for Accern,\" he wrote. \"A lot of firms are already subscribed to these news sites, and we are basically consolidating that data on our platform.\"  The startup also plans to expand beyond financial services. \"We're looking to build out the platform to help clients understand the buzz around internal controversies,\" Aroomoogan wrote. \"It would be beneficial for a brand like United, who's been under fire recently, to streamline all the messaging and reactions around the incidents.\" He named IBM as the company's first non-financial customer but declined to reveal specifics of the deal. Investors participating in today's round included Rostra Capital, VYL, Gurtin Ventures, 26 Ventures, Belmont Capital, and Affinity Investment Group, as well as several individual angel investors. Accern will be using the new money to hire more data scientists and engineers and to increase the AI capabilities of its platform to monitor more news.

    "content": "Startups put great effort into finding the perfect name. Ideally, it should be short, memorable, descriptive, and easy to pronounce. Names that meet all the criteria are commonly taken, however, so most founders find a compromise. They settle on a creative misspelling, add a word or just string together sounds they like. In the end, the hope is that a well-named startup will have an easier time attracting customers and capital. Observing companies founded and funded in the past couple years, it's apparent that startups are often thinking along the same lines when it comes to choosing a name. They're making reference to hot technologies like AI, opting for two- or three-word names, or simply making up words. \"We're surprised at how many names we can make up that sound like they should be in the dictionary, even if they're not,\" says Athol Foden, founder of Brighter Naming, a corporate naming consultancy. He's also impressed by how many really good names come out of creative combinations of common nouns and verbs. We crunched through names of more than 1,000 startups founded in the past two years to look for trends. We narrowed the query to startups that have raised $200,000 or more in an effort to focus on names of companies that secured investment. Here is a rundown on some of the recent trends. Venture capitalists love artificial intelligence companies lately, and AI is a concise, universally recognized abbreviation. So it's not surprising to see funded startups cropping up with \"AI\" in their names. We counted at least 23 funded companies founded in the past two years that have AI in their names. By far the biggest funding recipient with an AI name is Argo AI, a startup in the ultra-hot autonomous vehicle space that secured a $1 billion investment from Ford in February. Other sizeable rounds went to Aidoc, a provider of AI-powered medical imaging tools for radiologists, and Rulai, which incorporates AI into customer experience software. You might think it would be natural for a robotics company to call itself one. Looking at companies in the space that raised funding recently, that's clearly the trend. Crunchbase records show at least ten companies founded and funded in the past two years with \"robotics\" or \"robot\" in their names. But in previous investment cycles, when the industry was less in vogue with venture capitalists, many companies chose names that didn't reveal their robotics focus. One of the most prominent was Kiva Systems, a developer of robot technology for warehouses that Amazon bought for $775 million five years ago. Others include Harvest Automation and Blue River Technology. Of course, there are also some older companies, such as Roomba-maker iRobot, that chose names reflecting their robotics roots. Giving companies a human first name isn't a new thing in startup circles. Perhaps the best-known startup in this category is Oscar, a four-year-old health insurance company that has raised over $700 million. Lynda.com, an online learning provider that sold to LinkedIn two years ago for $1.5 billion, also follows the first name trend. Perhaps Oscar, Lynda, and, more recently, Viv, served as an inspiration to others. In the past two years, we've seen Albert, Lucy, Ollie, Penny, Pearl, Riley, and Yoshi crop up, among others. Extra points go to Aiden, an AI-powered tool for marketers, for scoring a brand that includes both an AI reference and a popular first name. Apple did pretty well with this strategy. Now others are hoping it'll work for them. We're seeing a number of tech startups turning to the grocery shelves for naming ideas in the past couple years. From the dairy aisle, we have Butter.ai, a digital personal assistant, and Cheddar, an online financial news network that closed a $19 million round this week. Representing the produce section, there's Plum, an online saving tool. And from the bakery, we have Bagel Labs, developer of a smart tape measure, and Donut Media, a startup targeting auto enthusiasts. Is your dream startup name taken? No worries. Just delete the \"i\" and replace it with a \"y,\" change that \"c\" to a \"k,\" or try a different vowel. Those are some popular techniques in creative misspelling that startups are using to secure names that sound like common words. Names featuring a \"y\" in place of \"I\" include Mylestone and Shyft Technologies. For the \"c\" and \"k\" switcheroo, there's Kustomer and Kard. For other catchy typo names, see our list here. As Foden told Crunchbase News, founders' creativity has allowed for a much wider array of catchy startup names than even naming professionals would have thought possible. He'd predicted a few years ago that startups would turn to obscure foreign languages for names; instead. they are still mostly using their native tongues. Startups have also managed to stretch out the name supply by going with two words, Usually, the first name is the brand and the second indicates sector. But according to Foden, the two-word naming trend is likely temporary for founders with big ambitions. Once a company passes the $100 billion valuation mark, it's common to drop the second word. No one calls Cisco Systems anything but Cisco anymore. And as for Apple, most young people probably don't even remember that it used to be Apple Computer. ",

    "content": "Startups in Latin America are using creative solutions to address not just local but also global problems. For investors outside the region, the prospect of working with these startups can appear attractive, yet complicated. Investing in early-stage startups in Latin America can present challenges; however, despite the challenges, time and time again I've found it can be well worth the effort. When I first came to Santiago, Chile in 2010 as part of the pilot round of Start-Up Chile, there was hardly any talk of startups. Most people didn't even know what startups were. Within nine months of returning to the U.S., the company I co-founded was acquired. So I decided to go back to Chile to look for more opportunities in this emerging market. Over the next couple of years, I taught entrepreneurship in Chile, mentored local entrepreneurs and eventually started investing in Latin American companies myself. I've now invested in more than 30 early-stage companies in Latin America, and I firmly believe the time to help early-stage startups in Latin America has never been better. Here's why. Some of the earliest VC firms established in the region, such as NXTP Labs in Argentina and Vox Capital in Brazil, have paved the way for others to find success. In a region that is traditionally very averse to risk and tends to condemn failure, these firms took a chance on budding ventures long before others dreamed of doing so. These pioneer VC firms in the region faced plenty of challenges. First, they had to educate and develop the expectations of local entrepreneurs so that they realized that Latin America is not Silicon Valley, with easy access to venture capital and U.S.-style valuations. But their successes and failures have served as exemplary models for many of the new early-stage funding initiatives we're seeing. As the startup ecosystem in Latin America evolved, the flow and ease of doing early-stage deals improved significantly and encouraged more investment in the region. A look into five-year investment trends in Latin America revealed that investors had closed deals worth $2.3 billion, according to the Latin American Venture Capital Association (LAVCA). In the past few years, we've also started to see VC-backed startups begin to give back to the community and participate as investors themselves, either as angels or limited partners in funds. One example is Colombian-American entrepreneur-turned-investor, Andres Barreto. He launched several startups, including Grooveshark and PulsoSocial, and, in 2012, he started the investment firm Socialatom Ventures. The Colombian firm, which recently raised a second fund called Firstrock Capital, invests in early-stage companies and provides them with resources to grow their companies. The firm is still active and now focuses on early-stage startups that have their technology team in Latin America but whose target market is the U.S. (Disclosure: My firm, Magma Partners, has participated in two co-investments with Socialatom Ventures.) There's no debating that the proliferation of accelerators and local entrepreneurs gaining experience in each of the key startup hubs across Latin America -- such as in Buenos Aires, Santiago and Medellin -- has impacted the region's funding ecosystem as a whole. A 2014 study of accelerators found that just the presence of an accelerator can have an impact on the number of seed and early-stage VC deals in a local startup ecosystem. This \"spillover effect\" is certainly something I've witnessed in Latin America. The growing number of early-stage accelerator programs, such as Start-Up Chile and Wayra, have had a lot to do with putting the region on the map as a hotspot for startup activity. These programs are showing outside investors that Latin America possesses abundant opportunities worth exploring. Startups are disrupting all sectors of the economy, but the main sector of Latin America witnessing the most change is the traditional banking industry. Because there is still such a large unbanked population in the region, fintech startups are discovering plenty of opportunities to succeed. According to Finnovista, the number of fintech startups in the region recently surpassed 1,000. Strategic partners in traditional businesses and regulatory approval from government, along with funding for the initial stages, are needed to scale these companies both locally and globally, and investors are on board.  LAVCA showed startups in the fintech sector received more investment in 2015 than any other startup sector in the region. Fintech accounted for almost 30 percent of the entire IT sector's investment in 2015, and 40 percent in the first half of 2016. The global startup network Startupbootcamp recently announced its expansion to Latin America by launching a dedicated fintech program in Mexico in a joint effort with Finnovista. Over the past four years, Finnovista claims they've witnessed how fintech startups have shaped financial services in the region and recognized that these companies cannot scale by themselves. The program aims to provide fintech startups in Mexico, and beyond, access to the funding and mentorship needed to grow their companies. Seedstars, too, traveled around Latin America over the past few years to find top entrepreneurs and connect them with global investors and partners. This year, focus has been on fintech innovations coming out of the region. Colombian crowd factoring startup Mesfix and Brazilian financial planning services startup QueroQuitar were selected as finalists to present at the Seedstars Summit. \nRelated Articles\nBrazil: A look into Latin America's largest startup ecosystem\nWhy have some of Silicon Valley's top investors started investing in Latin America?\nBeek is the emoji-based book review site aiming to change e-commerce in Latin America\n 500 Startups is increasing its seed-stage funding efforts in Latin America. With a new $10 million fund in partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), 500 Startups aims to provide early-stage funding to 120 Latin American companies this year to help top founders succeed. Google recently selected more than a dozen Latin American startups for its Launchpad Accelerator program aimed at helping local startups reach their full potential by leveraging Google's global reach and resources. Microsoft has set up the BR Startups fund in Brazil to help fill the gap between early capital and larger rounds, investing in 70 startups to date. Payments giant Visa also launched an acceleration program to assist new ventures in the fintech space in Brazil with their business models and fundraising. It wasn't long ago that venture capitalists focused their efforts elsewhere, and Latin American startups had little to no access to early-stage financing for their companies. But as attitudes have changed, and both organizations and governments have begun fostering entrepreneurial ecosystems across the region, investment opportunities and activity in Latin American startups have been steadily on the rise. Momentum is building, with success stories like Brazil's Nubank and Argentina's IguanaFix becoming a regular occurrence, and there's never been a better time than now to be involved with the Latin American startup scene.

The idea is to connect brands, retailers, designers and entrepreneurs with available space, and as frictionless as possible and all done online. The company launched first in the U.K., but has since expanded to France, and most recently New York in the U.S. \"With our international expansion, we're excited to continue to build deep relationships in the top retail cities around the world,\" says founder and CEO Ross Bailey, in a statement. \"Appear Here is the world leader at what we do and this is the perfect time for us to scale. We've got offices in London, Paris and New York, and now we're looking forward to launching more tools and opening up new locations for our growing community to take their ideas to the next level\". To date, the startup says its marketplace has been used by more than 80,000 brands, including the likes of Nike, Loewe, Givenchy, Coca-Cola, Net-a-Porter, and Kanye West, and a raft of independents -- the whole idea is to lower the barrier for a brand or startup wanting to have a temporary brick 'n' mortar presence, after all. Meanwhile, more than 4,000 \"exclusive spaces\" have been listed. ",

    "content": "Notion Capital, the London-based VC focused on enterprise SaaS and cloud startups, is announcing a number of updates today. This includes a new later-stage follow-on fund for existing portfolio companies, and the final closing of its third early-stage fund, which now counts Cisco amongst a number of new U.S.-based LPs. The firm has also made two internal promotions, with both Chrys Chrysanthou and Patrick Norris making the step up to partner. Dubbed \"Notion Capital Opportunities LP,\" the new growth equity fund is targeting a final close of $80 million and will be used by Notion to do later-stage investments -- think Series C and beyond -- in the best performing companies in its current portfolio, and in a way that would not be possible by simply following on out of its existing funds. I understand Notion has already raised 55 percent of the new fund's target size, whilst the thinking behind the follow-on vehicle is to \"augment investment returns\" and position the firm as an even more attractive and long-term funding partner for the companies and founders it backs. Notion is also communicating the final close of \"Notional Capital III LP,\" its third early-stage fund at $140 million, $120 million of which had previously been announced. Notably, new LPs include Cisco Investments, the venture capital arm of Silicon Valley tech giant Cisco, as well as two U.S. university endowments, Emory and Texas A&M. Ireland's Key Capital has also invested in the fund. In a call, Notion Capital Managing Partner Stephen Chandler said the fact that the VC has pulled in U.S.-based LPs for the final closing of fund three is a reflection of the growing interest across the pond in European tech startups. This, he said, was in stark contrast to the state of play back in 2009 when Notion Capital was first started by himself and the two founders of MessageLabs, after it sold for $700 million to Symantec a year earlier. Asked about the trouble other U.K. funds are reportedly having closing, because of uncertainty now that Brexit's Article 50 has been triggered and in relation to Europe's largest LP, the partly European tax-payer funded European Investment Fund (EIF), Chandler says that this was something he took into account when actively courting U.S. investors. Put simply, given Brexit, he wanted Notion to diversify its LPs away from being so reliant on the EU, and says U.S. LPs now make up 20 percent of Notion Capital III's final closing. Investors in the U.K., including the state-backed British Business Bank, accounts for 25 percent, Middle East investors account for 25 percent and EU investors, such as the EIF and various European family offices, make up the remaining 30 percent. Meanwhile, Chandler says the promotion of Chrysanthou and Norris to full partner roles is a sign that Notion itself is maturing along with its in-house talent. Specifically, it signals that the firm has moved beyond simply being known as the European SaaS fund founded by ex-MessageLabs operators and owners. \"These developments leave us exceptionally well positioned for 2017 and beyond, so we feel excited about what the future holds for Notion,\" he adds in a statement. \"From the start we set out to build a genuinely differentiated venture capital firm that would be sustainable across multiple generations. Talent is obviously critical to that mission so it is particularly pleasing to recognise the contribution of our two new partners with these internal promotions.\" ",

    "content": "UploadVR is being sued by the company's former Director of Digital and Social Media for sexual harassment, sex and gender discrimination and wrongful termination, TechCrunch has learned. The virtual reality startup, with offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles, consists of co-working spaces, training courses and a media publication, and has received funding from General Catalyst, Greycroft's GC Tracker fund, Colopl and others. Other defendants named in the suit include UploadVR co-founders Will Mason and Taylor Freeman. Freeman currently serves as CEO. Mason holds the role of president; previously he was editor-in-chief of the company's publication. Mason and Freeman were recently named in the media section of Forbes' 30 under 30 list. The lawsuit alleges that UploadVR's co-founders sought to create a \"boy's club\" environment and that the virtual reality startup's SF office was a hostile environment for female employees. \"The atmosphere and work environment at UploadVR was marked by rampant sexual behavior and focus, creating an unbearable environment for Plaintiff and other female employees. \"Defendants purposefully and expressly created a 'boy's club environment at work, focused on sex and degrading women, including female employees.\" UploadVR hosts a number of parties at the startup's offices and at other venues during conferences. The startup has collaborated with a number of high-profile tech companies to host many of these parties. The lawsuit alleges that Upload VR's co-founders would discuss \"how many girls they were going to have sex with\" at the company's parties. A room in the office with a bed was allegedly designated as the \"kink room,\" where employees would have sex. \"In the office, Defendants would frequently talk about how much sex they were going to have at each party, and how many girls they were going to have sex with. UploadVR even set up a room to encourage sexual intercourse at the workplace. The room was referred to as the \"kink room\" and contained a bed. Male employees used that room to have sexual intercourse, which was disruptive and inappropriate. Often, underwear and condom wrappers would be found in the room.\" The lawsuit describes another incident where the company rented a home for its employees to stay during a conference in LA and a party was thrown where one of the male employees invited prostitutes and strippers. There are numerous other encounters described in the suit: \"Male employees, including Mason and Freeman, would even speak sexually about women that worked in the office, right in front of them. For example, male employees stated how they were sexually aroused by female employees and how it was hard to concentrate and be productive when all they could think about was having sex with them.\" Aside from the accusations that the co-founders were operating a \"sexually-focused\" work environment, the lawsuit also alleges that women were discriminated against in the office, given menial tasks and were not reimbursed for necessary business expenses. The suit also claims that the company paid male employees more despite sharing the same roles and responsibilities. In addition to raising many of the issues above, the plaintiff says she was wrongfully terminated. The plaintiff is suing for damages of an unspecified amount. The plaintiff did not respond to a request for comment. We have reached out to her lawyers and will update if they respond. TechCrunch has reached out for comment from UploadVR. Update: TechCrunch has been provided the following statement from defendants Mason and Freeman: \"We cannot comment directly on any pending litigation. What we want to express is that our employees are our greatest asset and the sole reason for the success of this company. We are committed to creating a positive community in VR/AR as well as within our company culture and will work to further develop that mission in the future. We are confident that the true nature of how we treat our employees and how we operate as leaders will shine through this unfortunate situation and confirm that these allegations are entirely without merit.\" You can read the full filing below.

    "content": "Why are there so few women angel investors in South Africa? It's a question that continues to puzzle local venture capitalist Andrea Bohmert. \"I would love to have the answer to that question, because I don't have it,\" said Bohmert, a partner in venture capital (VC) fund Knife Capital. Bohmert was speaking at a women in angel investing event hosted by the SA Business Angels Network (Saban) last night at FNB's offices in Cape Town. She pointed out that just one of the 24 investors in Knife Ventures -- Knife Capital's VC company approved by the South African Revenue Service (Sars) in August last year -- is a women. \"I am convinced that women have better networks (than men)... but that they are worse at using them,\" said Bohmert, who added that women are also not good at asking for advice. Also speaking at the event, Swiss South African angel investor Nanci Govinder (pictured above), said a lack of knowledge on business angels held women back from becoming angel investors. She said one of the biggest hurdles is that women believe that they need a lot of money to be an angel investor. Govinder is a deal leader at angel investing network Rising Tide Europe and head coach at the Swiss Commission of Technology and Innovation (CTI). The angel investing group's Swiss chapter has 93 women currently who each invest a minimum of EUR10 000. The group was set up at the beginning of last year. She said one of the biggest enjoyments of angel investing is seeing entrepreneurs grow and later sell their companies thanks to initial investments from angel investors.

Presenting the Department of Small Business Development's budget vote in Parliament today, Zulu said her department will help entrepreneurs to build the right digital capabilities. \"The 4th Industrial Revolution, characterised by digitisation and automation, is gaining momentum. It will fundamentally change the way is which we live, work, transact and trade. \"It thus stands to reason that the small business and co-operatives sector must future-proof their core business offerings and business models, in order to be part of a digitised world and economy, failing which they will fall behind and remain trapped in a survivalist mode,\" said Zulu. She said the Small Enterprise Development Agency (Seda) will continue to provide entrepreneurs with help in digital innovation and product development, and in building digital supply chain and operating systems, digital marketing, sales and service. Zulu said the recent launch of the French-SA Tech lab in Cape Town, the second of two on the continent would help in this regard. The centre, which was launched in November, helps entrepreneurs to design and test their innovative IT solutions.

    "content": "With the City of Cape Town seeking to introduce further water restrictions from 1 June, city authorities would do well to turn to entrepreneurs from four local startups who have designed innovative solutions. The four startups last night won a pitching challenge hosted by Stellenbosch University's LaunchLab to design solutions to tackle water and waste management. Their prize includes incubation and business support from the incubator. The four -- chosen from 11 participants -- are: Bridgiot: which has developed an internet-of-things solutions to provide instant notifications to users on their water usage. The startup is led by Jurie Envee. AlwaysOn founder Nico Pretorius is also involved in the company.\nGreen Chain Engineering: a startup run by Peter Turner and Styger Kruger who have developed an app and solution that uses a combination of grey water recycling and rainwater harvesting.\nEva Solutions (pictured above): The five founders have developed a solution to lower evaporation from dams using a system of recycled plastic balls that float on the water.\nRevolute: A system designed by Jacobus Els and two other colleagues that uses carefully calibrated sensors to measure soil moisture for farmers, thereby helping them to conserve water usage. The challenge was proposed two months ago in partnership with the Stellenbosch Innovation District. During the event each participant had three minutes to pitch their proposal and a further five minutes to field questions from the judges as well as from the occasional audience member. Speaking at the pitching event last night Israel's ambassador to South Africa Arthur Lenk said there was no \"single silver bullet\" to solving a water crisis. Instead it required a number of strategies including a mix between recycling grey water, desalination and drip irrigation for agriculture. Lenk detailed how Israel, a largely dry country, has been able to overcome its water challenges. While Israeli today has five desalination plants, Leak advised that there is no need for the Western Cape province to adopt desalination on a wide scale if one is able to reduce leakages and theft of water from 40% to 20% of all water usage. He pointed too, to the importance of recycling grey water. \"If there was an Olympics for recycling water Israel would win,\" said Lenk, adding that the country recycles 86% of grey water, far ahead of the second placed country Spain, which recycles 20% of grey water. He said the Israeli and South African governments have a cooperation agreement in place to exchange lessons on tackling water usage, adding that about three SA delegations are expected to attend the upcoming Watec conference to be held in Israel in September. \"If we could do it (tackle water shortages) South Africa can too,\" he said. Lenk was one of the five judges for the challenges. The four other judges were: Stellenbosch University professor and soil scientist Leopoldt van Huyssteen; Saliem Haider from the Stellenbosch Municipality, Yondela Tyawa representing community group the Enkanini Research Centre and water-process engineer Dan Petrie of the Aurecon Group.

    "content": "The Innotribe Startup Challenge in partnership with SWIFT's African Regional Conference concluded yesterday in Abidjan, with three fintech companies walking away with cash prizes and more.

    "content": "If you haven't noticed, the worldwide workforce is shifting away from traditional nine-to- five roles and toward a flexible freelance economy. English-speaking nations such as the US and the UK are both producing and hiring independent workers at a rapid rate. About half of the UK's working population will be self-employed within the next five years, while one-third of the US workforce is made up of freelancers. But why is this good news for South Africans? Making the most of your business today means going far beyond your own backyard. As a result, non-native English speakers have the potential to work across borders to grow their companies on a global scale. Thanks to the recent rise of the \"gig economy,\" entrepreneurs and business owners in South Africa have a worldwide reach when it comes to finding new clients, customers and streams of revenue. The gig economy signals a massive window of opportunity for South African professionals. However, the emerging independent workforce also means global competition. Those looking to truly take advantage of the gig economy need the right resources and tools at their disposal. Consider how following platforms and tools represent the building blocks of thriving in the gig economy regardless of your business or industry. For business owners, the advantage of hiring freelancers is two-fold. Firstly, freelancers provide businesses with flexibility with hiring as they can find talent on a project-by- project basis instead of relying on full-timers. Secondly, freelancers can be hired at the fraction of the cost of a dedicated employee. In pursuit of clients, freelancers and independent workers are flocking to platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr. In short, these sites allow freelancers in countries such as South Africa to connect with professionals from around the world. From marketing and IT professionals to customer service reps and virtual assistants, these platforms encompass some of the gig economy's most popular professions. Freelance platforms essentially allow freelancers to bid for jobs on a project-by- project basis. Upwork's bidding system is particularly useful for South Africans who can apply for gigs at a more competitive rate versus native English-speakers. Bear in mind that sometimes non-native speakers are stigmatised by business owners in the West: it's important to display proficiency in English on your profile and advertise authentically when searching for gigs. Allowing freelancers to connect with professionals from over 180 countries, platforms such as Upwork provide a secure marketplace for freelancers to do business across the globe. Blogging is not only a necessity for modern web-based businesses looking for more traffic and leads, but also represents a potential revenue stream in and of itself. As noted by marketing guru Neil Patel, starting a blog that generates income is possible in just about any industry. Considering that businesses that blog receive 67% more leads, the benefits of blogging are difficult to ignore regardless of what you might be selling. Similar, blog and content writers are among the most sought-after assets for today's businesses. Whether you're writing for yourself or on behalf of someone else in another country, blogging can quickly become a full-time job for skilled writers with specialised knowledge. By itself, blogging can plant the seeds of a full-time business in addition to advertising your company to a global audience. Especially given its relatively low financial investment, consistent blogging has become an expectation for companies today for rather than an exception to the rule. Ecommerce has recently overtaken in-person shopping, with today's shoppers making over half of their purchases digitally. The key takeaway here is that consumers today are not afraid to spend money online, especially if they're working with a trusted marketplace. As such, South Africans have plenty of options when it comes to finding places to sell their physical  products. For example, Amazon represents a prime option for businesses due to its name recognition and the platform's ability to handle selling millions of products. The same rings true for ecommerce giants such as eBay and niche platforms such as Etsy which focus on arts and home goods. Content creation is the cornerstone of today's most successful companies. The combination educating your audience via blogging while also producing video represents the ideal content strategy for any business looking to expand their reach. Consider that video is projected to account for about 80% of all web traffic within the next few years. As a result, video marketing has exploded in popularity as web-based businesses are searching for ways to inform, entertain and effectively sell to an audience glued to the screen. With video consumption at an all-time high, savvy businesses are using video education as an effective means of growing their audience. Not unlike the world of blogging, video marketing can be used to both educate leads and ultimately feed them into your funnel. Online tools such as Kajabi are helping businesses reach and teach their leads simultaneously. Video marketing through online courses is easy for your audience to digest and represents a cost-effective way to position your business as a leader in your industry. Through Kajabi, just about any business can create and sell online content regardless of their industry. From marketers and contractors to service-based business and those selling physical progress, just about any professional can effectively sell their knowledge. Content creation goes hand in hand with attracting more business. Given that today's consumers are more likely to watch a video versus sift through text, incorporating videos and education into your content strategy is a solid idea to make sure you aren't missing any potential leads. Perhaps one of the most important aspects of succeeding in the gig economy is ensuring that you get paid in a consistent, timely manner. While there are platforms out there for workers and businesses making transactions (such as Upwork), often freelancers must deal with businesses independently to ensure payment. Secure online payment through digital wallets such as Due can give independent workers peace of mind as they juggle multiple clients in different countries. Not only are digital wallets more secure than traditional payment via check, but also process in a matter or days versus weeks. South Africans have all the opportunity in the world to find success via the flexible gig economy. That being said, competing on a global scale means finding opportunities that play to your strengths and finding unique ways to market your skills. Itai Elizur is COO at Inbound Junction, a content marketing agency specialising in helping startups and business increase their online visibility. Find him on https://twitter.com/ItaiElizur Hi Itai, Blogging for a global audience is huge. I met a South African couple in Bali a few years back, who'd been traveling the world though blogging. Think not your country as an audience, but the world, and you will be on your way to creating something helpful, special and sustaining for yourself and your readers.

    "content": "Israel's success as a startup nation can be attributed to the notion of \"if you don't have it, you either go without it or innovate, invent, and do better\". So says Carel De Wet, the general manager of cloud service vendor iCloudius. He was talking at Salesforce's \"What Western Cape's Tech companies should learn from Tel Aviv's Startup Nation\" event, held at Workshop 17 in Cape Town today. \"It's not as if they have better technology than we do. It's not that we don't have the same resources or the skill... We just need to take it to the next level,\" says De Wet. He believes that a key reason Israel became such a successful entrepreneurial nation was because they stuck to their projected path. \"In 2000 there was a study done by the Bank of Israel and they said that if the country does perfectly well, from their government, institutions, right through to their financing and their economy, they could potentially grow to a market of 750-billion Israeli shekels ($207-billion) which is about R3-trillion,\" says De Wet. Israel, he said, went on to exceed this expectation by 37%. He attributed Israel's success to the country sticking to the 15-year plan. Similarly he said South Africa and the Western Cape, in particular, should also focus on the long-term growth, by fostering startups. A key way to do so is to assist accelerators and incubators, he added. \"One of the key parts (Israel) used were the accelerators and the incubators where they helped technology companies start up and that's what's happening in the Western Cape,\" says De Wet. \"Companies can start up, they have access to funding, skilled workers and they're able to get into the incubators and accelerators and roll out a product in a much shorter time frame by using the expertise of international companies or experts.\" Another condition attributed to the success of Israel is the attitude, says De Wet. \"It's their chutzpah. It's not only having the belief but the persistence to push through with it, not giving up on the dream, not giving up on the belief on what you feel you must do to make this world and your company a better place.\" He stressed the importance for startups to not just remain within the local market, but to branch out and find others internationally from which they can receive funding. \"It's very important that you're not stuck in your own currencies and that you're tapped into the wider world and the financing available to you.\" Probably the biggest factor to Israel's success is that startups have access to funding. \"There are over one billion dollars available to them in VC funds so that they can start new businesses there's always a market for them to take their great ideas and get funding in order to develop it, build it, market it and sell it,\" says De Wet. For South African startups however he says the challenge is more access to funding. \"There is funding available but how do you get access to it, what is it that you must do to make yourself as a startup attractive? How do you get your hands on that money in order to be able to fund or grow your development strategy going forward.\" He said Israel also benefited from the significant amount of investment that the government has made in education especially around science and engineering.

    "content": "Cape Town mobile taxi ordering startup Zapacab has released native apps for Android and iOS devices. This is in response to passengers demand for \"clever, easy to use apps\". Zapacab initially launched their product on mobile browsers to allow all passengers the easiest access to ordering a cab. With the majority of users being Android and iPhone users, the requests for a slicker app-based experience have been numerous. Chief executive officer (CEO) Rupert Sully says they will continue to offer the web based service for Blackberry users, but felt it was strategic to launch the native apps. \"It is the sort of service you use on a regular basis so an app makes sense. People love clever, easy to use apps, and that is exactly what our team has delivered,\" he said. The app is free and really easy to download, and in no time you can start ordering Cabs straight from your homescreen, with just two clicks. Additionally, moving to a native app means a faster experience for Zapacab passengers, and includes a spruced up design.  The team says they have seen a great uptake since launching the app this week. Rupert informed us that they will be continuing to limit their coverage to Cape Town until they have polished their service here, but passengers can still download and play with the app throughout the country. \"Unlike other taxi apps, we have kept it simple. No account creation and minimal choices makes Zapacab the quickest and simplest app to order a cab in Cape Town,\" says Product Manager Matthew Aberdein. Zapacab is also working closely with the industry to empower the drivers. \"Technology is a great way to help these guys improve their service and stand their own against international competition,\" explains Rupert. The existing taxi market is highly disorganised and consumers suffer. The drivers also suffer as they are under-utilised and have no smart systems to rely upon. Zapacab hopes to put an end to the unnecessary 40 minute wait that passengers experience. Download the app and let us know what you think in the comments below. iPhone - https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/zapacab/id808192040?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D2 Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zapacab.phoneapp&hl=en ",

    "content": "It's a startup's worst nightmare - having grown to over 100 employees everything suddenly slows. The bills start piling up but without growth you're unable to meet the higher costs that your bigger business is consuming. Everything you spent years building is about to come crumbling down. Jason Goldberg, founder of 10XE, has helped tens of entrepreneurs scale their business. Speaking at the Western Cape Funding Fair, held at the Cape Town Convention Centre on 10 May, Goldberg says while just the top one percent of startups end up scaling their business to a more sizeable firm, over 70% of these scale-ups end up stuck in a type of no-man's land. \"It's a very bleak stage to live in,\" he says, admitting that he's seen \"a lot more failure than success\". \"It's like the Bermuda Triangle of growth,\" he says. \"It means that you work for 10 years and after 10 years you're poorer than you were 10 years ago.\" So why do so many growing firms get stuck? \"It's because everything changes when you scale a company,\" says Goldberg. \"At the start you are trying to figure out your offering. After that works you're busy scaling a business, building a management team,\" he says. \"The irony is because you succeed the size and type of organisation changes,\" he adds. Along with this the company culture changes - the relaxed everything-goes culture of a startup will no longer cut it. \"When you're a startup you hire a Swiss army knife (of a person), but when you're at a 100-person company, you need specialists,\" explains Goldberg. He adds that often the most valuable, loyal contributors to your startup will no longer do when you're a growing scale-up. Crucial is building the right middle-management team. Goldberg lists this as \"the number one\" distinction between those firms that got stuck and those that are able to scale successfully. It also means staying true to oneself as an entrepreneur and asking where ones strengths lie and serving these. When running a scale-up one needs to mindset that steps out of the day-to-day running of the business and ask \"what am I doing here\" and \"Am I attracting growth\". At times it means acknowledging that you might not be the best person to lead the business but might need to call in an outsider to takeover, he says. Concedes Goldberg: \"It's very difficult to be honest and shift to the boring world where you're building processes. It's about disciplined entrepreneurship.\" Featured image: Boudewijn Berends via Flickr (CC 2.0, resized) Ventureburn focuses on startup news and technology trends in emerging markets.

    "content": "It was out of desperation that entrepreneur Jessica Bonin started her tea business -- to escape dead-end work in the film industry. Bonin, the founder of Lady Bonin, was speaking at yesterday's Startup Grind Cape Town, hosted at Workshop 17 in the city. The global Startup Grind community dedicated the month of May toward celebrating the success of female founders. \"I was doing something that went against my very moral core. I didn't have a business degree or anything like that, and I wanted to find a skill that would allow me to start my own business because that's where I realised I needed to be, I always had entrepreneurial tendencies.\" This desperation led her to start her own business in December 2010. The road, however, wasn't easy. With money being tight she couldn't afford to rent a business premises. So she sought out an alternative solution -- a tea caravan. \"There were a few people that responded to the idea quite well, a good group of hipster friends at the time, so of course they just jumped at the idea.\" She quickly learned that although the caravan gave her convenience in terms of mobility, it wasn't a sustainable option. \"In the beginning, I was doing one market a week... I had to look at what was the next viable option. I was packaging the tea and selling it from the caravan so I thought 'okay let me go around and see if I can get anyone else to buy the tea'. So I did a couple of door-to-door with niche delis... people who would take this sort of artisanal product.\" This  led her to land a client that would eventually be the source of her startup capital -- andBeyond (formerly CC Africa) game lodges. Her approach was to create flavourful tea's that represented the various regions the lodges were situated in. Once she landed finance she began looking at how to expand. This led her to purchase a storefront in what is now known as The Woodstock Exchange. She admitted that she wasn't really expecting to open a store front so soon, as she was hoping to purchase a small \"factory\" first. However seeing as though storefront was in her three-year plan, she decided to pursue the opportunity. It proved to be a good decision as she was able to have a space large enough to make and sell her tea. Sometime later she was accepted into the Impact Amplifier Accelerator. \"It was five months of the most grueling, intense and incredible (experiences)... every two weeks we'd have a full day of whatever the programme was.\" But she admitted that the experience proved invaluable to her business. \"What I've learned was that I'm constantly having to break down my house and build it again because there was something 'tweaky' in my foundations.\" \"The incubator really helped me understand my business and understand what I was doing and where I'm going and the steps that are going to get me there,\" she said. Regardless of the challenging experiences, Bonin wasn't hesitant to express her gratitude of the processes that led her where she is today. \"I'm definitely glad about where I'm at now. The caravan was beautiful it allowed me the opportunity to engage with people, it provided this space where people wanted to have this new experience which was takeaway tea.\" Bonin isn't using the caravan currently, but plans to bring it back on board soon. Lady Bonin continues to grow as its currently awaiting its organic certification to be approved before they can begin exporting to Japan. Read more: Q&A: Lady Bonin founder shares her journey as a female entrepreneur \"We're (also) trademarked in China, I've decided to take a step back from China because they're very difficult with prices (and) I haven't found a partner that I'm happy with. We've just sent off samples to Korea and it's been picked up really well so we're in the process of waiting for our first order to come through there,\" she said. She added that the company has exported to Amsterdam and has generated interest from Malaysia. Bonin also fielded questions around fair trade and how Lady Bonin handles the seemingly controversial tea industry. \"Essentially what we do is we support small-scale farms that have community-based initiatives, we pay a premium to our farms so we go beyond fair trade,\" she said. \"I'm suspect of the whole fair trade thing in my experience so I prefer to go and see the farms for myself... so I understand what's going on in the picture. I'm not one to believe any piece of paper which is why I like to go and see it for myself.\" Bonin said her biggest failure as an entrepreneur was to believe that failure \"meant failure\". \"It was the misunderstanding of failure. Failure is the only way that you learn and it's absolutely necessary,\" she concluded. Also at yesterday's Startup Grind Linda Swart, Standard Bank's Incubator manager announced the conclusion of the bank's first cohort of female tech entrepreneurs. Bonnie Horbach, the consul general of Kingdom of the Netherlands in Cape Town also took the chance to announce a partnership with Startup Grind to bring the European founded Inspiring 50 to South Africa. Read more: Over 100 nominations received so far for inspiring SA women in tech initiative \"We are looking for the most inspiring women in the tech and innovation sector in SA. I want to showcase to the European continent the talent that's here, that they shouldn't be here to come and help but that they should be here if they want to do business.\" Featured image: Nsight Pictures via Startup Grind ",

    "content": "Martin Casado. Northern Arizona University Martin Casado is a legend in his own corner of the tech world for inventing a technology that radically alters the way computer networks are built. He invented the tech while he was a PhD student at Stanford. He took that invention, and two of the professors advising him (legends in their own right) Nick McKeown from Stanford and Scott Shenker from University of California, Berkeley, and founded a startup back in 2012. It was called Nicira and it was backed by VCs like Andreessen Horowitz (\"a16z\"). \"Nicira launched into the networking industry like a cannonball hitting placid water,\" a16z founder Marc Andreessen wrote of Nicira and of Casado. That's true. The company was quietly founded in 2007, but didn't officially launch until early 2012. Five months later, it sold to VMware for a stunning $1.26 billion. And the network industry has never been the same. After staying with VMware for a few years, Casado left in early 2016 to become a VC with a16z. But the interesting thing is, he doesn't think of himself as a runaway success. He thinks of himself as someone who \"got good at failure.\" Or so he told the 2017 graduating class at his first alma mater, Northern Arizona University, where he spoke after receiving an honorary PhD on May 13. \"When I was standing where you are, I wanted to be the world's best computational physicist,\" Casado confessed to the crowd. \"And soon after I wanted to be the world's foremost cyber policy expert. But instead I went to grad school, and then I wanted to be the world's best academic. And I certainly didn't accomplish that.\" \"I only found computer science because I couldn't hack it as a physicist, and then I failed as a microbiology student. I made many, many missteps as the first time founder of a company,\" he said. Casado's speech was short, sweet, funny, and profound. VMware's Martin Casado is considered the father of SDN VMware I heard it because I was in the audience that day, proudly watching my own daughter graduate with a degree in astrophysics (notice how I slipped in that motherly brag?). While I'm insanely proud of my kid, I'm also biting my nails over what her degree will lead to. She doesn't want to go to grad school right now. And although she knows forms of math that I didn't even know existed, what kind of career will she have? I don't know. And neither does she. But Casado's speech flipped my view on it. He offered four solid bits of advice to students, which is good advice for anyone, at any age: Since no one can predict the future, while on the path to a goal, a better goal \"is likely to smack you while you're looking the other way, and you'd be an idiot not to follow it,\" he said. His advice is to \"take some fraction of that effort and work on being open to change, and to opportunity,\" while working toward your goals. If he hadn't been open to change in his career, he never would have invented an industry-changing technology. He suggests that it is really \"failure,\" not \"progress\" that indicates whether you are living up to your potential. If you are failing, you are truly pushing yourself, and \"not stalling your own progress by hiding.\" The true skill, then, is \"to learn to embrace failure. Not only embrace failure, get good at it, and by that I mean get back up, apply what you've learned, and hit reset.\" Every person is unique, and that means what's right for others isn't always right for you. When it comes to advice, listen to the parts that ring true for you, and disregard the rest. \"You're going to take one path out of an infinite number of possibilities,\" Casado said. \"And you're going to navigate it your way.\" So, if there is a secret to life, happiness, and success, it's this: \"The opportunity is hidden in the sloppiness. If you hold too hard to specific ideas of where you want to go, or what the landscape will look like, or what the world will provide you, I can guarantee you'll be disappointed.\" CASADO: \"Graduates, I am deeply honored to have a few minutes with you. So let me first thank you for the opportunity and your attention. Right now. This moment. Is one of the most significant inflection points in your life. And perhaps not in the way you'd expect. So if you'll indulge me, I'd like to explain why. Getting to this point. This space we're all sharing right now, has taken a tremendous amount of work and dedication. No doubt. And for that, I applaud you, and you have my deepest respect. However, a university education, no matter how windy, is a path with a clear goal. It was challenging, sure. Yet generally the objective was pretty obvious: Work hard and get the hell out. All of that is about to change. Almost two decades ago I was standing where you are now. I was nervous. I was excited. And I was largely over it. And so I took that proverbial step. And very quickly, I realized that where I landed was very, very different from where I left. It was as if I stepped off of a narrow path and into a city. And unlike my university experience, there was no clear goal. There wasn't a defined string of classes or tests I had to pass. There was no notion of a start or finish. Instead there was a vast, vast collection of opportunities and perils. Infinite routes, to infinite locations, and none of which I really understood. You could chose to stop or move at any time with equal chance of benefit or loss. And I found that none of my experiences really prepared me to navigate such a wide open space. There were no platitudes, no cliches, no quippy one liners that provided clear and useful guidance. It wasn't just about working hard and setting goals. It wasn't just about perseverance or having a positive attitude. I knew how to do all those things. This new space required something far different. So with that backdrop I'd like to offer you some advice. Lessons that no one would be able to put on a motivational poster and keep their job. Lessons to keep in mind as you take this next step into the chaos. First: You're unlikely to achieve your goals. Really, it's very unlikely. When I was standing where you are, I wanted to be the world's best computational physicist. And soon after I wanted to be the world's foremost cyber policy expert. But instead I went to grad school and then I wanted to be the world's best academic. And I certainly didn't accomplish that. You're unlikely to achieve your goals. The reason is that you probably don't realize how many amazing opportunities are out there, and how much you'll enjoy them. You are unlikely to achieve your goals, because a better one is likely to smack you while you're looking the other way, and you'd be an idiot not to follow it. So my guidance to you is as much as you work towards your goals, take some fraction of that effort and work on being open to change, and to opportunity. Second: You are going to fail. A lot. It's inevitable. I only found computer science because I couldn't hack it as a physicist, and then I failed as a microbiology student. I made many, many missteps as the first time founder of a company. You are going to fail because you're going to be navigating a shifting landscape with a lot of things not under your control. You're going to fail because the goals are going to change or be unclear. You're going to fail because you'll start something, and realize it's not what you want to do. And here's the key: Failing will be your only true measure of progress. It's inevitable. The system you're about to walk into is simply too dynamic and too poorly defined for you not to. And so my guidance to you is to learn to embrace failure. Not only embrace failure, get good at it, and by that I mean get back up, apply what you've learned, and hit reset. Third: No one really knows what contributes to success. Not me, not some business guru, or some pundit on the news. No one. And that's particularly true for your success. Yours. Here's the reality: Every one of you is a beautiful collection of amazing qualities and strengths. Unique in all the universe you. And you're going to take one path out of an infinite number of possibilities. And you're going to navigate it your way. So right here, I grant you permission to summarily ignore the nonsense of others. Take advice as input, sure. But check it against your absolutely unique perspective and qualities to bring to a problem. You do you, Boo. For what it's worth, of all the advice I've given you, this last request will probably be the most difficult. I know you can work hard. I know you're all smart, and capable, and resourceful. But I don't know how well you know yourself. I certainly didn't when I graduated. And it took a lot of inquiry, and a lot of failure, and a lot of false starts to begin to figure it out. In the words of Dr. Seuss, that he actually didn't write and I totally made up, \"You can't do you, Boo, if you don't know you\" OK, let me take a step back. Here's where all of this is leading. The universe is a messy place. And the real trick going forward is to acknowledge that, and to embrace it. The opportunity is hidden in the sloppiness. If you hold too hard to specific ideas of where you want to go, or what the landscape will look like, or what the world will provide you, I can guarantee you'll be disappointed. And it's exactly because the beauty is in the chaos. What have I asked of you? One, focus on being open to change because although you're all beautiful and bright and creative individuals, the opportunities are for more wondrous than you can possible conceive. Two, fail. It's the only way you know that you're riding the chaos and are not stalling your own progress by hiding. Three, no one knows what's best for you. Because really, it's unknowable. So ignore the pundits and do it your way. And to do that, know yourself. Because really, this journey is for you. And your priorities. And for those you care about. With that, I'll leave you with a quote. And this one I didn't make up. It's from the Ashtavakra Gita: 'Let the waves of the universe rise and fall as they will. You have nothing to gain or lose. You are the ocean.' Thank you very much, and again many congratulations.\"",

    "content": "The Wool Lounger from AllbirdsHollis JohnsonCan you improve on something that's already close to perfect? That's what I wondered after Allbirds last month debuted a new shoe, the $95 loafer-style \"Wool Loungers.\" When I reviewed the original $95 \"Wool Runners,\" last year, I was charmed by the New Zealand wool sneakers' look and feel. And I've continued to get tons of unsolicited compliments from strangers on them since. I'm not the only one in their thrall. Over the last year, Silicon Valley startup founders and venture capitalists have developed a taste for Allbirds, which claims its shoes are the \"most comfortable in the world.\" Indeed, the Valley has become \"obsessed\" with the shoe because of its low-key style and comfort, as my colleague Melia Robinson observed. To see if the Loungers lived up to the standard set by the Runners, I decided to put them to the test for a few weeks. Here are my impressions: The Loungers retain a lot of what made the original Runners special. They are extremely comfortable, though the fit is a tad tighter than the original around the toe. They are breathable enough to be fine in most weather, but I wouldn't recommend slogging through water in them. But it's in the style where they feel the most different from the Runners. From a comfort perspective, you can wear the Loungers either with or without socks. But from a stylistic perspective, they look much better without them.",

    "content": "Panasonic focused on auto tech during CES in January, Thomson Reuters Panasonic, like many companies today, is betting big on auto tech becoming a massive cash cow in the next decade. New alliances are forming almost every day as companies without a traditional foothold in the automotive space try to get a slice of the pie. Google is working with Fiat Chrysler on self-driving cars while making next-generation display systems for Volvo; new software startups like Otonomo are shelling out their services to major companies like Daimler; and BMW is partnering with companies like Intel on data collection. Panasonic is just one of many players collaborating with the auto industry to focus on vehicles of the future. \"Our business has evolved over a period of time, especially in the recent past of going from purely a consumer business to a B2B business,\" Tom Gebhardt, chairman and CEO of Panasonic's North American operations, told Business Insider. \"There's a number of reasons for that: The commoditization of consumer products [and] the unfavorability in some of the cost models led us to look for better values in-vehicle technologies,\" he continued. Tom Gebhardt, chairman and CEO of Panasonic's North American operations. Panasonic Prior to taking over Panasonic's North American division in April, Gebhardt led the company's automotive division for five years. Placing an executive with several years of automotive expertise at the helm of North American operations says something about the company's pivot from consumer electronics to auto tech. That larger cultural shift came from Panasonic President Kazuhiro Tsuga when he took over in 2012. As Forbes details in a 2016 profile, Tsuga was key to transitioning Panasonic from its failing plasma TV business to other revenue streams, like in-flight entertainment systems in planes and electric cars. Panasonic isn't stretching too far from its roots when it comes to this kind of vehicle tech. Gebhardt noted that Panasonic had a presence in the car radio business starting in 2008, giving it a natural introduction to multimedia displays with its electronics background. Gebhardt said Panasonic is channeling resources toward digital cockpits and vehicle entertainment systems as self-driving vehicles become more in reach. \"If the scenario says the car drives itself, it's similar to sitting in an airplane seat because you're no longer actively driving,\" he said. \"We see that as an evolution of the space that's quite interesting going forward that has infinite possibilities for us.\" Fiat Chrysler's portal concept. Screenshot As an extension of that plan, Panasonic recently worked with Fiat Chrysler on its semi-autonomous Portal concept car shown off at CES in January. The concept featured electronics like an OLED touchscreen with facial and voice recognition. Panasonic sees itself playing a role in fully autonomous cars as well by developing mobile offices or televisions specifically for self-driving cars, Gebhardt said. Perhaps more notable is Panasonic's relationship with Telsa. As one of the largest battery manufacturers in the world, competing with the likes of LG Chem and Samsung SDI, Panasonic had an easy entry into the electric vehicle space. The company plans to invest $1.6 billion in Tesla's Gigafactory. \"The future is definitely electric, no question in my mind, it's more of, 'what is the future timeline?' Is it 10 years, 15 years, 40 years?\" Gebhardt said. \"We don't see an alternative more interesting that, it's just a matter of what the adoption hits at the scale that makes this a slam dunk.\" Tesla's massive battery plant, the Gigafactory, in Sparks, Nevada. YouTube/Matthew Roberts But, there are hurdles to overcome in both these spaces. From the connected vehicle side, consumer adoption of infotainment systems is still lagging. J.D. Power led a 2016 study that found that more than 50% of car owners never used their in-vehicle displays after 90 days of purchase, preferring the ease of using their smartphones. But the tech is still in its first-generation, Gebhardt said, adding adoption will improve with the technology. Google's new Android display, for example, will integrate its smart voice assistant to encourage usage while driving. \"Any time you're dealing with a first generation product, a user is not going to be overly comfortable,\" he said. As for electric cars, vehicle adoption in the US is still tepid, and global sales hover at 1%. Gebhardt acknowledged adoption is slow in the US, particularly due to low gas prices -- a trend that is likely to persist if Trump comes through on his promise to roll back fuel emissions standards. He said, however, that this is likely a \"short-term problem.\" While the US market is slow to progress, there's still hope when it comes to China, which is making a concerted effort to incentivize battery-powered vehicles. China \"being the largest car market in the world has a big influence on what will happen,\" Gebhardt said. \"If they adopt in a big way, that changes the balance of where electric is today versus where it will be going.\" Panasonic has made some heavy investments in nascent areas, but expects to see a return on investment soon. Tsuga recently said Panasonic is expecting an increase in net profit in fiscal year 2017, its first gain in two years, because of new bets on transit, Nikkei Asian Review reported. \"We're pretty bullish on the fact that this is a space that will continue to grow and there's value there,\" Gebhardt said.

    "content": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Steve Jennings/Getty On an ordinary work day in mid-2016, a handful of Facebook engineers were sitting on the couches in a corner of the company's Menlo Park, California, headquarters when one of them tossed out a wacky idea. He suggested doing something that had never been done before and could potentially upend the $350 billion telecom market. \"It can't be so difficult to build our own system,\" the engineer said, referring to the telecom equipment that sends data across cables and wireless networks, and which the engineer suspected could be made to operate faster and cheaper than the pricey equipment sold by big vendors like Nortel, Huawei, Ericsson, Cisco or Juniper Networks. The engineer was suggesting building the telecom industry's first \"white box\" transponder, made with off-the-shelf parts such as chips from Broadcom and Acacia Communications, optical equipment from Lumentum, and software from one of the many new networking startups cropping up these days. Facebook's director of engineering Hans-Juergen Schmidtke, who was among those on the couch that day, was at first a naysayer. \"I was a little bit skeptical about it at the time,\" he recounted to Business Insider. As a former engineer at Juniper Networks, Schmidtke knew from experience that building telecom equipment systems was an expensive undertaking that involved hiring teams of specially trained engineers and sizeable R&D budgets. \"Building a system ten years ago was like building a new company,\" Schmidtke said. Still, Schmidtke agreed to help this tiny group hack together a white box system at one of Facebook's famous hackathons. Three months later they had a working prototype. Six months later, on November 1, they announced it to the world as a real product called Voyager. The product's unveiling sent shockwaves through the telecom industry, putting gear makers on notice that the lucrative market they controlled for decades was about to get turned upside down -- and not necessarily to their advantage. While the effort is essentially a side-project for Facebook, a social networking company whose bread-and-butter business is online advertising, the stakes could not be higher for the telecom equipment companies which risk seeing their specialized products reduced to interchangeable commodities and their influence diminished. For the industry's established companies, there's unease about Facebook's growing clout and its ultimate intentions. But in a sign of how serious Facebook's foray is being taken, there's already a recognition by some that the repercussions could be even more painful it they don't adapt. Voyager has already been tested by Facebook and European telecom company Telia over Telia's thousand-kilometer-telecom network. Plus, German telecom equipment maker ADVA Optical Networking is manufacturing the device and, as of a few weeks ago had nine customers trying it out for their telecom needs, a mix of big telecom companies and enterprises, it said. And Paris based telecom provider, Orange is also testing the device, working with Equinix and African telecom company MTN. \"We pulled it off essentially showing that when a few engineers can build a system within six months, the world has changed,\" Schmidtke said. One person told us that Schmidtke, who is insanely proud of Voyager, has become a star in his own corner of the tech world. When he and his team \"go to conferences, they treat him like a tech celebrity, like a rock band,\" that person said. Voyager was the first product, and a major proving point, for Facebook's young Telecom Infrastructure Project (TIP), a consortium led by Facebook and launched at the industry's worldwide gathering, Mobile World Congress, on February 21, 2016. Hans Juergen Schmidtke Facebook TIP is a spin-off from a similar organization Facebook launched a few years ago called the Open Compute Project (OCP). Facebook launched OCP and TIP because it had to take control over the technology it uses to support over 1.8 billion people uploading billions of photos, videos and updates every day. It has been designing its own IT equipment for years, things like computer servers, hard drives/storage systems and data center networks. Its versions were cheaper to build and easier to maintain than standard gear made by companies like Dell, HP, EMC and Cisco, it says. Lots of big internet companies build their own tech, including Amazon and Google. But Facebook is unusual in that it openly shares all the designs, literally gives them all away for free, inviting anyone at any other company to come work on them, with contract manufacturers standing by to sell it all. It's a concept called open source hardware. In this way, Facebook gets lots of help in maintaining and advancing its infrastructure. And the rest of the world gets access to tech designed to work in the most demanding circumstances, like at a huge internet company. OCP has radically changed the data center tech industry and those involved say it has created a cult-like following. For instance, when secretive Apple refused to join OCP to let its IT engineers collaborate with others, it's crew of network engineers quit their jobs. They turned around and launched a startup called SnapRoute and built network software for the OCP community, the story goes. Apple later joined OCP. SnapRoute wound up being the software chosen for Voyager. OCP created so much competetion for hardware vendors like Hewlett Packard and Dell that they opted to join the organization and embrace the white box concept. The alternative was to be squeezed out of selling their products to companies with the biggest and fastest-growing data centers in the world, not just Facebook, but Microsoft, Goldman Sachs and dozens of others. There was just one major area that had been somewhat left out of OCP's free and open source hardware revolution, the telecommunications part. That's the equipment that connects homes, businesses and data centers together across long distances, via undersea cables, wireless networks, and so on. Jay Parikh Facebook And the big telecom companies, those that spend millions of dollars a year on this gear, wanted in. They needed an OCP of their own, Facebook discovered when it launched its Internet.org, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's project to bring internet to underdeveloped countries. \"As we were thinking about Internet.org and helping get more people connected, the idea was, we're doing this thing called OCP to help the data center community to build infrastructure that's more efficient, more cost effective, that's greener and more sustainable, more flexible. And we said, can we do that for the telco industry?\" said Facebook's VP of engineering Jay Parikh. \"Facebook, having learned from OCP, comes in and says, we can play maybe a catalyzing function,\" Parikh said, describing early meetings he and his crew had at Mobile World Congress. \"We're investing our people and our dollars into technology that is going to solve these problems and we're going to contribute that technology, that IP [intellectual property] into the ecosystem so that you all can benefit from this.\" Voyager is one big example. \"That's something we developed and it's like, wow, we actually solved a problem that a bunch of operators seem to be struggling with,\" he said. South Korea Telecom's CTO Alex Choi agrees that telecom operators like SKT want faster, cheaper and more open equipment and were inspired by Facebook to take it into their own hands. Dr. Alex Choi, CTO, Executive Vice President and head of South Korea Telecom's corporate R&D Center Mobile World Live \"The idea all started from Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg was always addressing the importance of connecting the unconnected,\" Choi said. In 2015 and 2016, Zuckerberg came to the MWC conference, gave keynote speeches and hung out with top telecom executives. He wanted to know what was keeping those people off the internet. He discovered that b ringing telecom services to far-out parts of the world \"was too expensive,\" for telecom operators, Choi recalls. Facebook wanted to help bring the costs down. But developed nations in Europe, Asia and the Americas had the same problem. People are buying more devices, using more video. And with the Internet of Things, millions more objects are joining the internet daily, communicating over telecom networks. \"There's a huge growing traffic demand. That means we have to install more base stations, find more sites, invest more in the fiber and the backbone and supporting IT infrastructure,\" Choi said. But telcos can't charge more to cover the costs. People are are pushing them to charge less, for unlimited data plans. BARCELONA, SPAIN - MARCH 02: Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg walks onto the stage prior to his keynote conference during the first day of the Mobile World Congress 2015 at the Fira Gran Via complex on March 2, 2015 in Barcelona, Spain. David Ramos/Getty Images While Zuck didn't do the actual recruiting to get TIP off the ground, he \"inspired people\" Choi said. When Facebook executives approached him about forming the new organization, (including Aaron Bernstein, responsible for partnerships with mobile providers, and Jason Taylor, Facebook's vice resident of infrastructure who leads OCP), Choi liked the idea so much, he became the chairman of the TIP organization. It felt revolutionary. OCP has invented lots of cool new hardware for the data center and telecom operators had never banded together to build their own gear, he said. \"Operators rely too much on the big telco incumbent vendors. We kept pushing the vendors to do more innovations, to do something to bring down their premium price tag. They are making efforts and making progress but not as fast as we want them to be. So what can you do? You explore other opportunities,\" he said. Deutsche Telekom's Axel Clauberg was in a similar boat. He first got in touch with Facebook in 2015 about participating with OCP's networking efforts. There had been a push for more telcos to join OCP at that time because Facebook has been helping usher in a new way to build computer networks. It takes all the fancy, complex features out of the hardware and put them into software. In the corporate network world this push is called software-defined networking (SDN). But it's happening in the telecom service provider world, too, where its called Network Function Virtualization or NFV. Facebook didn't invent SDN or NFV, but in the slow and conservative world of network engineering, OCP and TIP are radically pushing these concepts forward. OCP is proving the technology works even for a huge demanding internet site like Facebook or for a giant telecom network like AT&T. \"We are facing exponential traffic growth,\" explains DT's Clauberg. \"We needed to do something.\" And there's one more issue going on besides tight budgets and huge growth, he said: the war for talent. Decades ago, hardware and communications engineers went to the telcos to build amazing new things, like mobile networks. Then they went to the tech companies like Cisco to build the tech that created the internet. Today, they are going directly to the internet companies like Google and Facebook and creating new hardware so they don't have to rely on the vendors, he said. TIP gives them a way to access the smartest minds, without having to poach them. \"When [engineers] come out of the universities, which companies are they looking at? In old days, it was the telcos, then it was the suppliers, now it's the internet companies. The funny thing is with OCP, you have all these parties working together. I envision achieving the same [with TIP]. So having players from internet companies, from startups and established vendors, and the telcos, working together on what the infrastructure of the future should look like.\" DT's Clauberg joined TIP as a founding board member, alongside SKT's Choi. This was a powerful first step. SDK and DT are two of the most advanced telcos in the world, role models for many others. Facebook also convinced Intel's Caroline Chan to join TIP, which was an easy sell. Intel is also a founding member of OCP. And TIP was off and running. But there was one surprise founding member of TIP: Nokia's Laurent Le Gourrierec. Telecom devices that can be put together with standard parts and software are deeply threatening to the multibillion telecom equipment market dominated by companies like Huawei Technologies, Ericsson, Cisco, ZTE, and Nokia. Vice President and CTO at Deutsche Telekom AG Axel Clauberg YouTube/GEN15 And Voyager isn't the only product. TIP's OpenCellular project is working on an open source 4G LTE/LTE base station, the hardware and the software. As SKT's Choi describes it, TIP wants to \"democratize\" the technology, making it easier for anyone to build, use, or modify. That means taking it out of the hands of the equipment providers who create proprietary radios and base stations today. TIP's impact won't happen overnight, explains analyst Rohit Mehra, vice president of IDC's Network Infrastructure practice. But the goal is clear: to overhaul the telecom equipment industry which he says is about a $350 billion market today, when factoring in software, hardware and services. \"This is not the first time Facebook has done this. They've been somewhat successful with what they call OCP,\" Mehra says. \"The Telecom Infrastructure Project is disruptive not just to telecom equipment makers but in some cases the telecom service providers. Though in some cases it helps the service providers because it intends to give them more cost-effective infrastructure.\" So TIP is, in some ways, threatening Nokia's main telecom business. But Nokia is a close partner of Facebook and the one telecom equipment vendor embracing TIP as a founding member and board member. Nokia's Laurent Le Gourrierec explains why, via an adaptation of Abraham Lincoln's famous quote. \"The best way to predict the future is to invent it,\" he tells Business Insider. \"You have all these equipment makers saying, 'The world is changing so let's try to hold on to what we know.' But the thing is that the world is changing anyway, so it's much better to take an active role in shaping the future.\" If all goes well, TIP and Facebook will actually help create new customers using new telecom services, those people in undeveloped nations that never had telecom or internet, Le Gourrierec believes. \"So it's best to participate in the definition of new partnerships, new services in partnership with the existing actors in addition to the new ones,\" Le Gourrierec said. When Facebook created Voyager, Nokia didn't shake in fear. Engineers there thought, \"Maybe we can learn something for this,\" Le Gourrierec said. But there are other equipment makers who are, technically, part of TIP too. Currently the organization boasts over 100 members from all facets of the industry. But Choi, Clauberg and Le Gourrierec said that many of them have only been nervously watching the group so far. Laurent Le Gourrierec, VP Strategic Partnerships at Nokia Nokia \"They are not actively contributing,\" Le Gourrierec said. Obviously, the kumbaya concept of open source doesn't work well like that. Everyone has to contribute their ideas for a community to blossom. One way that TIP is encouraging them to jump in is a different approach to sharing intellectual property. Participants don't have to share all their closely held, lucrative ideas and secrets for free like they do with OCP, or with other open source organizations, like Linux. Each working group in TIP can instead decide to use an older, more established method for sharing, known as Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory Terms (RAND). RAND allows vendors to be paid tiny fees by everyone who uses their intellectual property as long as those fees are reasonable and the tech is made available to everyone without bias. The company can't, for instance, jack up the price to its competitors. The TIP board members are also encouraging participation by telling members that TIP will lead to plenty of other new commercial opportunities, too, even if TIP successfully turns the hardware into low-cost generic white boxes. Teleco providers can instead develop new software that can be bought via lucrative subscriptions, similar to the software startups that have sprouted up around OCP. In fact, Nokia is already experimenting with a high-performance software product able to run on low cost, ordinary computer network hardware. It's geared toward businesses, not service providers, but it's a start, Le Gourrierec tells us. TIP is also encouraging engineers and companies to join by creating a \"culture\" working group that helps teach telecom engineers how to \"work fast and break things\" as the internet world does. \"One of things we learned in the last 1.5 years in working on TIP is people saying, 'How do you help me transform my culture and my team so that we can move faster?'\" Facebook's Parikh said. Telecom is a world that traditionally frowned on that. Working fast and breaking things could take down the network and get you fired. The culture group has become a popular entry point for engineers wanting to check out TIP. They then bring these ideas back to their jobs. It helps some engineers become more open minded about sharing. For others, like Le Gourrierec, it inspires \"a new sense of urgency,\" in his work at Nokia, he describes. We only heard one major criticism regularly lobbed at TIP: that Facebook is becoming extremely powerful. Maybe too powerful. After Facebook launched Voyager, Facebook dominated the gossip at the last Mobile World Congress, sources told us. Facebook Voyager optical network device Facebook There's good reason to worry. Facebook is making equipment with TIP and OCP, it's got state-of-the-art data centers, it has a roster of talented engineers and it's also laying its own telecom cable, including a new record-breaking fast subsea cable installed with Nokia between New York and Ireland. It could snap its fingers and become a powerful telecom and cloud operator tomorrow, some people fear (and others predict) like Amazon did with Amazon Web Services or Google did with Google Cloud and Google Fiber. But Parikh said that Facebook has zero interest in doing that. \"We aren't operating any networks ourselves. We are trying to help the telcos solve this,\" he said. The idea is to \"share\" lessons and technology to \"always benefits\" the whole community. SKT's Choi just shrugs off the idea that Facebook is a threat, saying telecom operators have more to gain than to lose. \"I can understand the concern. It's very much natural, because operators are always being disrupted,\" he said, especially by large American internet companies \"like Amazon, Google, and Facebook.\" Facebook's OpenCellular access point Facebook TIP \"But in the long run, I strongly believe in mutual benefits,\" he said. He notes that because Amazon helped create cloud computing, there are brand new billion-dollar markets and \"everyone benefits. I think the same thing will happen in the teleco sectors.\" Not everyone is convinced that TIP will succeed. IDC's Mehra cautions that it's a huge undertaking and the two biggest telecom equipment vendors, Ericsson and Huawei, have remained cool toward the project, for obvious reasons, he says. \"TIP may see progress over the years. But the challenges are higher. They are working on four to five different domains of telecom infrastructure, each with its own set of technologies and own set of tech providers,\" Mehra says. All the board members of TIP admit the project is in its early days and could fail. It could fail to attract a community. It could fail to produce products the world wants to use. But they believe it will succeed. \"Today most telecos remain as the status quo but all the telcos leadership, if you ask them, they want transformation. They want changes. They want innovation. They have to overcome it by collaborating with Facebook and others,\" he said. \"Again, witness all the innovations that have already happened in the cloud industry. We want to apply all those innovations to the telco industry, which will make operators happier and customer happier and for everyone, a win/win.\"",

Brendan McDermid/Reuters SoftBank's Vision Fund is officially the world's biggest private equity fund after it announced on Saturday that it had closed $93 billion. The extra $7 billion, bringing the fund's total to $100 billion, is expected to close in the next six months, SoftBank said in its announcement on Saturday. It's a colossal amount of capital collected to invest in the next wave of technology companies, and it's size and focus has attracted backers like Apple and Qualcomm as a result. The billions invested will be directed towards the tech industry, ranging from companies in artificial intelligence to robotics and cloud technology. The way the fund was publicized suggested that it intended to invest in startups and emerging technologies. In December, Son told President-elect Donald Trump that $50 billion of the fund would be invested in US startups and it would bring 50,000 jobs to the US as a result, according to Bloomberg . While startups will be a part of the fund, SoftBank said in the press release that it's going to be investing in \"established, multi-billion dollar companies requiring substantial growth funding\" as well. \"Technology has the potential to address the biggest challenges and risks facing humanity today. The businesses working to solve these problems will require patient long-term capital and visionary strategic investment partners with the resources to nurture their success,\" said SoftBank chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son in a press release. \"The SoftBank Vision Fund is consistent with this strategy and will help build and grow businesses creating the foundational platforms of the next stage of the Information Revolution.\" SoftBank announced the fund last October, saying that it would be based in London. Other high-profile backers now include Foxconn, Sharp, and the Mubadala Investment Company of the United Arab Emirates.",

    "content": "Fictional investors Thornston Grave Ventures, from HBO's \"Silicon Valley\". HBO This probably won't come as much of a surprise to female entrepreneurs who have tried to raise funding. Swedish researchers observing government venture capitalists over a year found that they described female and male investors quite differently, and not in a good way. According to the researchers' account in the Harvard Business Review, male entrepreneurs tended to get lots of positive language about their \"potential.\" These are the terms VCs used about men: The researchers highlighted how youth and enthusiasm were seen as positive attributes for men, but a sign of inexperience in women. Caution, even if it was a shared trait across the two genders, was also a good attribute in men, but a sign of weakness in women. VCs questioned women's credentials much more, and also focused on the way they looked. These are the terms they used to describe female entrepreneurs: The Lulea University of Technology researchers, Malin Malmstrom, Jeaneth Johansson, and Joakim Wincent, followed seven Swedish government VCs between 2009 and 2010 for their research and tracked 36 hours of decision-making time. The VCs comprised two women and five men. Part of the inspiration for their paper was how little government VC funding goes to women. The researchers said EU government VCs account for EUR3.6 billion of investment. In Sweden, 13% to 18% of government funding goes to female-founded firms, they said. They suggested that bias, and the way those biases were phrased, may have impacted whether women got funding. They wrote: \"Unsurprisingly, these stereotypes seem to have played a role in who got funding and who didn't. Women entrepreneurs were only awarded, on average, 25% of the applied-for amount, whereas men received, on average, 52% of what they asked for.\" They added that gender bias meant VCs might not invest in the most promising startups. \" This isn't only damaging for women entrepreneurs; it's potentially damaging for society as a whole,\" they concluded.",

    "content": "Anti-Brexit protesters outside Parliament on the day the Prime Minister triggered the process by which Britain will leave the European Union, in London, March 29, 2017. Reuters/Stefan Wermuth The European Investment Fund, which provides billions in funding to British venture capitalists, has frozen funding to UK VC firms after the Brexit vote. Business Insider understands that Seedcamp, Dawn Capital, Hoxton Ventures, and Episode 1 Ventures are among the firms affected. The shortfall means some of the companies are seeking other investors to build out their new funds. Two sources said the EIF is not handing funding to anyone who applied, or was in the process of applying, after the UK voted to leave the EU. But the EIF will honour its existing commitments to UK funds, Business Insider understands. London-based Episode 1 Ventures is raising a new fund between PS50 million and PS60 million. It applied to the EIF for funding before the UK referendum, and was rejected after the triggering of Article 50 to leave the EU. Theresa May triggers the process of leaving the EU. REUTERS/Christopher Furlong/Pool Simon Murdoch, the firm's managing partner, described the EIF as \"a great institution\", and said the slowing of funding was \"another great example of the disaster of Brexit.\" He told Business Insider: \"Until Theresa May said that we would trigger Article 50 [to leave the EU], in all that time, the EIF engaged with us in a fair and diligent way. Then after meeting them in January, they just went silent. Then we triggered Article 50 and the EIF [said] it wasn't going ahead with us.\" He added: \"We suspect that if [the UK] hadn't triggered Article 50, we would have had a much better chance. We can't be sure. But we think leaving the EU and Article 50 was instrumental in us being turned down.\" The EIF has denied pulling out of the UK altogether. A spokesman told Business Insider: \"There is no moratorium on lending to UK projects. It is the case that due diligence on them now needs to take into account a wider range of factors.\" Sources said the EIF had privately been giving out mixed messages to VC firms. They said the EIF's proclaimed changes to its due diligence process allowed it to \"obfuscate\" the fact it was halting investment. Seedcamp cofounder Reshma Sohoni. Seedcamp Take the example of Seedcamp. The pre-seed and seed-stage investor is in the process of raising a new fund, and was undergoing the EIF's due diligence process. The fund was told this week that that process would now be \"indefinite,\" a source said. Seedcamp did not comment, but did confirm it was in the due diligence process. \"What might happen is that the EIF will say 'Maybe, maybe, maybe', and then Seedcamp will close without them,\" one source said. \"That's a nice way to say: 'We didn't say no.' It's not a yes either.\" Another said that the EIF wouldn't fund anyone who hadn't already received a final approval letter. Dawn Capital and Hoxton Ventures did not comment. One of the sources said the EIF had decided not to expand a EUR250 million (PS214 million) angel investment scheme to the UK, after the decision to leave the EU. The European Angels Fund is a co-investment scheme where the EIF will match investments by business angels into startups, then allow them to keep the bulk of the profit from the deal. It's available in seven EU member states and, the source said, was due to expand to the UK this year. The source said the EIF had planned making EUR50 million (PS43 million) available to British angels for early-stage deals. That \"died\" after the Brexit vote, the person said. The European Investment Fund is seen as an \"anchor\" investor for British venture capitalists who are raising new funds. It has put EUR2.3 billion (PS1.9 billion) into 144 UK venture capital firms between 2011 and 2015, according to internal figures. VC funds are designed to have a ten-year lifespan, at the end of which investors expect to see a return through an exit. About three to four years through that lifespan, VCs will begin raising a new fund. The EIF is controlled by the European Investment Bank. Eric Vidal/Reuters And, as multiple sources told Business Insider, it's hard work. Most investors don't want to invest in a new fund until it's already closed. This is where schemes like the EIF and the UK's closest equivalent, the British Business Bank, come in. They will often be the \"single-largest cheque\" to a fund, accounting for up to 40%. Once fund managers have that commitment, they can dredge up funding more easily from other sources. If the EIF decides not to act as an anchor investor, life for UK VCs becomes much tougher in the medium term. \"It's a significant chunk of UK VC,\" as one investor said. And it won't just impact smaller scale VCs, but other major UK-based firms like Balderton and Atomico, which also rely on the EIF for funding. The Conservative manifesto this week pledged to make up for any shortfall in EIF funding to UK VCs. Since the UK contributes to the EIF via the fund's main shareholder, the European Investment Bank, the Conservative plan is to repatriate those funds and hand them out via the British Business Bank. This is what UK VCs will have been hoping for. Saul Klein, general partner at investment firm LocalGlobe, said at an event last week that British and institutional investors \"will make up the difference\" in any EIF shortfall. Not everyone is convinced that can happen. \"There's zero chance of that happening,\" said Episode 1 Ventures' Murdoch, who believes the UK's European Investment Bank assets will have to go towards its EU divorce bill. \"The Tories saying this are in cloud cuckoo land.\"",

    "content": "GV general partner Krishna Yeshwant GV Dr. Krishna Yeshwant has a lot on his plate. In addition to practicing internal medicine, Yeshwant is a general partner at GV (formerly Google Ventures), where he leads the Life Sciences team. His team has invested in companies like 23andMe, Foundation Medicine, and Flatiron Health. And Yeshwant's not the only one on his team that's active in his field. Another team member works as a researcher at Harvard, another is a professor at Dartmouth, and one is also a physician. It wasn't necessarily a conscious choice to hire in people who still had another job, but they soon realized that as life science investors, they could take advantage of the observations they made at their other gigs. \"You need to be in the field to see how it's evolving,\" Yeshwant said. \"In the investor role, you make an investment, then you don't know what happens for five years, seven years, 10 years, and so you can often 'drink your own Kool-aid.'\" Because Yeshwant's with patients frequently, he can't be all that removed. \"In the end, it's always a good reminder that this stuff has to get to a patient to be in any way meaningful,\" he said. One example of a time when Yeshwant took his experience in the doctor's office and applied it to an investment was Quartet Health, a New York-based behavioral health startup. Yeshwant had noticed that patients were coming in with physical health complaints, such as a rash or joint pain, but there often wasn't enough time to address some of the mental conditions that could be playing a role in these physical problems. \"We often don't talk about the underlying depression, the anxiety, the issues that actually ultimately affect all those other conditions,\" he said. GV spent years looking for companies that could tackle that before coming across Quartet. It's also informed what he's on the look-out for in future investments, including adherence, or making sure patients take their prescribed medication, and physician burnout.",

    "content": "Chorus founder and CEO Dick Costolo Ethan Miller/Getty Images To build a world-class tech company, you need top talent, and you have to be willing to pay the price to get it. At least that's the word from Dick Costolo. To succeed, tech companies need to attract \"really world-class engineers,\" the former Twitter CEO told TV commentator and author Suzy Welch in an interview published on LinkedIn. Those are the people who really make a tech company, and they are \"worth their weight in gold,\" he said. \"A great engineer can be worth ten times a 'regular' engineer, or 30, 40, 50, or 100 times,\" Costolo said. \"These are the very special engineers that the top companies are seeking. That's the game.\" What makes these top engineers so special is not just that they have a mastery of engineering principals and technical skills, but more they think creatively and have solved problems no one has solved before, Costolo said. They are the Einsteins of the tech engineer world. Costolo knows something about building a tech company. He's credited with steering Twitter through its breathtaking growth phase and its spectacular IPO. After stepping down as CEO when the pitchforks came out over Twitter's slowing growth, he's back in the game of building a young tech company, working at health tech startup Chorus. Chorus has created an app that's designed to motivate users to workout, train, and accomplish big fitness goals. The focus on rock-star engineers helps to explain Silicon Valley's continual complaints about there being a talent crunch even as big tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter are swimming in job applicants. Big companies are most concerned with finding top talent, not just people who know a particular programming language. Tech companies have gotten so aggressive about finding those rocks starts they've begun prowling colleges, or sometimes even high schools, Costolo said. And when they find one, they pull out all the stops to woo them. Costolo told the story of how he, as Twitter's CEO, personally recruited a senior from Princeton. While on the phone with her, he realized he wasn't even the only CEO of a big internet company who had called her. Wait, CEOs of multi-billion companies are calling up college seniors? \"This was not happening when I was in college,\" Costolo said. As the competition for top engineers has ramped up, those programmers have also gotten more savvy about negotiating their pay packages, particularly their stock options, he said. As you might expect, all this fawning and those large paychecks can have their consequences. Some of these folks develop big egos. For all the talk of Valley companies wanting to build great corporate cultures, they often look the other way when it comes to the personalities of these star engineers, Costolo said. \"A lot these companies will say, 'No brilliant jerks,' and generally, they would prefer not to have brilliant jerks, but when you're trying to get world-class engineers, there's a lot you'll overlook,\" he said. That could explain a lot about the state of Silicon Valley's these days. Many companies are touting themselves as warm and tolerant places. But we've seen repeated stories from inside particular ones claiming they have instituted a \"culture of fear\" or a \"bruising culture\" or \"aggressive culture.\" If some of the most valuable employees are actually \"brilliant jerks,\" that can't help but impact the workplace.",

Business Insider Tinder VP of product Ankur Jain, who joined the online-dating behemoth a year ago when it purchased his startup, is leaving the company, Business Insider has learned. His departure will go into effect on June 2. Last March, Tinder bought Humin, a startup created by Jain that primarily consisted of a contact-management app by the same name and a social networking app called Knock Knock, both of which were discontinued following the sale. The Humin app was basically a personal assistant that specialized in remembering all the tiny details when you meet somebody new, allowing you to later look that person up based on context search cues like \"lives in Manhattan\" or \"emailed last week.\" The startup had raised $15 million, and was acquired by Tinder for an undisclosed sum. When Tinder bought Humin, the idea seemed to be to expand beyond the dating sphere, which Tinder has tried through the launch of things like \"Tinder Social\" -- though none of those efforts have caught fire like its dating elements. Jain was also rumored to be behind the unannounced Tinder for VIPs and celebs, called Tinder Select, the existence of which was first revealed in leaked screenshots from early users. In his post-Tinder life, Jain will work on Kairos Society Ventures, his new seed-stage venture fund. The fund is an offshoot of Kairos Society, a group of young entrepreneurs Jain founded while at Wharton in 2008, which is designed to \"tackle some of the biggest problems\" in the world. Jain is the son of well-known tech entrepreneur Naveen Jain, who is also on the board of Kairos Society. Business Insider has reached out to both Tinder and Jain for comment.",

    "content": "SoftBank managing director Deep Nishar Thomson Reuters (Reuters) - Deep Nishar spends more time roaming university hallways than he does corporate boardrooms. A former electrical engineer who helped develop Google's mobile phone business and grow LinkedIn's users from 30 million to half a billion, Nishar is exactly the sort of industry specialist that SoftBank Group Corp CEO Masayoshi Son wants for his new $100 billion technology investment vehicle. Son, Japan's richest man, is expected to announce on Saturday the close of the first fundraising round for what will be the world's biggest private equity fund. Its backers, including Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and Apple Inc , expect technology investments that will match or beat the 44 percent internal rate of return that SoftBank says Son has delivered by investing in internet companies in the last 18 years. With pitfalls aplenty among the valuation-rich, profit-poor start-ups of Silicon Valley, Son is seeking to hire dealmakers who can spot the most commercially disruptive technologies, according to people close to him. As he builds up the Vision Fund, Son has hired a roster of investment bankers, including Alex Clavel, a longtime telecommunications banker at Morgan Stanley , and technology banker Ervin Tu of Goldman Sachs Group Inc . Son is looking for industry wonks to complement those hires and find potentially game-changing investments in areas ranging from genomics and artificial intelligence to robots and the internet-of-things. The sources asked not to be identified ahead of the conclusion of the fundraising. SoftBank Group Corp. Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son smiles during an earnings briefing in Tokyo, Japan, July 28, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Nishar, 47, is the most senior industry expert working for SoftBank, which he joined in 2015. He sits on SoftBank's investment committee, which includes Son, SoftBank chief financial officer Alok Sama, SoftBank board director Ronald Fisher, and head of the Vision Fund, Rajeev Misra. SoftBank has yet to finalize the investment committee for the Vision Fund, which it will manage. Even when he was working at LinkedIn and Google, Nishar had an interest in investing. The Indian-born engineer spent five years tracking the business of pre-cancer detection startup Guardant Health. He visited researchers in universities and even showed up in doctors' offices to see which tests they prescribed to detect cancer. When Guardant sought to raise money in 2016, Nishar had an inside track. He arranged a meeting between Guardant's founders and Son at SoftBank's San Carlos office near San Francisco. Last week, SoftBank said it would lead a $360 million fundraising round for Guardant, with Son praising it as a potential \"Rosetta Stone\" of cancer. Guardant co-founder and CEO Helmy Eltoukhy said Nishar's business experience and technical expertise made him stand out from other investment professionals. \"This kind of experience, from the engineering side as well as business side, is hard to come by,\" he said. Nishar has four people on his team, which focuses on so-called frontier technologies, such as computational biology. He is looking to double that by the end of the year, according to people familiar with the plans. SoftBank also wants experts in other sectors, including enterprise software, artificial intelligence, robotics, digital media and financial technology, according to the sources. Other sector specialists working for SoftBank include David Thevenon, a former Google executive who handles ride-sharing investments for SoftBank, such as Didi in China, Ola in India, and Grab in Southeast Asia, and Kabir Misra, an e-commerce specialist who is helping put together the merger of Flipkart and Snapdeal in India. Son is building his team as technology investing has become increasingly competitive. Google and other technology companies are looking to invest in the areas SoftBank is focusing on, as are private equity and venture capital funds. The dealmaking team SoftBank is building will also be pivotal for 59-year-old Son's own legacy and eventual transition, after Nikesh Arora, a former Google executive he had named as his successor, resigned last year. A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, Son does not subscribe to the traditional Japanese business culture of pecking order and hierarchy, leaving plenty of scope for people in this team to pitch investment ideas to him. \"Son is not terribly hierarchical. If you know something more than him on a particular topic, you will get air time, he will listen to you,\" said Raine Group LLC co-founder Jeff Sine, Son's most trusted investment banking adviser, who has participated in most of his deals. Reuters/ Lucas Jackson Son is the only individual listed as \"key man\" for the Vision Fund, meaning that, no matter how many dealmakers he hires, he is responsible for all the investment decisions, and the fund could be dissolved in his absence. Many of the hirings happen through personal connections; Nishar, for example, was recruited by Arora, based on their ties going back to Google. With so much in-house dealmaking expertise, investment bankers who have been trying to cultivate Son's lieutenants are fretting over whether they will be hired to work on any of the Vision Fund's deals. People close to Son say he will meet with all major investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co , but will only hire them if they bring expertise he does not already have. \"As an investment banker, you need deep expertise in the specific set of skills Son has hired you for to be useful, because his team is extremely smart,\" said Robey Warshaw LLP co-founder Simon Robey, an investment banker who helped SoftBank navigate British takeover rules to clinch a $32 billion deal to acquire chip designer ARM Holdings.

    "content": "Drive Tribe. Drive Tribe The boss of Jeremy Clarkson's social network for cars has left just six months after the website launched. Drive Tribe CEO Ernesto Schmitt confirmed to Business Insider that he is no longer in charge. Schmitt said \"all's well\" and he remains an \"active shareholder\" in the company, as well as an advisor. Schmitt exited some time ago, but his departure was not announced and a Companies House \"termination of appointment\" notice was only published this week. Drive Tribe went live in November 2016, positioning itself as a digital hub for motoring. It hosts video, articles, social media, and interactive content, which is all organised around channels, known as \"tribes,\" with a unique tone of voice. Clarkson, his \"Grand Tour\" co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May, and the Amazon Prime show's executive producer Andy Wilman, are all personally invested in the startup. It also has $12 million (PS9.2 million) of funding from backers including 21st Century Fox and Jim Breyer, one of the first investors in Facebook. Wilman said it was Schmitt's decision to step down and it's all \"happy families\" at the company. \"The thing that he brought was what kind of tech and approach we should take,\" he told Business Insider. \"He opened our eyes to what we could do. But he wanted to set it up and then move on. That's been done.\" Former Drive Tribe CEO Ernesto Schmitt. Ernesto Schmitt Wilman added that Drive Tribe is on the hunt for a new chief executive and there are as many as four candidates in the frame. A headhunter is assisting with the search. \"Can you imagine the four of us looking for a digital tech CEO?\" he joked. \"We're allowed to be involved in the interviewing, but cleverer people have done the interviewing before us.\" Engagement in Drive Tribe is \"encouraging,\" Wilman said, adding that it is becoming less dependent on Clarkson, Hammond, and May -- which was always the original ambition. He explained: \"There's a graph going diagonally. In the beginning, it was very James, Jeremy, and Richard-centric, but the tribe thing is gathering pace. The one thing we didn't want was another business where the dependence is on them. It's going well, I'm happy.\" Their ambitions are clear. Hammond told Business Insider last year that success for Drive Tribe is \"having the widest, deepest, richest seem of motor-related content and interactivity ever seen.\"",

    "content": "Anthony Levandowski. Otto Uber is threatening to fire the engineer at the centre of its legal battle with Alphabet's self-driving-car firm Waymo unless he hands over documents from his previous employer. Anthony Levandowski previously worked at Waymo, which is owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, to help develop autonomous vehicle tech. But he subsequently left to create his own self-driving-truck startup, Otto, which Uber acquired for $680 million. Alphabet and Waymo have accused Uber and Otto of stealing Waymo's trade secrets and intellectual property and of infringing on patents related to lidar, a technology that autonomous vehicles use to \"see.\" Uber denies the allegations. Waymo is accusing Levandowski of downloading more than 14,000 files while working for the company in 2015 and taking them with him. But Levandowski is refusing to let the devices that might contain the files be searched, asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Uber has already demoted Levandowski and removed him from any work involving lidar systems at Uber. But after receiving a court order to return any documents taken from Waymo, Uber is threatening to fire Levandowski if he does not cooperate. \"We understand that this letter requires you to turn over information wherever located, including but not limited to, your personal devices, and to waive any Fifth Amendment protection you may have,\" Uber's general counsel, Salle Yoo, wrote in a letter on Monday that was made public in a court filing Thursday. \"While we have respected your personal liberties, it is our view that the Court's Order requires us to make these demands of you.\" She went on: \"If you do not agree to comply with all of the requirements set forth herein, or if you fail to comply in a material manner, then Uber will take adverse employment action against you, which may include termination of your employment and such termination would be for Cause.\" But Levandowski's lawyers say the demand is unconstitutional. They wrote that court order forcing Uber to make the demand of him was \"an act by the judicial branch of our federal government compelling an individual to choose between preserving his livelihood and preserving his constitutional rights.\" They continued: \"Nearly fifty years of Supreme Court precedent forbid the government from putting an individual to such an unconstitutionally coercive choice.\" An Uber representative did not immediately comment when contacted by Business Insider. Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing the trial, has also previously referred the case to the US attorney's office for a potential criminal investigation. The case comes at a critical time for Uber. The ride-hailing company is reeling from multiple scandals, including allegations of sexual harassment at the company, and numerous high-level executives have left in recent months. CEO Travis Kalanick is pinning the future of his company on its self-driving-car unit, and he has said failing to be first to develop the tech could pose an existential threat to Uber. \"If we are not tied for first, then the person who is in first, or the entity that's in first, then rolls out a ride-sharing network that is far cheaper or far higher-quality than Uber's, then Uber is no longer a thing,\" he said.",

    "content": "Working at a startup means you're able to change course quickly. Pexels When a business is looking for funding and they get rejected by a bank, they are now more likely to head to the internet. Funding Options is a price comparison site for this exact scenario, working a bit like a dating site to match lenders with businesses depending on their specific needs. According to founder and CEO Conrad Ford, Funding Options finances tens of millions of pounds in finance to businesses each year from some of the biggest lenders out there. But the company wasn't always so lucrative. Funding Options went through a few tough years when it began. \"There's a few startups in fintech that seem to have got things right on day one and exploded from there and became unicorns,\" Ford told Business Insider. \"We certainly weren't in that category. It was two or three years before the torch paper lit and we fired into life.\" Business Insider sat down with Ford to discuss his story and what he would recommend graduates do if they're looking to get into the fintech industry. Here are 8 pieces of advice he learned from his own experiences. If you want to get into the fintech world but you've also been offered a job at a big financial institution, Ford says you should always take it. \"I personally think that in the very early stages of your career, unless you're extraordinarily entrepreneurial, joining a large institution that has a graduate program, it's probably the best thing you can possibly do,\" he said. In short, after three years you will have made a lot of money and gone through a very structured program, which taught you technical skills around the industry. Ford says it's also good practice to learn how to behave in an office. Moreover, you'll be better equipped to take risks. \"The world of constant change is only going to accelerate, it's not like the opportunities won't be here in three years time,\" Ford said. \"And you'll probably be better prepared for them when you've done that.\" When Ford worked in strategy for a major bank, it was very much a case of making small changes and having more or less a certainty of the outcome. When he started up Funding Options, he quickly worked out that the vast majority of what he thought to be true turned out not to be. \"I did customer surveys, I did desktop research, all these expert skills I learned at large institutions,\" he said. \"Every piece of desktop research told me something was a great opportunity, then when I tried it in the real world, it failed miserably.\" According to Ford, no business plan will survive the first contact with a customer. So there's no point worrying about making something perfect the first time around. \"To survive and to make a startup work, you need to be like a motor boat,\" he said. \"You need to take advantage of the fact you can whiz around and change course. You don't have that inherent momentum [like a bank] but you can afford to get it wrong. So getting it wrong and failing fast is really important.\" At a bank, Ford says he could work for endless amounts of time on a project. When starting up Funding Options, the team worked for about a year before releasing it to the public, only for it to fail. In hindsight, Ford says he could have learned just as much if they had launched on day one. \"It was just learning the brutally hard way with other people's money and wasting a year of my life,\" he said. \"You have to be fast and agile. That was the biggest challenge for me.\" Conrad Ford in the Funding Options office. Funding Options Funding Options has seen a 14-fold increase in revenues over the past couple of years. Ford puts this down to not raising too much money too early on in its genesis. \"I'm kind of glad that I didn't immediately raise lots of money early on, because I would have taken just as long to learn some stuff, and spent a lot of other people's money along the way,\" he said. Also, when a company raises a lot of money, the team generally grows along with it. Funding Options is currently at about 25 employees, and Ford likes it this way because it means there are no politics or back-stabbings going on. He calls it the company's \"strict no d***heads policy.\" Ford says he found a resilience in himself he ever knew he had when starting Funding Options. In the first two or three tough years, when things weren't going to plan, he discovered how to deal with the things that are -- in the startup world -- a matter of life or death. \"Nothing can prepare you for not being sure whether you can pay your staff the next day,\" Ford said. \"Or not being sure if that funding round is going to close, then literally you're down to you last PS5000 or whatever it might be in the bank account.\" He says he asks people that want to join the company whether they are psychologically happy with treating a job at a startup like it's temporary. Working at a startup may sound glamorous, but it's also a massive risk that you need to be prepared for. Things are going well for Funding Options right now, but Ford often thinks about all the things that could still fail. \"I've never lost the view of the world that says one day I'm going to wake up and something is going to go fundamentally wrong,\" he said. \"I think it's stupid to get complacent.\" Fintech isn't something that appeared out of nowhere. There was a time when ATMs didn't exist, and when they came out they were massively innovative. Ford says fintech has always been around, but the rate of its evolution has accelerated recently. When the next big thing comes along, Ford is confident that Funding Options will be able to adapt to it. \"We're still small and scrappy enough that we're still used to things going wrong,\" he said. \"I don't think there's something that's going to happen that quickly that we can't respond to it. We are a technology company, there's nothing technological we couldn't do.\"",

    "content": "Screenshot LONDON -- The chief technology officer of digital bank Tandem quietly left the startup in December. James Greenwood left the startup in December and is now working as the CTO of CLEARLY, a digital challenger bank based in Dubai. Greenwood had been Tandem's CTO since its founding in 2014, working on building the back end for Tandem's banking app. Greenwood was named 'Rising Star Banker of the Year 2015' by Retail Banker International for his work building Tandem's platform. Tandem declined to comment on Greenwood's departure. A quick LinkedIn search reveals that Paul Clark has been promoted to the role of CTO at the startup. Clark was previously VP of engineering at Tandem and was formerly chief engineer at HSBC and head of engineering at ITV. Asked for comment on his exit, Greenwood said in an email from Dubai: \"Having gained great experience in the challenger bank market in the UK, leveraging that makes a lot of sense -- bringing a similar step-change in financial services to such a dynamic region; it was both an opportunity and challenge to relish.\" Greenwood's exit is the second departure from Tandem's executive team in the last 6 months. CEO Peter Herbert left in January and was replaced in the role by founder Ricky Knox. Tandem, which has yet to launch to the public, has gone through a turbulent few months. The startup thought it had secured PS35 million in funding from House of Fraser in December. However, new capital controls in China led the department store's Chinese owners to pull out of the deal after just PS6 million was invested. The funding shortfall led Tandem to temporarily lose its banking licence and forced it to delay its launch to the public. The startup has also reduced its headcount from around 120 at the end of last year to close to 80. Knox told Business Insider recently that Tandem is in \"advanced\" talks to secure more funding and plans to launch its credit cards to the public imminently. The startup has raised over PS25 million to date from investors including eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.",

    "content": "GV general partner Krishna YeshwantGV When it comes to investing in the biotech and health-tech startups, it can be hard to find a company that can turn an idea into a reality. For one, developing new treatments is no small feat. And there is often a lot of interest concentrated on certain \"buzzy\" areas like immunotherapy or machine learning. GV, formerly Google Ventures, has invested in a number of life sciences startups, including 23andMe, Foundation Medicine, and Flatiron Health. The life sciences team focuses on areas that are what Dr. Krishna Yeshwant said can look \"nontraditional.\" There are a few key areas Yeshwant, a GV general partner who leads the Life Sciences team, told Business Insider he's looking to invest in, providing he finds the right company. But just because GV is interested in these topics doesn't mean there will be any rush to invest in them immediately. For some things, like adherence, Yeshwant said GV has spent two to three years looking for something. \"We've seen too many companies that are scanner, a pill-counter, electronic reminder, none of which we found to be fully compelling yet,\" Yeshwant said. And that's typically the case for most of GV's life science investments. That way, when a company that fits the bill does surface, the team is ready to move quickly. One example Yeshwant gave was GV's investment in Quartet Health, a New York-based behavioral health startup. Yeshwant, a practicing physician, had noticed that patients were coming in with physical health complaints, such as a rash or joint pain. \"We often don't talk about the underlying depression, the anxiety, the issues that actually ultimately affect all those other conditions,\" he said. GV spent years looking for companies that could tackle that before coming across Quartet.",

    "content": "Travis Kalanick/Twitter There are already a lot of companies that call themselves the \"Uber for trucking\" -- and now Uber itself is one of them. On Thursday, the $69 billion ride-hailing giant officially launched Uber Freight, its new network for helping truck drivers find loads easier and pay them faster. Given the number of startups already vying to be the solution, it's not a new idea to revolutionize the trucking industry. But Uber is a well-financed behemoth entering the $700 billion trucking industry that experts predict may give it the advantage over the other upstarts -- and it has an ulterior motive as well. The plan builds on Uber's acquisition of Otto, a self-driving trucking company that Uber bought in July for $650 million. (That same company is also the target of a massive lawsuit brought by Waymo that could impair Uber's future self-driving car efforts). At the time, Otto's main focus was to build self-driving truck kits that equipment manufacturers or freight networks could buy and install on their own, but it also secretly harbored a desire to build its own \"Uber for trucking\" marketplace. \"Even if you look pre-acquisition, Otto was always about reinventing transportation,\" Eric Berdinis, the product lead on Uber Freight, told Business Insider in October when Uber first started teasing the launch. \"Even though we started with the announcement of the self-driving trucks, we were always intending to build a marketplace that would allow self-driving trucks to flourish.\" For now, Uber Freight is limited to trucks that are driven by humans that are vetted by the company to be certified to drive the different kind of trucking loads on the platform -- some which may require refrigeration or special equipment. It's also starting small just operating in Texas between Houston, Dallas, and Austin, according to Wired. Amid concerns that Uber's self-driving trucks have vanished from the road, the launch of Uber Freight shows it hasn't abandoned its push into trucking wholeheartedly.",

    "content": "The Federal Communications Commission's chairman, Ajit Pai. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The Federal Communication Commission on Thursday voted to initiate the process of undoing the net-neutrality rules put in place during the Obama administration. The vote fell 2-1 along party lines, with Republicans Ajit Pai, the chairman, and Michael O'Rielly voting in favor of Pai's proposal to reverse the rules. Democrat Mignon Clyburn voted against. The vote does not mean the existing net-neutrality rules are dead. Instead, the FCC will now seek further public comment before finalizing an order that would undo the rules in earnest. That order will require another vote, most likely later this year. Even if the commission passes that order, that wouldn't necessarily end the matter. The new rules will almost certainly be challenged in court by proponents of the Obama-era rules. That could be an extended process. It took about 10 months for the current net-neutrality rules to go from proposal to official policy, then another 15 months to be upheld in court. But the vote Thursday has fired the starting gun. Today's net-neutrality rules classify internet service providers like Comcast and Verizon as utility-like \"common carriers\" under Title II of the Communications Act. That classification gave the FCC broad authority to dictate what ISPs could do within their networks. Democratic commissioner Mignon Clyburn, Pai, and Republican commissioner Michael O'Rielly. FCC Most notably, the FCC used that Title II authority to preemptively ban ISPs from blocking, slowing the speeds of, or prioritizing certain traffic on their network for financial gain. AT&T, for instance, cannot slow down Google's YouTube TV service so that it's less appealing than its own DirecTV Now service. Nor can it let Google pay a fee for faster speeds, something a startup would be less capable of doing. Pai's proposal aims to strip that Title II classification for ISPs and reverse them back to being Title I \"information service providers.\" That is what they were considered before the current rules. Pai says the expanded FCC authority -- including a \"general conduct\" rule that lets the FCC strike down future abuses that aren't explicitly covered by the official rules -- has depressed ISPs' willingness to invest in their networks. Pai's proposal expresses support for the \"no blocking\" rule but seeks comment on whether any of the core net-neutrality rules are necessary. Republicans and various ISPs feel it's best to punish any abuses after the fact, instead of preemptively eliminating the possibility of misconduct with what they see as heavy-handed regulation. Proponents of net neutrality protesting against Pai outside the American Enterprise Institute before his arrival May 5 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Proponents of the current rules -- namely Democrats, consumer-advocacy groups, and internet-based companies both big and small -- say Title II authority is necessary to actually enforce net neutrality, and they argue that network investment has not been harmed by the Obama-era rules. Weakening those rules would open the door for ISPs to play favorites, and thus stifle competition, they say. Clyburn, for one, decried Pai's proposal as a \"hollow theory of trickle-down economics\" at the FCC's public meeting on Thursday. Major ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T have said they will not block or throttle content should the rules be reversed. The FCC twice tried to impose net-neutrality rules using Title I authority before the current rules were enacted in 2015, and it was defeated in court by ISP lawsuits on both occasions. Pai has said he would welcome congressional action that would turn net-neutrality principles into law, though it's not clear what such a bill would look like with the ongoing gridlock in Washington. Eric Gaillard/Reuters In any case, the debate is a heated one. Various Democrats in Congress have pledged to protest Pai's intentions, and some consumer-advocacy groups have already disrupted FCC meetings in support of the Obama-era rules. More than 2.1 million public comments have already been filed since Pai issued his notice of proposed rulemaking -- many spurred by comedian John Oliver's call to preserve the rules -- though hundreds of thousands of those comments appear to have been generated by bots, bringing their authenticity into question. Expect things to intensify on both the internet and Capitol Hill from here.",

    "content": "Tesla's Fremont factory.Tesla When Tesla bought a decommissioned car factory in Fremont, California, Elon Musk transformed the old-fashioned, unionized plant into a much-vaunted \"factory of the future\", where giant robots named after X-Men shape and fold sheets of metal inside a gleaming white mecca of advanced manufacturing. The appetite for Musk's electric cars, and his promise to disrupt the carbon-reliant automobile industry, has helped Tesla's value exceed that of both Ford and, briefly, General Motors (GM). But some of the human workers who share the factory with their robotic counterparts complain of grueling work pressure they attribute to Musk's aggressive production goals, and sometimes life-changing injuries. Ambulances have been called more than 100 times since 2014 for workers experiencing fainting spells, dizziness, seizures, abnormal breathing and chest pains, according to incident reports obtained by the Guardian. Hundreds more were called for injuries and other medical issues. In a phone interview about the conditions at the factory, which employs some 10,000 workers, the Tesla CEO conceded his workers had been \"having a hard time, working long hours, and on hard jobs\", but said he cared deeply about their health and wellbeing. His company says its factory safety record has significantly improved over the last year. Musk also said that Tesla should not be compared to major US carmakers and that its market capitalization, now more than $50bn, is unwarranted. \"I do believe this market cap is higher than we have any right to deserve,\" he said, pointing out his company produces just 1% of GM's total output. \"We're a money losing company,\" Musk added. \"This is not some situation where, for example, we are just greedy capitalists who decided to skimp on safety in order to have more profits and dividends and that kind of thing. It's just a question of how much money we lose. And how do we survive? How do we not die and have everyone lose their jobs?\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Scott Olson/Getty Images Musk's account of the company's approach differs from that of the 15 current and former factory workers who told the Guardian of a culture which they described as requiring working long hours under intense pressure, sometimes through pain and injury, in order to fulfill the CEO's ambitious production goals. \"I've seen people pass out, hit the floor like a pancake and smash their face open,\" said Jonathan Galescu, a production technician at Tesla. \"They just send us to work around him while he's still laying on the floor.\" He was one of several workers who said they had seen co-workers collapse or be taken away in ambulances. \"We had an associate on my line, he just kept working, kept working, kept working, next thing you know -- he just fell on the ground,\" said Mikey Catura, a worker on the battery pack line. Richard Ortiz, another production worker, spoke admiringly of the high-tech shop floor. \"It's like you died and went to auto-worker heaven.\" But he added: \"Everything feels like the future but us.\" Tesla sits at the juncture between a tech startup, untethered from the rules of the old economy, and a manufacturer that needs to produce physical goods. Nowhere is that contradiction more apparent than at the Tesla factory, where Musk's bombastic projection that his company will make 500,000 cars in 2018 (a 495% increase from 2016) relies as much on the sweat and muscle of thousands of human workers as it does on futuristic robots. Factory robots work on a Tesla Model S.via Youtube \"From what I've gathered, Elon Musk started Tesla kind of like an app startup and didn't realize that it isn't just nerds at a computer desk typing,\" said one production worker, one of several who asked not to be identified by name. \"You really start losing the startup feel when you have thousands of people doing physical labor.\" In February, Tesla worker Jose Moran published a blog post that detailed allegations of mandatory overtime, high rates of injury and low wages at the factory, and revealed that workers were seeking to unionize with the United Auto Workers. Moran's post shone a spotlight on a workforce that is almost entirely absent from Tesla's official images of the factory. Michael Sanchez once had two dreams: to be an artist and a car service technician. He said he was \"ecstatic\" when he was recruited five years ago to work at Tesla, a company he believed was \"part of the future.\" Now Sanchez has two herniated discs in his neck, is on disability leave from work, and can no longer grip a pencil without pain. Tesla said that the employee's injury occurred while he was installing a wheel, but Sanchez said it was caused by the years he spent working on Tesla's assembly line. The cars he worked on were suspended above the line, and his job required looking up and working with his hands above his head all day. \"You can make it through Monday,\" Sanchez said. \"You can make it through Tuesday. Come Wednesday you start to feel something. Thursday is pain. Friday is agonizing. Saturday you're just making it through the day.\" Tesla's manufacturing practices appear to have been most dangerous in its earliest years of operations. The company does not dispute that its recordable incident rate (TRIR), an official measure of injuries and illnesses that is reported to workplace safety regulators, was above the industry average between 2013 and 2016. Tesla declined to release data over those four years, saying such information \"doesn't reflect how the factory operates today.\" Tesla's Model X faced three years of production delays.Harold Cunningham/Getty Images The company did release more recent data, which indicates its record of safety incidents went from slightly above the industry average in late 2016, to a performance in the first few months of 2017 that was 32% better than average. The company said that its decision to add a third shift, introduce a dedicated team of ergonomics experts, and improvements to the factory's \"safety teams\" account for the significant reduction in incidents since last year. Musk said safety was paramount at the company. \"It's incredibly hurtful and I think false for anyone to claim that I don't care.\" The CEO said his desk was \"in the worst place in the factory, the most painful place\", in keeping with his management philosophy. \"It's not some comfortable corner office.\" In early 2016, he said, he slept on the factory floor in a sleeping bag \"to make it the most painful thing possible.\" \"I knew people were having a hard time, working long hours, and on hard jobs. I wanted to work harder than they did, to put even more hours in,\" he said. \"Because that's what I think a manager should do.\" He added: \"We're doing this because we believe in a sustainable energy future, trying to accelerate the advent of clean transport and clean energy production, not because we think this is a way to get rich.\" Tesla workers who spoke to the Guardian echoed this sense of pride and enthusiasm for the company's mission. \"We're changing the world,\" enthused Ortiz. \"I can't wait for my granddaughter to one day go to class and say, 'My grandfather was in there.'\" But that pride did not erase what Ortiz described as a prevailing mood of \"mass disappointment\" over working conditions and what he alleged were avoidable work-related injuries. He recently lost the strength in his right arm, a situation he said was \"scaring\" him. \"I want to use my arm when I'm retired,\" he added. Others described repetitive stress injuries they linked to working long hours. Before the company reduced the average time of a workday in October 2016, workers said they routinely worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week. Tesla said the change had been \"a success\", and resulted in a 50% decline in overtime hours. People wait in line outside a Tesla Motors store to place deposits on the electric car company's mid-priced Model 3.REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni Sanchez and other workers said they believed more injuries occurred because, for years, the company did not take worker safety seriously, with some managers belittling their complaints and pressuring them to work through pain. When workers told managers about pain, Sanchez said they responded: \"We all hurt. You can't man up?\" Alan Ochoa, another Tesla worker who is currently on a medical leave with an injury, alleged that superiors \"put the production numbers ahead of the safety and wellbeing of the employees.\" The company said that Ochoa and Sanchez are especially outspoken workers whose views do not represent the wider workforce. However, the Tesla spokesperson added: \"In a factory of more than 10,000 employees, there will always be isolated incidents that we would like to avoid.\" Complaints about working conditions at Tesla are not universal. \"I've got benefits, I've got stocks, I've got [paid time off],\" said a worker who has been at the company for about a year. \"I thoroughly enjoy my work and I feel I'm treated fairly.\" Another worker, a temporary employee, said that he sees some teams in the factory doing group stretches in the morning to prevent injuries. However, some Tesla workers argue the company's treatment of injured workers discourages them from reporting their injuries. If workers are assigned to \"light duty\" work because of an injury, they are paid a lower wage as well as supplemental benefits from workers' compensation insurance, a practice that Tesla said was in line with other employers and California law. \"I went from making $22 an hour to $10 an hour,\" said a production worker, who injured his back twice while working at Tesla. \"It kind of forces people to go back to work.\" \"No one wants to get a pay cut because they're injured, so everyone just forces themselves to work through it,\" added Adam Suarez, who has worked at the factory for about three years. Tesla said it was determined to further improve its safety standards. \"While some amount of injuries is inevitable, our goal at Tesla is to have as close to zero injuries as possible and to become the safest factory in the auto industry worldwide,\" the spokesperson said. Tesla Musk has a well-documented tendency to promise Mars and deliver the moon. His electric car company was, by his own admission, a gamble. Musk said starting a car manufacturer from scratch was likely \"the worst way to earn money, honestly\", though he caveated that \"maybe rockets are a bit worse\". \"On a risk adjusted return basis, an auto company has to be the dumbest thing you could possibly start.\" The company has succeeded at increasing its production rate every quarter. In the first three months of 2017, the factory produced more than 25,000 cars - a Tesla record. To meet Musk's goal for 2018, they will have to quintuple that rate. \"I think one of the major problems is that people at the top are making unrealistic quarterly goals,\" said a worker on the battery pack line. Three workers described a management tactic of assigning a monetary value to every delay on the assembly line. \"One time the robot came down and [the supervisor] came back screaming at us, 'That's $18,000, $20,0000, $30,0000, $50,000 because you guys can't get this done,'\" Gelascu recalled. Tesla argues the challenge in building vehicles from scratch with new production and manufacturing methods should not be underestimated, but that \"nothing is more important\" than protecting the health and safety of its workers. \"We're trying to do good for the world and we believe in doing the right thing,\" Musk said. \"And that extends to caring about the health and safety of everyone at the company.\" It's a more humanistic tone than the one he strikes with investors. \"You really can't have people in the production line itself. Otherwise you'll automatically drop to people speed,\" he told investors in an earnings call last year. \"There's still a lot of people at the factory, but what they're doing is maintaining the machines, upgrading them, dealing with anomalies. But in the production process itself there essentially would be no people.\" Get the latest Tesla stock price here.",

    "content": "Mercedes' at-home battery.Mercedes-BenzMercedes-Benz is taking a direct shot at Tesla's solar push and battery business. The luxury carmaker announced on Thursday it would partner with Vivint Solar to sell a smart solar ecosystem to California residents, aiming to challenge Tesla's new solar-roof rollout on its turf. As part of the partnership, Mercedes will introduce its at-home battery to the US market for the first time, while Vivint will provide solar-panel installation. The solar installer also is expected to provide a smart-home experience -- Vivint Solar announced a partnership with Vivint Smart Home at the Consumer Electronics Show in January that would allow the company to use sensors and artificial intelligence to manage energy loads automatically. The move is the latest in the solar industry's progression, started by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, of rolling battery and solar installations into one process. Rechargeable batteries are necessary for storing the electricity generated by solar panels that can be used during peak grid times. But before Tesla's acquisition of SolarCity in November, battery and solar installations were separate processes. \"We see this as an evolving appetite that consumers are asking us to bring to them,\" Vivint Solar CEO David Bywater told Business Insider. Mercedes' vision of an integrated home that includes its at-home battery and electric car.Mercedes-Benz Mercedes introduced its standing battery in Germany in April 2016, but it has since expanded to the United Kingdom and South Africa. The device, manufactured at the Mercedes subsidiary Deutsche ACCUmotive, can store 2.5 kilowatt-hours of energy but could be combined to store up to 20 kWh. The full cost, with installation, would range from under $5,000 to $13,000 for a 20 kWh system. That does compete with the price of Tesla's battery, but there's a catch. Tesla's Powerwall 2, which stores 14 kWh of energy, can cost as much as $11,450 including installation. Although it stores slightly less energy than Mercedes' full system, you would need only one Powerwall unit instead of several Mercedes batteries. Those looking to save space may opt for the Powerwall 2, which can be mounted on a wall. For reference, a US residential home used 901 kWh of electricity a month on average in 2015, according to the US Energy Information Administration. But Boris von Bormann, CEO of Mercedes' energy division, said there was plenty of room in the market for multiple players and that Mercedes has an edge when it comes to quality. Mercedes is \"not a startup. It's not a stock-value-driven company with some velocity behind it that can go one way or another,\" von Bormann said. \"It's really a mature company that will be there -- and will be there for the foreseeable future. That way, you feel trusted and have a quality brand where you get support whenever you need it.\" Tesla's Powerwall 2.TeslaTesla has taken some heat for its stock valuation that has matched the levels of Ford and General Motors despite selling a fraction of the vehicles. Tesla is looking to improve solar adoption by offering more aesthetically appealing solar shingles, which the company began selling this month. Both Tesla and Mercedes see at-home batteries as an extension of their electric-car plans. Musk made that much clear at his initial solar-roof unveiling, where he discussed how a solar push would allow for the full integration of Tesla products: a Powerwall that both stores solar energy and juices up your Tesla electric car. \"We're not just looking at energy storage as a pure storage play, but looking strongly at it from an electric-vehicle perspective, as well with the expansion of Daimler into EVs,\" von Bormann said. For now, Mercedes will leverage its partnership with Vivint to roll out its battery in California, but it could expand to other states based on consumer interest. Mercedes says it is also interested in exploring markets like China and Australia. Get the latest Tesla stock price here.",

    "content": "Adam Berry/Getty Images Facebook wants to grab a big chunk of the $70 billion-plus US TV ad market. The opportunity is clear. Even as the social network's advertising business has exploded, driven by small and mid-sized companies, major brand advertisers -- that is companies that sell soda and cereal and razor blades and beer -- have historically spent the largest portions of their budgets on TV ads. Break in to TV advertising, and billions of dollars could flow to Facebook. The challenge for the tech giant is breaking old habits and fending off resistance from suspicious media companies. Despite the ongoing decline in live TV viewing, large swaths of marketers' budgets have remained stubbornly locked up in TV advertising. And for the most part, TV advertising is controlled by TV companies. That leaves tech platforms like Facebook with a few options if they want to jam their way into the TV ad world. They can: It's the latter route that Facebook has chosen. The company aspires to help TV companies sell ads using their sophisticated digital ad tech and robust data. The focus is on ads that are delivered when people watch content on their TVs via apps, ranging from individual TV networks apps to services that aggregate content from multiple networks. People in the TV business refer to this as \"OTT\" or \"over the top\" viewing, where consumers get their TV via a device like a Roku or Chromecast, rather than through a set-top cable box. Facebook is facing some resistance, however, and its OTT ad play is a work in progress. Meanwhile, rivals such as Amazon, Google and Hulu, a joint venture between Walt Disney Co., 21st Century Fox, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Time Warner, will be well positioned to experiment with more sophisticated TV ad tactics later this year. The stakes are high. The faster that one of these tech companies can establish that it is the one that can bring innovation to TV advertising, the more TV partners it is likely to land and more advertisers it will be able to work with. An early foothold will theoretically make it a lot harder for other tech to gain real traction in the TV ad ecosystem. Last November, Recode reported that Facebook had kicked off a small test with a handful of partners, including Roku, A+E Networks and the startup Tubi TV. Ad buyers say that while those test have continued, the amount of ad inventory available remains limited, and Facebook has moved at a deliberate pace. Facebook has focused on \"OTT ads,\" or ads that appear as people stream TV on apps via connected TVs using devices like Rokus or Apple TVs. While a huge chunk of viewing on web-connected TVs is driven by non-ad supported content (Netflix, Amazon, HBO, etc.), the ad tech company Videology recently issued a report that found the number of ad campaigns including some amount of OTT ad inventory' jumped sixfold over the past two years. For example, last summer NBCU saw big increases in people streaming the Olympics via connected TVs. But i t's not clear just how aggressive Facebook is actually being when it comes to trying to land more TV partners for this initiative. \"It's been more noise than action,\" said an ad buyer. \"There is no real Facebook TV right now.\" Apple Several major TV companies said they've yet to even hear from Facebook about this program, for example. One ad industry insider said that Facebook appears to have hit a wall when it comes to getting more big media companies to sign on. That's because many traditional media firms view Facebook with suspicion, given its dominance in digital advertising, where some see monopolistic practices. And in general, TV ad companies, despite cord-cutting and declining ratings, don't typically have trouble selling ads in their top shows and don't like the idea of a third party selling their ad space. \"We'll never let them sell our stuff,\" said one top TV ad sales exec. Traditionally, TV networks have sold ads during live breaks, and these ads reach the entire country at once. But theoretically, as more people stream TV using apps or cable-alternative services like DirecTV Now, advertisers can show different ads to different people, much like they do on websites. The idea with this test is that Facebook could sell TV ad space to a wider swath of advertisers, and potentially individual viewers could receive more targeted ads. For example, Facebook could show different ads to men and women watching the same TV content within a network's app, or show specific ads to groups like people likely to be in the market for a new car. Given what Facebook knows about its users' characteristics and interests, it should theoretically be pretty good at this sort of thing. \"Of all the digital platforms, they do the best to use their data for relevant advertising,\" said Tracey Scheppach, a veteran ad buyer who is now CEO of the consultancy Matter More Media. But Scheppach also gets why TV networks are resistant. \"It's a recipe for that behemoth to control too much data.\" So far, Facebook's OTT ad rollout seems to be slow going. Yet Facebook is hiring more people for the initiative and wants to demonstrate the potential of the medium early on before rolling it out more widely, according to someone familiar with the matter. \"Our initial testing started six months ago,\" said a Facebook spokesperson. \" It's still very early. Scale will come soon enough.\" Amazon, Google and Hulu are positioned to race ahead, in contrast. Fox Sports Amazon will be free to experiment with more digital-like ads during live NFL games this year. The same can be said for Google, as its fledgling YouTube TV streaming services reaches more market. In both cases, those companies control roughly two minutes of commercial time per hour. Hulu has long employed more web-like targeting when it delivers ads to people using its on-demand service. Going forward, as Hulu signs up people for its $40 per month 50-channel service, it will be able to play around with more digital ad tactics. Theoretically, these companies could leap ahead of Facebook as more web-like TV ad targeting evolves. Of course, Facebook is known for biding it's time and then going big on an initiative. Some inside the social network have likened this to when the company planned its push into mobile a few years ago before quickly becoming a dominant mobile player. There's a big difference of course between mobile, where Facebook controlled its own product, and TV, where it does not. TV is fundamentally a different business, one that can be unwelcoming to outsiders. \" I think it's gonna be hard,\" said one ad tech executive. \" People are scared of Facebook.\"",

    "content": "Crowdstrike founder CEO George Kurtz Crowdstrike Crowdstrike, the security startup best known for discovering that Russians were behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee, has raised yet another $100 million. The six-year-old company has now raised $256 million and is valued at just under $1 billion, the New York Times reports. This $100 million was led by Accel. Crowdstrike had also raised $100 million back in 2015 led by CapitalG (formerly Google Capital) that valued the company at $667 million. The investment in Crowdstrike comes at an interesting time. Security breaches are continuously making headlines and one of Crowdstrike's biggest competitors, Tanium, was the subject of much bad press last month. Tanium raised $287 million of venture investment at a valuation of $3.7 billion, making it one of the most highly valued security startups in tech these days. But its CEO was accused of firing employees right before their stock vested (a charge he denied) and the company was then accused of inappropriately exposing a hospital's network by doing live demos (a situation the company sort of admitted to). Missteps by one competitor is an opportunity for another. And VCs are flush with cash right now, looking to pour more money into strong companies, although perhaps not at the super sweet terms they were offering back in 2015. Crowdstrike has not been without its controversies, too. In February, the company tried, and failed, to get a temporary restraining order and injunction to stop a software testing lab, known as NSS Labs, from publishing results of a test that pitted CrowdStrike's software against several competitors. The company says it's growing quickly, and that's the thing that's music to a VC's ears. Although CrowdStrike has not released revenue numbers, it says it counts 10% of the Fortune 1000 as customers and has seen big growth in the number of deals valued at $1 million or more per year.",

In the last two weeks, Google's artificial intelligence (AI) lab has hired ex-Snapchat PR Ruth Barnett and former BBC News tech editor Jon Fildes, meaning that DeepMind now has around five full-time media relations staff. London-based DeepMind relied on Google's army of PR employees up until last October when it started building out its own team. The unit is headed up by Ollie Rickman, who worked in comms at Google for several years before leaving to cofound Milltown Partners, where he advised US tech companies, European startups, and venture capitalists. The latest PR appointments at DeepMind, which is developing algorithms that can learn and think for themselves, come as the company faces increasing scrutiny from regulators and the media. Of particular note is a controversial data-sharing deal that gave DeepMind access to 1.6 million NHS medical records without patients being informed. This week, it emerged that Dame Fiona Caldicott, the National Data Guardian and the most senior data protection adviser to the NHS, concluded that the deal was legally inappropriate. The Information Commissioner's Office, the UK's main data watchdog, is carrying out its own investigation into whether the deal was legal under the Data Protection Act and a verdict is expected to be made public in the coming weeks. However, Business Insider understands that Barnett and Fildes were not hired to work on the DeepMind Health side of the business. DeepMind enjoyed a lot of positive publicity after it developed an algorithm that successfully defeated the world champion of Chinese board game Go -- an incredibly difficult game for machines to master due to the sheer number of potential moves. The research company, which has published over 100 papers and is widely regarded as a British success story, has also made headlines for helping Google to save vast amounts of energy in its power-hungry data centres. DeepMind currently employs around 400 staff in King's Cross and a small team in Mountain View but The Economist reported last Decenber that the company could soon be expanded to around 1,000 people.

    "content": "TransferWise CEO Taavet Hinrikus. Jan Haas/DPA/PA Images LONDON -- Online money transfer business TransferWise says it is on track for revenues of PS100 million ($128.97 million) this year and is profitable on an operational basis. In a business update on Wednesday, the closely-watched startup said it is currently doing PS8 million a month in revenue and should hit PS100 million in total this year. Revenues grew by 150% last year, the company said. That would suggest revenues of close to PS69 million in the year to March 2017, as TransferWise had a turnover of PS27.8 million in the year to March 2016. Founded in 2011, London-headquartered TransferWise lets people send money overseas online. It has built its brand around being cheap and easy, leaving banks playing catch up. The company moves over PS1 billion across its platform each month and has over 1 million customers. TransferWise says it expects to add another 1 million customers this year. CEO and cofounder Taavet Hinrikus says in an emailed statement: \"We're building one of the few new global financial services brands that are coming out now. It's hard to build a 10x better product, go to market and build your own brand; that's why you see a lot of co-operation between banks and fintechs. \"To have hit break-even just six years on from launch shows how strong the foundations of our business are. This is just the starting point. With the unique platform we've built, we're looking forward to creating a new kind of financial services for the future.\" TransferWise is one of London's few \"unicorns\" -- private tech companies worth over $1 billion. The business was reportedly valued at $1.1 billion in a $26 million funding round last May. TransferWise currently employs 700 people in 9 offices around the world, recently launching an Asian hub in Singapore. The company says it has a 10% share of the international money transfer market in the UK and lets customers send money on over 750 routes. The business update comes amid increasing competition in the online money transfer market. London foreign exchange startup Revolut recently announced it would offer free international transfers of up to PS5,000 a month, saying in a press release that the offer is \"to challenge TransferWise.\" (The move raised eyebrows in the tech community given that both companies share an investor -- Index Ventures.)",

    "content": "The Bragi Dash Pro. Jeff Dunn/Business Insider Headphones are increasingly trying to be more than just mini speakers. No, your everyday earbuds aren't going anywhere. But for the past couple of years, a small subset of companies have quietly tried to turn some wireless headphones from simple audio products to full-fledged in-ear computers. German startup Bragi has been a key part of this; its Dash earbuds blew up on Kickstarter in 2014, and helped shape what a so-called \"hearable\" could be. The gadgets had touch controls, fitness tracking tools, the ability to let in outside noise, and heaps of sensors. They also played music! The problem is they weren't very good. Bragi improved the Dash with software updates over time, but their battery life was eternally short, and they just couldn't stay connected over Bluetooth. The fact that they cost $300 didn't help. Bragi Months have passed, though, and the ideas Bragi was getting at make a little more sense today. Apple's AirPods have made the concept of truly wireless earbuds somewhat normal, companies that make such devices have generally figured out how to keep them connected, and startups like Doppler Labs have furthered the notion of earbuds that augment real-world sound. Now, Bragi is launching its follow-up: the Dash Pro. It goes for $329, and it's available online today. Bragi says a retail launch at Best Buy and other stores will happen \"over the coming weeks.\" The Dash Pro largely follows in the original Dash's footsteps: It looks almost identical; it's totally wireless; it still fits snugly (after a little maneuvering); it does fitness tracking; it has a host of touch, swipe, and motion controls to learn; and there's 4 GB of built-in storage, so you can play audio files straight from the device. The existing Dash will be discontinued to make way for the Dash Pro, but many of the upgrades here are coming from a big software update that will also apply to the older model. Bragi is promising better battery life, improved sound, a cleaner \"audio transparency\" mode (i.e., the mode that allows you to let in more real-world sound without taking the earbuds off), and a \"one-touch\" Bluetooth pairing process. All of that sounds great, but I won't be able to say how true it actually is before testing the Dash Pro further. You can have your name engraved on the custom version of the Dash Pro. Bragi The thing Bragi is pushing the hardest is a partnership with iTranslate, a foreign language translation app. Some background: Doppler Labs and other \"hearable\" companies have long been teasing the possibility of having your smart earbuds translate foreign languages in real time. The dream is that you can hear someone talk to you in English (or whatever) in real-time even as they're speaking in Mandarin in reality. Bragi's OS update will technically make that happen, but it's a bit of a hacky workaround. You need a $5 monthly subscription to iTranslate Pro and to have that app loaded on your phone. When your foreign-tongued friend begins speaking, the phone app translates his words in real time and pipes an English version straight into your earbuds. On the off chance that you come across another Bragi Dash Pro user, you can just talk to each other with the app connected, nodding each time you speak. It's nice that Bragi has something for this scenario -- and Bragi says the app supports about 40 languages -- but you could use iTranslate on your phone and be nearly as efficient, without the head nods. Along those lines is something Bragi calls the \"Virtual 4D Menu.\" This taps into the motion controls Business Insider reported on last year; as you move your head to the sides, the Dash or Dash Pro will tell you menu commands, as if you were looking at a virtual screen. Move it slightly to the right, and you can select, say, Google Assistant (or Siri on iOS); move it far to the left, and you can choose to pause a song that's playing. If this works, great, but simply using your voice to activate certain commands would seem to render the head movement part moot. Bragi Slightly more useful is the update's purported ability to automatically recognize whether you're running, swimming, or biking, then log your exercise data in Bragi's companion app accordingly. Likewise, Bragi says it's rolling out a \"superhearing\" mode that lets you raise or lower the volume of the outside world. The most significant updates are still likely to be the simplest. Bragi says the Dash Pro gets five hours of battery life on a charge, or 30 hours through its battery case; that's not amazing in a vacuum, but it would be toward the longest-lasting for a truly wireless earphone if it holds up. The whole thing is waterproof, too, and Bragi claims its bumped up the voice tech so you won't have to repeat your commands too often. Bragi is also promising that the Dash Pro's Bluetooth connection will be as reliable as its lower-end Headphone earbuds. I found those to work very well, but they also have far less tech to deal with. Again, time will tell. Given that my brief demo was in a noisy restaurant, the same sentiment applies to the Dash Pro's sound quality. If you're super into all of this, Bragi is also partnering with hearing aid maker Starkey on a model that can be customized to the shape of your ears. It'll cost $500, and you'll have to visit an audiologist to get yourself fitted, but if you're willing to splurge on a fit that only you can wear, there you go. Bragi Earphones like the Dash Pro live and die by their smarter features. If you just want truly wireless earbuds, the Headphone is very competent (potentially awkward fit aside), and the AirPods work like a dream with other Apple devices. They're both much less expensive, too. Bragi certainly has big ideas for devices like this -- CEO Nikolaj Hviid said the company has toyed with the idea of using earbuds like this to power AR-style glasses. He's prone to waxing poetic about the ways his \"ear computers\" could devour data to make your life easier. Plus, the Dash Pro may have its charms -- having your headphones double as your fitness tracker makes sense, and being able to do phone things without having to stare at a screen is a compelling pitch. \"If I want to go to a specific restaurant, I don't need to take my phone out, and walk down the street like this,\" Hviid said, pantomiming a phone an inch from his face, with a tone of disgust in his voice. \"That's ridiculous.\" The underlying tech has to work first, though. Here's hoping that Bragi's promises hold true this time around. If they do, then we can talk about how healthy the notion of keeping computers in your ears all day is for society. We'll have a more definitive verdict on the Dash Pro in the coming weeks, after we give it a full hands-on review.",

    "content": "Microsoft Corporate VP Jeff TeperMicrosoftWhen Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella first took the reins of the company in 2014, one of the first things he did was issue a new edict for the company: \"cloud first, mobile first.\" It took two years for SharePoint, the company's team collaboration tool, to get with the new program. But now, SharePoint is actually a leader in Microsoft's \"cloud first\" effort. More than 60% of all SharePoint customers use the version that's included with Microsoft's Office 365 cloud-based office suite. And SharePoint is now the second-most used product in that suite, trailing only the Exchange Online email service. \"SharePoint is very much a hero app with a vibrant community,\" says Microsoft Corporate VP of SharePoint Jeff Teper. SharePoint is the kind of multi-purpose enterprise product that startups like Dropbox and Slack love to pick on, but it's a huge product for Microsoft, generating more than $3 billion a year in revenues for the company in 2015, the last numbers the company's disclosed. It acts as a central repository of documents, data, and information for employees, and lots of developers use it as the launching point for their own products. It became fully in sync with Nadella's vision with the launch of its mobile app in May 2016 The Office 365 suite of which SharePoint is a part is an important part of Nadella's strategy. Microsoft needs to show Wall Street and the world that the cloud versions of its products are selling as well or better than the traditional software they're quickly replacing. SharePoint's success in the cloud has given Nadella a way to show his strategy is working. Nadella has some new catch phrases for Microsoft to focus on: Now it's all about the \"intelligent cloud\" and the \"intelligent edge.\" His vision is that, using a system called the Microsoft Graph, customers' data will be stored in the cloud and available on any of their devices, no matter what those devices happen to be. SharePoint will play a big role in this effort. The cloud version will have a new, personalized search function that will track the documents you use in every Office app and on all your devices. If you're at a Fortune 500 company, and you have thousands or hundreds of thousands of documents to sift through, the new feature will makes it easier for you to find just what you're looking for. Microsoft SharePoint for iPhone, alongside the SharePoint home page.Microsoft \"It's the biggest leap of the SharePoint user experience in the history of the platform,\" Teper says. For SharePoint, it's a weird sort of homecoming. Teper says his team actually created the Microsoft Graph years ago. The SharePoint team created an app called Delve, that allows customers to see a newsfeed of the documents and files their coworkers are using. The app, which Teper says was a way to \"incubate\" the Graph, became one of Nadella's favorite ways to manage the company. \"Now, it's a cross-company thing,\" says Teper. The SharePoint team has worked closely with the rest of the company -- not just with the Office 365 group, but also with the Azure cloud computing platform, Teper says. Its service works well with all of Microsoft's products, he adds. Those are signals that times are changing at the tech giant, he says. \"Microsoft is really coming together under Satya's leadership,\" Teper says. Microsoft CEO Satya NadellaThomson Reuters Going forward, SharePoint's biggest challenge doesn't come from competitors, he says. While SharePoint has rivals that \"push us forward,\" the hardest task for the product's managers is convincing the hold-outs among its customers to use the cloud version of its service. Microsoft aims to lure them in by talking about how Office 365 will allow to receive upgrades and new features, like personalized search, while also relieving them of the need to manage their own servers, he says. \"The biggest opportunity is to move all of our customers to the cloud,\" Teper says.

His exit followed a tumultuous period of infighting among the trio and Dorsey's ouster as CEO. Fast forward to 2017: Dorsey has been back in Twitter's CEO seat for two years. Stone recently sold the human-powered search engine Jelly, his latest startup, to Pinterest for an undisclosed sum.

    "content": "Shawn Mendes Getty / Rich Polk / Stringer For a rising pop star, the money side of the music business has drastically changed in the last few years, according to Andrew Gertler, who manages teen singer-songwriter sensation Shawn Mendes and runs AG Artists. \"The music really is not as much the revenue generator as the marketing tool to then create other income streams,\" Gertler told Business Insider, speaking by phone from Mendes' worldwide arena tour. Those other income streams include not only things like live events and brand deals, but also opportunities at the crossroads of music and TV (or video in general), where Gertler said the line is getting more and more blurred. Though Mendes has already cracked the top 10 on Billboard's Hot 100 multiple times, Gertler looks at his career as a growth-stage business. \"For the artists' fans and for artists, in terms of exposure, music should be everywhere and as easily accessible as humanly possible ... especially for an artist you are still building,\" Gertler said. Mendes is on an upward trajectory, and hasn't yet reached mega-stardom, Gertler explained. The idea is this: \"Let's get him in front of as many people as possible.\" That style of thinking sounds strikingly similar to tech startups, where the initial focus is often on grabbing as many users as possible, before turning toward better monetization later on. And as far as making money from the actual music, Gertler has also seen a shift. He used to see about 75% of that revenue from sales on iTunes, with 25% coming from streaming services like Spotify. Now it's more like 65-70% streaming, and 30% iTunes. \"It's been a complete flip in only a few years,\" Gertler said. Andrew Gertler (left) and Shawn Mendes (right) Andrew Gertler Besides revenue, the other biggest change for up-and-coming music stars is the amount of access fans want to their private lives. \"Fans and the general public are so used to unlimited access,\" Gertler said. So is there any line? \"There really isn't one,\" according to Gertler. Fans \"probably know [pop stars] better than anyone should know someone.\" This also means that it is extremely difficult for a pop star to have continued success without a sense of authenticity. It's not like the past, where there were flashing lights and spectacle, and you didn't really know what the artist was like in day-to-day life. Now you see what an artist is doing when they wake up, Gertler said. Artists that succeed in this model are those who can make a one-to-many relationship feel like a one-to-one relationship. \"How do you make it feel like they really know you,\" Gertler said. That necessity for a sense of authenticity can also make brand deals tricky. It used to be you could do an exclusive clothing deal, and no one saw you every single day, Gertler explained. Now people see stars at all times on social media, and you have to be a bit more careful. It's more of a commitment. For a manager, this new world requires much more \"hand-to-hand combat,\" according to Gertler. He's traveling all over the place with Mendes, and a lot of young managers doing the same, he said, citing Pat Corcoran who manages Chance the Rapper. You have to be at the center of the universe of that artist to understand what is going on at all times -- and what the fans want. It is an ongoing dialogue with fans that happens in real-time. If you aren't at the center of it, you could get out of step.",

    "content": "BMW BMW is expanding its network of enviable partners to take on Mercedes and Tesla in the race to develop self-driving cars. The Munich-based automaker added Delphi to the list of partners aiding its effort to develop an autonomous driving platform by 2021 that can be sold to other automakers. Delphi, an automotive parts supplier spun out of General Motors in 2011, will join Intel and Mobileye in the consortium. All four parties declined to elaborate on the financial relationship between them and how that will play out when they begin licensing the platform at the start of the next decade during a press call with journalists Tuesday. Delphi's partnership with BMW, Intel, and Mobileye is non-exclusive. The move further positions BMW to take on Mercedes and Tesla in both self-driving-car development and the collection of vehicle data. Delphi has snatched up several startups, like Movimento, so it can release a suite of software products that would allow automakers to make over-the-air updates, a strategy pioneered by Tesla, Bloomberg reported in April. Delphi has also invested in Israeli startup Otonomo, which is helping Mercedes' parent company Daimler and 8 other major automakers, sell car data to third parties. The race to capitalize on the big data is growing fiercer. New vehicles on the road today are already collecting data by virtue of connected car platforms, but the addition of smart sensors to aid autonomous driving will only grow data sets. McKinsey & Co. predicts car data could become a $750 billion industry by 2030. BMW's alignment with Delphi will help position the automaker to compete more directly with Mercedes, which already uses Otonomo's services. The German carmaker can also leverage its relationship with Intel, which invested $250 million in the development of self-driving vehicles and big data in November. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich went so far as to call data \"the next oil\" when he made the investment last year. There's a lot moving parts in a consortium of this size, but Delphi CTO Glen De Vos said the normal tiered structure between suppliers and automakers is becoming less applicable as companies compete on developing a digital ecosystem. Richard Rau, BMW's vice president of sensors, said he believes these kinds of consolidations will occur more frequently over time. Ultimately, there will be a \"fairly small\" number of autonomous driving platforms shaping the market. \"In the long run there will on be a few platforms left,\" he said.

    "content": "Jose Llorens.Jose LlorensJose Llorens worked at Google for over three years, eventually becoming creative lead at \"The Zoo\" -- Google's creative think tank for brands and agencies. Llorens chose to leave Google in 2016 to write a novel. Here's why: Last year I took the biggest decision of my career and left behind a life of comfort to venture into the unknown. I worked at Google's creative think-tank, known as The Zoo, where my job consisted of playing with the latest technologies and finding creative ways of using them. From creating experiences in virtual reality, to interactive 360 videos or augmented reality coloring books, there was no limit to our imagination. Our working area was more like a playground than an office and we had access to every resource we needed to generate new ideas. If someone had told me when I was a student that I would have ended up there I wouldn't have believed it. Quite often, I'd get contacted by people asking me how did I get the job and how could they join my team too, which reminded me how lucky I was. However, a few reasons led me to leave it all behind and embark in a new challenge: Writing a novel. In the age of globalism and connectivity it's easy to be overwhelmed. We have in front of us the broadest range of choices to ever be available to humans, which means we need to make more decisions. There are so many roads to choose that we keep asking ourselves if the one we are walking is the best one. Is this the right career path? What about changing countries again? Is this my true vocation? These were the common doubts that kept me awake at night. I envy my father on this, he's an airline captain who knew since he was six years old that he wanted to fly airplanes, and now that he's close to retiring he still enjoys every flight. I wish I had that, but there isn't one single job that will give me that boost. I have worn many hats already: Photographer, editor, art director, teacher, entrepreneur, freelancer, account manager, construction worker, public relations, creative director, barman, and extra in \"Game of Thrones.\" I enjoyed them all but I wouldn't do only one of those for the rest of my life and I've realised that maybe I want to do everything. I won't be an expert on one thing but know a bit about many things. Therefore, learning to become a writer seemed like an interesting new thing to do. Working at Google was challenging, don't get me wrong. You are surrounded by some of the smartest people around and overachievers that keep you in a constant state of stimulation. I had to sell ideas to big audiences, deal with C-level executives and come up with constant innovation. However, since it's a huge company, if at the end of the presentation the client didn't buy the idea, you still get paid. Things can go wrong but you will get your salary and free meals, which is a good thing if you seek for stability, but misses the emotional rollercoaster of the entrepreneurs and self-workers, where your pay is strictly related to the outcome of your work. I had a good job and a network within tech and advertising, so I could have stopped pressing the gas pedal and relaxed to enjoy the ride, but my mind wouldn't let me rest. The idea of jumping into a new industry in which I had no contacts or knowledge seemed exciting enough just for the challenge of trying to succeed in a new discipline. Sometimes the brain is a sucker for drama. This is the dark side of advertising that we don't want to think about so I'll say it clearly: Advertising fosters consumerism and there's no way around it. Even though our focus as creatives is to create beautiful and engaging content, the underlying goal most of the time is to increase sales. Sometimes you can do great work, and I got the chance to help NGOs that are fighting Alzheimer's, cancer, and climate change, as well as produce work for companies and startups in whose products I believed in. But many others, you have to work for brands that might not be that appealing to you and advertise products that you don't feel are that necessary to the world, because they pay too. In a time when we hear news every day about global warming, pollution, scarcity of resources, mass extinction of species and an increasing gap between the richest and the poorest, it's hard not to realise that you are a part of the problem when you're putting your efforts on stimulating consumerism and increasing sales. As small as my contribution was, I was a soldier in that war and couldn't help to feel guilty for it. I'm turning 30 this year, which means I'm still young enough to make mistakes and fail, so I had to take the chance. In a few years I hope to be married and have kids, and in such a scenario I can't see myself going bankrupt or not bringing home an income for a long time, because my kids will be dependent on me and my partner, and I wouldn't gamble with their future. Now I'm free in that sense. I can live anywhere in the world, be rich, be poor, it doesn't matter as long as no one relies on my income, so this is the time to risk and win big, fail, or maybe just something in between and sell a few books. I remember when I quit my job that some of my older colleagues felt happy for me, but at the same time jealous that they couldn't do the same because they had families. They'd rather be great parents and ensure a stable future to their kids than follow their crazy dreams, which I completely understand. It was now or wait until I retired. Last but not least, I've had this story in my mind for the last five years. The more I travelled and the more people I met, the more the narrative took shape in my mind, up the point that I had to take the time to spill it out on the pages. I have lived and worked in seven countries, and in every one of them, from Mexico to Berlin, I found a common trait amongst my generation which is the will to adhere meaning to our lives. It's no longer enough with just having a job, we want to change the world for the better and have a positive impact. We want to be successful whilst having time to enjoy life at its fullest, and this is why we struggle so much when managing our most precious resource, time. Hence the title for the novel, \"Time on Earth.\" You can find it here, and if you read it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it. It has been a cathartic experience, locking myself up for ten months, alone with my mind until I found the sequence of 94.717 words that tell the exact story I wanted to tell.

    "content": "Symphony CEO David Gurle. Symphony Symphony, the secure chat app backed by some of Wall Street's biggest banks, has raised $63 million (PS48.8 million). Palo Alto-based Symphony announced on Tuesday that it has raised the sum from French bank BNP Paribas and its existing shareholders, which include Goldman Sachs and Google. Olivier Osty, BNP Paribas' executive head of global markets, says: \"Digital transformation is central to BNP Paribas Global Markets' strategy, and collaboration with fintechs is a crucial part of that process.\" BNP announced in February plans to double investment in technology to EUR3 billion (PS2.5 billion, $3.2 billion) over the next three years as part of plans to adapt to changing consumer behaviour and cut costs. Osty says: \"Forming agile partnerships with exciting and innovative companies like Symphony helps us deliver an exceptional service to clients, and remain their partner of choice in a changing world.\" Symphony is a like Slack for banks. It allows bankers and other people working in highly regulated environments to benefit from enterprise encryption and security while they chat online, either through text or voice. The platform has evolved, and third-party apps can be installed to show financial data, monitor sentiment on Twitter, and perform tasks such as charting. Partners include Dow Jones and IHS Markit. David Gurle, Symphony's founder and CEO, says in a statement announcing the new investment: \"This financing is a recognition of the value our customers have experienced as the Symphony community has grown. \"Our customers' desire to make Symphony their central platform and replace legacy tools is an endorsement of the efficiencies brought by an integrated collaboration platform and streamlined workflow.\" Symphony will use the fresh funding to \"accelerate expansion, to drive growth in both its current and new markets, and further build out its feature stack to deliver a new wave of innovation to enterprises and replace traditional collaboration tools.\" Symphony has been spearheaded by some of Wall Streets biggest banks. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley bought chat app Perzo in October 2014 and invested over $60 million (PS46.5 million) into it to relaunch it as a financial chat app. Tuesday's funding injection means it has raised over $200 million (PS155.1 million). Google came on as an investor in 2015. The investment from Wall Street banks back in 2014 was seen as a conscious effort to move away from reliance on Bloomberg terminals after a scandal in 2013 when it emerged that Bloomberg journalists could see what clients were reading on their terminals. Gurle has played down the rivalry with Bloomberg, telling Business Insider Symphony's goal is to replace workplace email, not Bloomberg. However, Bloomberg appears to see Symphony as a threat and has sought to lobby against the rival product in Europe. Symphony has over 200,000 paying users, up from 116,000 last October.

The startup is a catalyst for the nascent virtual reality and augmented reality industries, providing everything from online skills classes to incubating startups, as well as operating an eponymous industry news site, UploadVR. Its cofounders, editor-in-chief Will Mason and CEO Taylor Freeman, were named in January to the \"Forbes 30 under 30\" media list for their work to draw more people into the emerging industry. Yet inside the company, the plaintiff claims that UploadVR was a \"boy's club\" that didn't welcome anyone else into the fold. She worked as the company's director of digital and social media from May 2016 until she was let go in March for what she claims was retaliation for complaining to her boss about the office environment. Among the litany of accusations in her complaint, the former employee alleges that: Upload VR's founders Freeman and Mason told Business Insider in an emailed statement that the allegations are \"entirely without merit\" but cannot comment directly on pending litigation. \"What we want to express is that our employees are our greatest asset and the sole reason for the success of this company,\" the founders said in a statement. \"We are committed to creating a positive community in VR/AR as well as within our company culture and will work to further develop that mission in the future.

Let us tell the world your success story.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Started >> Entrepreneurs have multiple sources of funding when they seek their first outside capital: friends and family, professional angels, venture capital (VC) funds and crowdfunding platforms. One type of funding, which is sometimes overlooked and which can be quite powerful, is corporate venture funds. Corporate venture funds come in different shapes and sizes, but typically, they are funds affiliated with large companies that are interested in tapping into innovation taking place within particular industries. Loosely referred to as \"strategic\" investors, they represent a fast-growing segment of the funding market. According to CB Insights, there are nearly 200 active corporate VC funds. In 2015, they invested about $18 billion across 850 companies in the United States alone. Notable funders include Google/GV, Comcast Ventures, Bloomberg, Intel Capital and Salesforce Ventures. Given the size and scope of these funds (and despite some industry misconceptions), corporate VCs present a strong option for entrepreneurs looking to get the most value from their investors. So, what are several of the unique advantages that they offer?  Related: <!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->How to Start a Business With (Almost) No Money Corporate VC funds can provide access to established customers and accelerate a startup's ability to find its product/market fit. Most companies creating these funds tend to have large installed customer bases and can identify early adopters for new technology. Gaining this type of entry can be difficult for an unknown startup still trying to build its credibility. The value of nailing down product/market fit cannot be understated as it sets the stage for acquiring a company's first set of paying customers.  Once market validation is achieved, developing a commercial agreement can generate much-needed revenue in the early days of a startup. This should be set up as a stand-alone agreement -- not tied to the investment agreement -- that provides market value to both sides. By securing paying customers, you can lessen the requirements for outside capital and, at the same time, demonstrate a sustainable business model.  Related: <!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->22 Qualities That Make a Great Leader Since large companies have a history of being in business, they possess institutional knowledge that can help startups think about issues related to their target market. Daily interactions with customers produce insights that may have implications to a startup's product or marketing strategy. Furthermore, a startup can improve its visibility in a competitive landscape.  Securing an investment from one strategic investor can encourage others to do the same, because if a strategic partner understands the market and the problem and it's willing to put money into a company, then there must be value there. Plus, many corporate investors, whether they are investing from the parent company's balance sheet or a dedicated fund, will invest in multiple rounds. This renewed commitment is a positive market signal and can ease the burden of additional fundraising.

Over time, as a relationship develops, dependencies can occur that spur an acquirer to want to own the assets, for offensive or defensive reasons. Diligence for these types of deals is a bit easier as the acquirer is already familiar with the company's business and executive team, which makes things move along more quickly.

It's these moments that marketers must capitalize on because  many of these moments are I-want-to-know, I-want-to-buy, I-want-to-go or I-want-to-do moments, where you can engage with prospective customers in a one-on-one transaction. A customer journey map is one of the most powerful methods of identifying and understanding the needs of your customers. By mapping out each and every step of interaction between a customer and your digital product, you can ensure that your offering always meets or exceeds their needs and desires. Gamification can inspire renewed energy and motivation in the office. Gamification is a scientific, technology-driven process that motivates employees via point scoring such as a game, thus creating a personal challenge. The method of gamification involves badges, leader boards and points that can be used for rewards, achievement and recognition.

Let us tell the world your success story.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Started >> The stratospheric rise of technological growth has created an interesting problem for enterprise companies' R&D departments -- there are just too many directions to grow in. Enterprises just don't have the resources to provide R&D across the spectrum of their needs, leading to two options: stagnation or the delegation of modernization. With early stage startups and small businesses disrupting traditional industries at an ever-increasing scale, larger and less agile companies are finding it more difficult to stay ahead of the curve and avoid losing market share to the new encroaching companies. Related: 11 Startups Taking Advantage of Business Opportunities in Space The world of finance has traditionally been seen as a behemoth -- slow to change but powerful, impenetrable and often elitist -- but in a press release earlier this month, PwC announced that it forecasts traditional global financial firms could stand to lose almost one-quarter of their revenue to standalone fintech companies in three to five years. Eighty-eight percent of financial services companies that were surveyed saw their new competition as a real threat, but rather than attempting to squeeze the newer fintech companies out of the market, these giants are embracing the challenge. By understanding and providing for the needs of the smaller companies (access to customers, data and funding), larger institutions are implementing the new technological solutions and maintaining their leading edge. This has led some smart global giants to rethink their innovation strategy, and shift the responsibility of companywide modernization from one single, internally facing department to each sector of the business exploring options for how they can stay on top of their game. This could come in the form of new workflows or changing internal processes, but increasingly, small companies are becoming the driving force behind innovation, with small, nimble startups providing products or services to larger enterprises, and being the differentiating factor central to their business success. Related: 4 Tips for Success From One of Silicon Beach's Most Creative Companies For these collaborations to work, there are numerous hurdles to overcome. Small- and medium-sized businesses can often find it difficult to connect with enterprises -- getting in front of the most relevant person, pitching and winning a tender can take years, meanwhile the enterprise is being prospected with hundreds or companies, with only a handful being relevant to their current needs. Once this prospecting process is complete, and the enterprise selects a startup to work with, a \"proof-of-concept\" (PoC) period is started, which leads to its own challenges on both ends. Startups need to adapt to scale their offering while larger companies have to contend with the new risks of data breaches and contingency planning if the PoC fails. One company has sprung up to help contend with this growing challenge over the last few years. Israel-based prooV bridges the gap between startups and enterprises by operating as a service platform. Speaking with the CEO, Toby Olshanetsky, he explained, \"Enterprises are finding themselves in a situation where their industries are being disrupted by more innovative startups than themselves. They're realizing how crucial it is to keep up with the smaller guys to stay ahead because if they don't, they'll quickly fall behind. Simply put: Innovate or die. So many enterprises are looking to collaborate with smaller startups, because they have the solutions to fill the enterprises innovation needs.\" Related: How to Avoid Getting Fooled by Trends Using a platform like prooV, enterprises are able to \"taste\" many different startups' technologies at once, running limited and secure trials on their own systems before deciding to purchase the software, or even acquire the company as a whole. This idea of \"PoC as a service\" has gained credence, with clients including General Electric and Amazon Web Services. Whereas in recent years, industry incumbents viewed growing small businesses and startups as competition to be quashed, the mindset is quickly shifting to embrace these new companies as an opportunity to evolve, grow and fill in the gaps from their own R&D departments.

    "content": "Phishing (i.e., fake, malicious email) doesn't always get a lot of respect. At a time when the world is focused on \"zero days,\" cyber \"weapons\" and \"kinetic\" cyber attacks on the power grid, the very concept of phishing emails seems decidedly old-fashioned, almost second-rate. In reality, however, phishing continues to pose one of the top threats to businesses and consumers the world over. And it's about to get even worse. Related: 4 Ways Ransomware Companies Behave Like Legitimate Businesses On May 3, one million Gmail users were hit by a fake Google Docs share request from one of their contacts. On the surface, this might sound like just another phishing email, no big deal. In reality, this scam reflects a sophisticated new tactic now in use by criminal hackers that will have major repercussions for businesses the world over. In fact, it's a technique that has already been perfected by the notorious Russian hacker group known as \"Pawn Storm\" (aka \"Fancy Bear\" or \"APT28\"), which has been accused of breaching the Democratic National Committee, the Hillary Clinton campaign and other high-profile targets. Here is a quick rundown on what every business owner needs to know. The attack, called \"OAuth phishing,\" is a potential game-changer for phishing attacks because it is tough to detect, hard to fix and easy for hackers to hijack online accounts. It exploits a serious weakness in the internet standard known as Open Authorization, or OAuth, which is relied upon by many of the world's top online service providers, including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Because of this, even if companies try to block specific attacks that exploit the OAuth privilege -- like Google did with the May 3 Google Docs scam -- it doesn't really fix the overall problem, and similar attacks can resurface over and over again. Cybercriminals will use OAuth phishing to takeover employee email accounts and then spread to other accounts, such as banking, accounting/payroll systems, cloud storage, client network logins, etc. Even if the victim resets the password, the hacker will be able to stay inside the account. The hacker can also bypass two-factor authentication protections. Businesses should expect to see a wave of OAuth phishing attacks in the coming months and years. Related: How to Protect Yourself and Your Business From Online Criminals Without getting too technical, OAuth is a way for Internet users to add third-party apps to existing online services (like Google, Facebook and Twitter) without having to share a password. In place of this password, the user agrees to the app's permission request(s), which then gives it an OAuth token it can use to access all or parts of the user's account. Here are some examples of these OAuth permissions with popular services. The problem with OAuth is that it's not always easy for a service provider to tell if the apps within its ecosystem are 100 percent legitimate and safe. Therein lies the problem, because if a hacker can trick Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter or other services into accepting a malicious app, he can exploit this trust relationship and hijack personal accounts. This is the essence of OAuth phishing -- tricking a service provider into accepting an app, then persuading Joe Schmo consumer to grant it account access. The way this is likely to work is the hacker will send a fake email notice in the form of a security alert, account update or new service offering, that purportedly comes from one of the above-listed service providers. If the user clicks to accept this request, he or she will then be redirected to the service provider's actual website (such as accounts.google.com or api.login.yahoo.com) to complete the authorization process. Notice how this is different from a traditional phishing scheme: Instead of being redirected to a fake URL, the victim is sent to a real website where the attack takes place. This makes it hard for average people to realize they're being scammed. (To better understand what these requests look like, see these write-ups by Trend Micro and CSO.) Once an individual has accepted the permission requests of a malicious app, the hacker is inside that account and will likely have full control. Since the OAuth token bypasses the need for a password, resetting the password after falling for this type of phishing email won't do any good. The person will have to go into their account settings and manually revoke access for the app -- but by that point it may be too late. Related: Trump Signs Executive Order on Cybersecurity Although this is a sophisticated attack, there are three types of tell-tale signs to look for. This first is a suspicious email address. Look to see if the sender's email points to an unfamiliar domain. The key is to look at what comes after the @ symbol. For example, one impostor Google app used \"no-reply.accounts.google@wpereview.org.\" However, hackers are also able to spoof emails so that they appear to come from a corporation, such as \"services@google.com.\" Check the full email header to be sure it's real. Hackers could make other slip-ups too. For example, in the Google Docs scam hackers inserted \"hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com\" into the \"To\" field, and BCC'ed the actual person receiving the email, both of which should have been dead give-aways. Next, inspect the language used in the email notice. Are there any spelling or grammatical errors? Does it sound like it was written by a non-native English speaker? Lastly, how much access is the app requesting? A legitimate app will seek some access, like the user's contacts or email address, but if it's asking for \"full access\" or administrative rights to the account (ex: \"view and manage your email\") that should raise alarms. One good thing about OAuth attacks is that the hacker can't hide the permission requests; this gives the user one last chance to hit the brakes before it's too late. Related: The Worst Hacks of 2017 -- So Far No business is able to prevent phishing attacks every single time, particularly when they are as advanced as the OAuth attack. It's therefore critical to have a good incident response plan, in addition to preventive security like firewalls, antivirus and email whitelisting. If an employee falls victim to an OAuth attack, the company should immediately revoke access for that fake app and check to see if the hacker was able to leverage it to get into any other accounts. Check every single account linked to the compromised email and revoke any permission requests, reset passwords and monitor the accounts closely for months afterward. Conduct a thorough examination of the affected employee's devices to see if malware or remote access tools were installed. Finally, check to see if phishing emails were sent to other employees via the hacked email account. Businesses also need to prevent a single employee from having too much access to sensitive information, accounts or systems. Segment the network as well to prevent a hacker or malware from spreading throughout a company after one employee is breached. Both of these measures will limit the potential fallout of any successful attack. Phishing attacks will continue to evolve over the coming years, so businesses have to develop a defense-in-depth approach that focuses equally on prevention and containment.

    "content": "When my co-founder and I were fleshing out the foundation of PolicyGenius, we knew our goal was to bring the insurance-buying process -- from education to shopping to application -- to the modern online consumer. The question was, \"How do we do this?\" And as we spoke to consumers about their decision journeys, we realized that the answer wasn't new. It had been around for 30 years. Time after time, unprompted, we'd get asked why there wasn't something like TurboTax for insurance. TurboTax helped pioneer robo-advice in household finances by offering expert-level guidance without requiring a face-to-face appointment with a specialist. It showed that it could be done for a complex financial process (there isn't anything more complicated than filing your taxes, is there?) and now robo-advisors are taking over the investing world thanks to the likes of Tradeking, Wealthfront, Betterment, and more. <!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Related: 11 Ways to Make Money While You Sleep So the people we wanted to reach wanted TurboTax for insurance: something where they could go through the insurance shopping process -- the whole process -- online, getting guidance that they could follow at their own pace. Here's what we learned by building it. You can find and compare insurance policies on PolicyGenius, so it's tempting to describe the process as like \"Kayak, but for insurance.\" But unlike travel aggregators, we don't just gather a bunch of deals and show them side-by-side on the screen. We can't. Insurance is more complicated than flights, so we have to do more. When you go on vacation you buy your plane ticket, go on the trip, post the pictures to Facebook, and go back to your life. Insurance, especially life insurance, is more expensive, longer-term, and more complex. Choosing the wrong flight means you have to wake up early or have no legroom, but messing up your insurance policy has real consequences. That's why we emphasize education and decision support. We built a resource center with content that explains different concepts, terms, and scenarios. During the application process, we explain why we're asking for each piece of information. And with our Insurance Checkup, we show you not only what sort of protection you need, but why you need it. For a lot of people, shopping online for insurance means plugging your personal information into a form and waiting to get called by a horde of salespeople. That's not a good experience. Customers don't want to just be added to a call list. They're trying to protect the wellbeing of themselves and their family; being little more than a stepping stone for a salesperson to get closer to their quota isn't reassuring. Instead, we gave people a full shopping experience: go from research to application at your own pace, and only give up your contact information when you're ready to take the next step in completing your application. <!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Related: How to Start a Business With (Almost) No Money And insurance isn't something that people think about all the time. That means you have a limited window to reach (and keep) them. How do you make the most of that time? By giving them all of the information and tools they need to go through the whole process upfront without needing to jump through hoops. In other words, don't waste their time. Showing them the opportunity and value of life insurance through educational content and an easy-to-use process gives users the confidence that they can buy a policy without hassle and benefit from it for years to come. It's easy to write off digital experiences as only being appealing for Millennials. And even though Millennials make up half of our customer base, that means that half of our users  are from older, more affluent segments - and yet they still use and enjoy our digital experience. Remember, they've lived most of their lives in a world where TurboTax is the way millions of people do their taxes. They're not new to this. Where do you integrate robo-advice? Wherever you can in the funnel - which, as it turns out, is every step.  For example, we customize content and advice so that we're giving customers relevant information. Even though the advice is \"robo\" that doesn't mean it's impersonal. If you can translate the type of advice a human insurance agent would deliver in the \"kitchen table conversation\" into an algorithm, then you can deliver tailored advice in a self-service, automated fashion. That's what our Insurance Checkup does: in five minutes customers can find out exactly what type of coverage they need based on their financial situation. It doesn't stop there, though. We provide instant, accurate, automated quotes with advanced underwriting techniques; at the evaluation stage, we've built plain-English content and decision-support features that answer the most important questions insurance shoppers have; our insurer report cards highlight all the ratings and customer \"moments of truth\" essential for the purchasing decision. Step by step, we make learning about, applying for, and purchasing insurance easy and self-directed. And what happens when you put robo-advisor tools in place in the funnel? More than you'd think. <!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Related: Habits of the World's Wealthiest People (Infographic) Our customers spend a lot of time on the research and decision-making steps of the process because we've given them personalized content to dig through. They answer a lot of high-friction questions to get accurate quotes (more questions than a typical UX/UI designer would think is possible) and spend upwards of 10 minutes on our site per transaction. There's only a few days between when they begin the process and when they finish their application, and a vast majority of our users do finish their application once they start - enough that we've seen 20% month-over-month growth when the rest of the life insurance industry has stayed relatively flat. We've done this by enabling people to buy life insurance the way they want to: with plenty of advice, on their own terms, instantly. We aren't all suited for robo-advice just yet. Whether it's because we're concerned about the security implications of entering all of our financial information online or we just like having an expert sit down with us and answer questions in real life, an agent works better for some people. Although we've been able to reach across generational gaps at PolicyGenius, studies show that older generations (sorry 35 year olds, you're an \"older generation\" now) are more likely to prefer a face-to-face experience at some point, while younger people are more comfortable with a fully online process - according to an AXA survey 34% of Millennials want to interact with their insurer solely online, and 8% don't want to interact with them at all. But it's not just an age thing. Whether or not people want to apply for life insurance online depends on their needs and their do-it-yourself orientation; where they fall on that spectrum dictates where you can fit robo-advisor tools into the process to make their experience as seamless as possible.  On one end, you have someone with simple needs -- they just want a pretty straightforward life insurance policy, for instance -- and they're comfortable going through it themselves; you can automate every step of the process, from education all the way through to checkout. They don't have to talk to a single person if they don't want to. Then you get to people who want to do it on their own but need an agent due to their financial situation: high net worth consumers with complicated estate planning needs are probably better served with a personal advisor at some point in the process. The inverse of the latter customer is the consumer who wants (more than needs) an agent but it may not be feasible for them to be supported every step of the way because it's not cost-effective for the agent to handle every step of the process for them. For these customers, you can complement their journey with robo-advisor tools -- let them go through as much as they can on their own and having an agent step in only when necessary so the agent doesn't have to invest too much in time or resources for a simple policy. And finally, at the other end of our spectrum, there's the traditional agent model for anyone who doesn't want to go through the process alone or  has complicated needs that an experienced professional can help with. 69% of respondents to a recent Allianz survey said they don't trust advice found online, so they'd rather work with an agent than a robo-advisor -- so there's still a market out there for them. The life insurance industry has been around for a long time. We're not going to revolutionize it overnight. We don't have to, and we don't want to -- it's a large, complex industry, and a lot of people still find value in the way it currently works. But we shouldn't fight the tools and technology that are available to us, and implementing robo-advisors is one of the incremental changes we can put in place to make buying life insurance easier for everyone.

    "content": "1 in 5 adults in the United States suffering from hearing loss. The World Health Organization puts the global number of those with disabling hearing loss at about 360 million people. Given the size of this health concern, its no wonder startups are popping up to address hearing loss in a variety of ways. Here's a rundown on a few of the most prominent startups in the hearing impairment space. Since opening its doors in 2012, this New York startup has saved consumers over $40 million with its direct-to-consumer selling model: They offer \"sleek hearing aid models and collaborations with iconic influencers.\" And since they're selling to people directly, they need to be able to help their customers identify their exact level of hearing loss. Audicus's new hearing assessment tech will allow users to check up on their hearing online, for free. It's a great first stop for anyone concerned about their hearing. If you're hearing impaired, you know what it's like to attend an event -- college lecture, graduation ceremony, or church service -- and not have a clue what anyone's saying. This Korean startup offers a voice-operated typing and transmission service that can be used to provide real-time captioning for a hearing impaired person. Sovoro will support 80 languages, thanks to its reliance on Google's engine to take its notes. These two biotech startups have the same goal: Developing drugs to remedy hearing loss. David Lucchino, CEO of Frequency Therapeutics, gave some insight on the problem in an article for MedCity News: \"It's noise pollution. There was a great study about people who were born and spent their lives on Easter Island and people who left. The people who stayed had great hearing well into their 60s. The people exposed to noise pollution had the same kinds of hearing loss we see every day.\" Frequency hopes to stimulate the correct cells in order to jumpstart healthy tissues that can help people hear. Decibel is looking at even more ways to return the inner ear to its former self -- and with their $52 million Series A a few years back, they should have plenty of runway. Ava pioneers a new level of accessibility for the deaf or hearing impaired. When at a family dinner or small gathering, the app can be downloaded by everyone and the voice-recognition software will translate the conversation into a series of text-message like notes, keeping any hearing impaired group member in the loop and able to respond in real time.

    "content": "Sales teams often mimic the bell curves we remember so dearly from our days of high school. A small number of people stand above the rest, some lag behind, and the majority lie somewhere near the median. Unlike high school, however, the folks on the wrong side of the sales team bell curve have a material impact on the financial stability of the company. A lot of sales leaders focus on rewarding the high performers so that they'll continue to produce, while letting the rest of the team drag behind before they either catch up or give up. The \"fire fast\" or \"churn and burn\" mentality is a staple in sales environments, especially in early stage startups where revenue determines whether or not the lights will be on tomorrow. But is this the best approach to building a great sales team? During my first role ever as a sales manager we took the company from very minimal revenue to over $3 million in monthly recurring revenue in less than one year. This growth was driven almost entirely from building a culture of learning. As reps learned what worked and what didn't, we were very intentional about spreading the good processes to the rest of the team and scrapping the rest. This formula has proved true in each sales team I've scaled since, all growing to eight figures or more in annual revenue. This process, unbeknownst to me at the time, is what Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the book Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard, call finding the bright spots. Their assertion is that when solving large, complicated problems that require significant change, you have to start with finding the bright spots, or things that are going well, in the situation and expand upon those. This assertion is an apt analogy for building and scaling sales teams. Instead of letting the stars shine while the rest fall behind, there are bright spots to be gleaned from what the top performers are doing differently, and those bright spots can be taught and ingrained in the sales reps that aren't performing as well. Here's how to do it: In order to find the bright spots in your best sales reps, you have to be measuring various things throughout the sales process. This data is what provides you with the deviation point where the best reps begin to shine and the rest fall behind. Every sales process involves different steps and stages, but in general, you should be measuring things like quantity of outbound emails or phone calls, the content or message of those emails and calls, response rates to emails and phone calls, conversion rates along each step in the sales process, and overall time to close These measurements are what begin to paint the picture of what makes your best sales reps great. In sales, most things are teachable, so you can very likely elevate the rest of the team to levels at or near the top performers, which then continues to push the boundaries for success. Here are a few examples of where the things you measure might point to the bright spots where you can elevate the rest of the team. Sales Rep A is sending 25 outbound emails per day, while Sales Rep B is sending 15 outbound emails per day. On average, Sales Rep A is getting 1 phone call scheduled out of those 25 emails (4% conversion), while Sales Rep B is getting 2 phone calls scheduled out of those 15 emails (13% conversion). This likely points to a bright spot in the content of Sales Rep B's emails. By sitting down with Sales Rep B and understanding what they're saying in their emails and why they think it's working, you can then apply similar messaging to Sales Rep A's emails. Sales Rep A is giving an average of 5 demos per week, and on average 2 of them leads to a free trial account (40% conversion). Sales Rep B is giving an average of 8 demos per week, and on average 1 of them leads to a free trial account (13% conversion). This likely points to a bright spot in either the quality of Sales Rep A's demos or in their ability to clearly ask for and move the prospect to the trial stage. By shadowing Sales Rep A's demos you can learn why they are having more success, and train Sales Rep B to mimic their process. The average close time from initial touch point to new business for Sales Rep A is 2 weeks. The average close time for Sales Rep B is 4 weeks. By sitting with Sales Rep A to understand their sales process you learn that they try to get on the phone with the prospect as soon as possible to avoid delays from back and forth emails. By sitting with Sales Rep B to understand their sales process you learn that they prefer selling over email instead of the phone which leads to much longer sales cycles. This shows you a bright spot in Sales Rep A's process is the ability to condense weeks of emails into a single phone call which saves both the rep and prospect time. You can teach this to Sales Rep B and help them get more comfortable on the phone, which will shorten their close time, and in turn increase their sales numbers. Sales environments can be overly competitive and hostile when the sales team views each other as competition. But when you build and grow your sales team by finding and expanding upon the bright spots, you create an inclusive culture that is centered on camaraderie, learning, and growth. The mindset shifts from me to we and everyone benefits. Some leaders might fear that this approach will kill the competitive nature that drives sales achievements, but I've found the opposite to be true. When you shift the culture to one of continual learning and individual as well as team growth, the competitive spirit is still there. It just moves inward. People begin to compete with themselves while helping the rest of their team do the same. Wins become things that the entire team celebrates, not just an individual and their manager.

    "content": "Startup Founders may wonder how they would benefit from being a part of an accelerator. As one who ran the Sprint Accelerator powered by Techstars from 2014-2016, I saw many examples of the ecosystem in action - it is so vast and comprised of different types of people - entrepreneurs, mentors, investors, corporate partners - the benefits of being a part of an accelerator ecosystem benefits are equally diverse. One great example is the Firebrand Ventures investment in Sickweather, a Techstars alumni company.  Sickweather is a sickness forecasting and mapping app that scans social media for reports of illness and uses a patent pending process to turn those reports into accurate real-time and forecasted sickness data. For those lil ones that are prone to catching every germ and bug out there, this app can tell you what illnesses are popping up in your area and forecast future outbreaks. This startup was part of the first class of the Sprint Accelerator powered by Techstars in 2014 and made fantastic progress during the program, even inking a deal with Sprint's mobile ad division Pinsight Media.  After Demo Day,  Sickweather set out to raise capital and landed an investment from Brad Feld's FG Angels syndicate. Even though CEO Graham Dodge and his team went back to Baltimore and California after the program, they kept in touch by sending regular email updates to mentors and investors. I can't overstate how important this is! David Cohen wrote about this in his blog post Don't Go Dark. By having founders do this, it was one of the ways I learned Sickweather landed key partners including The Weather Channel and Clorox. They also always gave a heads up when they were visiting conferences or coming back to Kansas City. There were valuable touch points to keep the relationship strong.  In August 2016 I transitioned from my Techstars Managing Director role to a full-time investor and launched Firebrand Ventures, a seed fund that invests in early-stage software startups in the Midwest. Techstars was hugely supportive. My mentors Brad Feld and David Cohen provided invaluable advice and I was fortunate to add David as an advisor. Find out what other startups doing to attract investors When Graham told me they were raising a round it was a relatively easy decision to invest in them. Graham did his part by keeping me up to date about their great progress and ended up a great fit for our investment criteria. Most importantly, I had known him and his core team for over three years. I always thought the health data analytics part of their business had huge potential and after two years their data set had become valuable to consumer health and pharma companies. I joined their board shortly after Firebrand invested. Ever since that 2014 Techstars program, Graham and his cofounders loved Kansas City for its super supportive community, great food and music, and low cost of living. As a result of the Firebrand investment, Sickweather decided to open an office in Kansas City and possibly move the headquarters there. The KC startup community is buzzing and it's perfect timing as the new Techstars Kansas City program kicks off in July. The Techstars network is also fantastic for funds like Firebrand. It's no coincidence that three of our first four investments so far were in Techstars alumni. Beyond investments, I'm a big believer in Give First. I plan to continue mentoring at as many Techstars programs as possible. I look forward to continuing to play an active role and investing in more great Techstars companies!

    "content": "With so many paths to success, the research field of entrepreneurship began to emerge and studying the various interdisciplinary fields that integrate into the overall success became an important tool to understanding the why. Prior to Techstars, I worked in research at the Kauffman Foundation. We marveled at the newness of the general academic study of entrepreneurship. There are many theories to the different epochs that developed research in entrepreneurship, but no doubt that it in the past couple decades the the study of entrepreneurship has become a rapidly evolving and critical field of study from top universities. When studying entrepreneurship, we need to consider other disciplines, psychology, sociology, anthropology, management, finance, economics, and on and on, to get a full understanding as to the individual, team, company, and market factors that affect whether the endeavor will be successful. Each of those disciplines take on a different type of data point and methodology for study, together giving a more complete picture of entrepreneurship. And we took this enigmatic topic, and put infrastructure around it. There is a correlation between comedy and entrepreneurship To understand how the discipline evolved, you have to look at the history. From 100 formal entrepreneurship programs in 1975, to 500 in 2006, to many schools requiring education in entrepreneurship in 2013. From 250 entrepreneurship courses in 1985 to more than 5,000 in 2008, a strong focus on entrepreneurship is practically an expectation at universities today. And then, accelerators came on scene. The first accelerator, Y Combinator, was started in 2005 and a year later, Techstars was founded. And now, somewhere between 300 and 2,000 accelerators exist around the world, according to researchers Susan Cohen and Yael Hochberg. And, we're getting better at identifying what it takes to qualify as an accelerator.  As the researchers explain, programs such as Techstars fall into the category of seed accelerators, or \"a fixed-term, cohort-based program, including mentorship and educational components, that culminates in a public pitch event or demo day.\" In terms of research, accelerators are only 12 years old and data is still in its early stages. CrunchBase, AngelList, and the accelerators themselves are commonly used as data sources for researchers in this area. However, new methodologies are being developed using techniques like randomized controlled trials to measure certain interventions in entrepreneur's success.  So, why does the study of entrepreneurship help startups? Simply put, research improves conditions. In starting up an accelerator program, I'm learning quickly that unknown unknowns naturally arise. Questions like: how can accelerators best serve a diverse pool of founders? When is the right time for a company to join an accelerator? Research seeks to better understand the unknowns and accelerators seek to better improve outcomes for their entrepreneurs. The two go hand in hand. The more unknowns we face, the harder it is to run a successful program. And, when companies join us, we're putting emphasis on our beliefs and methodologies (say, the particulars of building a pricing structure) that we as an accelerator hold as truth for long term success in a company, and we ought to know with certainty and evidence that those things really do matter for founders. Researchers and accelerators need to get better at collecting data on entrepreneurial outcomes to conduct studies on the work that we do. One of the great things about Techstars is that it was started by engineers who love data, and love making that data public. Transparency and honest data is critical to improving the conditions on something that we are all on the very cutting edge of developing (accelerators). With every passing year, we know more about entrepreneurs and how to make companies more successful who enter our accelerator programs. It is an exciting time to be a part of this experiment -- creating infrastructure on the phenomenon of entrepreneurship.

This week in our Startup Spotlight, we've uncovered startups that are helping families check off their to do lists, fitness classes at a discount price, emerging technology in VR, and more. This week's Startup Spotlight is brought to you by The Hoth, an SEO & Content Company. Finding babysitters for your kids is an ongoing task for a parent, and when there's an urgent need sometimes your regular girl isn't available, then what do you do? Zipsit to the rescue. This Phoenix-based startup is a comprehensive rating system that helps parents choose from hundreds of quality babysitters in your area that your friend's also use. Users can connect with sitters and grow their circle with feedback from other parents' reviews. Users develop a personal network of sitters called the \"Sitter Circle\" and when there is a need, then it can work as a babysitter on-demand system. Also, users won't need to run to the ATM to pay their sitter as the transactions can be completed in-app.  Virtual reality is becoming more consumer-friendly and with it comes the need for higher quality video resolution and transmission to reduce latency. VR UniBlock addresses this need and developed a wireless system for transmitting 4k/120Hz video with a delay of up to 3ms. Founded by Askar Khamidov, the VR UniBlock algorithm enables the swift transmission of any data without impacting resolution or latency. This new patent-pending technology has an unlimited potential for transmitting any amount of data without limit but to a closed indoor space, without tethers or any noticeable delay. Originally, VR UniBlock team invented a sensor system for transmitting data but the team pivoted when they realized a huge market need for a better way to transmit video for virtual reality tech.  Image: Flickr For those looking for a last-minute fitness class or want to try a different type of workout, Opensweat a Los Angeles-based startup, can help you find what you want on-demand for less. Think of it as the HotelsTonight app for fitness where you can find fitness options at the last minute. Users can scroll through the app to find a variety of classes and services and book the class for a discounted fee.  For parents that are staring down college applications with their child, compiling their activities and extracurricular into one place is time consuming. MePlusMore is a Phoenix-based startup that can help students create a timeline of their accomplishments to be used as a competitive advantage when applying for colleges and scholarships. The app uses a student's electronic calendar to capture nontraditional activities, hobbies, skills as well as photos, awards, etc. to create a personal eNarrative. While changing air filters in your home is a pain, it can save you money. But when it's time to change them out, more often than not you don't have a backup or the right size. Time to check that task off the list as this Raleigh-based startup FilterEasy will deliver air filters to your door when you need them. The process is meant to be easy: users can select the number of filters, the type of filter grade, the sizes they want, click, and done.  To create a space where Cannabis businesses can advertise to their users and other vendors, Chicago-based startup Kannatopia developed a social platform where they can reach their audience with targeted advertising without the concern of getting shut down. On the flip side, users must be 21+ to access the platform, and are able to connect with other medical and recreational cannabists through an interactive map, as well as track products, provide reviews and discuss cannabis freely without the concern of social and professional backlash. To date they have over 1,000 subscribed users for public beta. Read more about startups here at Tech.Co. This is our new, premium Weekly Spotlight Announcement Series.

    "content": "We've all heard the saying: you are what you eat. For food, this is clearly not a literal saying, but what we consume does contribute to our health and that is why quality is so important. This particularly true when it comes to meat, as many grocery stores are unnecessarily vague about where specifically your food comes from. As a result, more restaurants have embraced the farm-to-table concept, not only informing us of where the food comes from, but also ensuring its freshness due to less time in transit. But what if you want beef from that same local rancher? In most cases it's an arduous, antiquated process consisting of going to the ranch, getting on a list, and then freezing an excessive amount of beef in a deep freezer. A growing startup, Crowd Cow, is changing this one cut of beef at a time. More specifically, Crowd Cow allows consumers to crowdfund, or crowd carve up an entire cow, selecting various cuts of beef. In addition to picking the cuts, they also provide details regarding the type of cow, location it was raised, types of food it ate, and even how the rancher cared for the cow.  If the concept sounds familiar that's because it's a new take on an old approach. In the past if you wanted to know exactly where your beef came from you'd have to go either to the farmers market or to a rancher (sometimes you'll get lucky with a great local butcher). When working with a rancher, typically you're buying a large portion of the cow, and that means you'll have nearly an endless amount of beef if your freezer at all times. I first learned of the concept in college when a friend brought over an entire cooler filled with steaks to store in our freezer because she ran out of space in her own. And if there is one thing a college kitchen needs is more freezer space for the wonderfully terrible food we ate. Between technology, Crowd Cow's innovative approach to shipping, and tapping into the largest pool of meat eaters in the US (the internet), they effectively add a much desired component to beef buying, knowledge. One could argue that this does remove some of the locality out of the process; however, the team behind the beef is no stranger to food or programming (founders of Urbanspoon and Snapvine), which ensures the beef gets to you in the most optimal way using the ideal temperature along the way. On top of this, as the company finishes up its nationwide rollout, more and more local ranches will become accessible, bringing your local ranches right to your door. How important is knowledge about where your food comes? For starters, it's worth at least $2 million in seed funding that Crowd Cow closed this January, including funds from NFL hall of famer Joe Montana. As a meal prepper, knowing about my food is just as important as figuring out what I'm going to torture myself with for the next five days of lunches. With Crowd Cow, not only do you get the basics, you get first-hand information about how it was raised and cared for.  For example, at the time of writing, Crowd Cow currently has a cow from Spanaway, WA on the block. Hailing from the Harlow Cattle Company, their cows are premium quality angus hereford crosses that are raised on 320 acres of prairie land where they've fed on grass their entire life. If that's not enough, here's a sampling of information straight from the rancher herself (more here): \"I have not hired help running the ranch and cattle operation. Day and night, rain and shine, 24x7, 365 days a year, from bucking hay to vetting calves, weighing steers to mending fences, round-ups to bookkeeping, mud and manure, dust and dirt, I do all the ranch work myself,\" stated Becky Harlow Weed. What you're getting with Crowd Cow is access to small, sustainable farms. Sure, on the surface the crowdfunding component is a bit of a gimmick, but by going in together with other people who care about what they eat, it ensures the entire cow will be used. \"You can go to the farmers market, if you remember, and maybe he has the cut you want or maybe didn't bring it. We are trying to get people a lot more access to beef they can feel really good about. I love local, and I love the idea of people being able to try things from various places,\" said Crowd Cow Cofounder Ethan Lowry. The best comparison to what they Crowd Cow is creating can be seen in the craft beer market. If you are on the east coast you can easily get beer from the Chicago, DC, or Baltimore regions, including their specialty beers, but if you head over to California you're less likely to find Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA. For those in California, they get the coveted Pliny the Elder, with little to no distribution elsewhere. Just the same, Crowd Cow is not just acting as the distributor for locally and sustainably raised beef, it's generating revenue for the little guys and gals. \"Our farms have distinctive flavors. Not just this homogeneous food they've been used to. Each farmer/rancher and even breed affects the taste. I love the idea of people developing an affinity for the one they want,\" said Lowry. Crowd Cow is a Seattle-based startup and is rolling out their nationwide offering. Until now they have primarily offered their small sustainable beer to the West Coast region, but are now on a mission to connect with ranchers outside the industrial beef industry.

    "content": "Love is a big part of being an entrepreneur. With it, you can conquer stressful investor meetings, eccentric employee interviews, and unimpressive projection numbers without batting an eye. But without it, you're chance of success are limited, as passion and commitment are integral to the entrepreneurial process. And if you think this love is second only to the love between a parent and a child, you're half right. According to a recent study out of Aalto University, parental and entrepreneurial love are one in the same when it comes to brain chemistry and emotional experience. The study was very comprehensive, covering everything from sensitivity in threatening situations to elation in response to reward, leading researchers to determine that startups, like children, illicit quite the emotional response in their founders and parents. \"Our results are among the first to address the brain basis of entrepreneurship and they show that the strong attachment entrepreneurs can have to their venture is reflected in the same brain areas as the attachment between a parent and a child,\" wrote Marja-Liisa Halko, Tom Lahti, Kaisa Hytonen, and Iiro P. Jaaskelainen, the authors of the study. By showing founders pictures of their companies along side similar companies, while simultaneously showing fathers pictures of their children along side other children, researchers were able to deduce a notable similarity in their brain activity. The study thoroughly dives into the various parts of the brain and their level of activity during the study, but I'm no brain surgeon, so you'll just have to read for yourself. If you're a parent, this kind of study might be hard to swallow. After all, you've lost sleep, foregone a personal life, and spent quite a bit of money into your child's success. Running a company couldn't possibly compare to raising an actual, living, breathing human being.  Actually, it's almost exactly like that. Entrepreneurship is built on a foundation of burning the midnight oil, missing social gatherings, and investing capital in something you want to succeed more than anything else in the world. Like it or not, entrepreneurs are just as much a parent as you are, outside of changing diapers. While the parental love felt by entrepreneurs is kind of cute, according to the study, it might not be good for business. Just like someone in a toxic long term relationship, entrepreneurs are more inclined to ignore red flags and sweep problems under the rug because \"that's my baby.\" \"Entrepreneurs 'in love' rely on their subjective beliefs represented in 'an inside view' which perceives the details of one's own firm as unique and ignore or underweight objective information that may undermine these beliefs,\" wrote the authors of the study. Love is rarely a bad thing. It motivates us to accomplish incredible feats of innovation in the face of insurmountable odds.  However, it's important to remember that love, on more than one occasion, has led to a few poor choices in the history of humanity. So let your love guide those decisions that require passion, but don't let it weigh in when you need to make the hard decisions. Read more about being an entrepreneur here on Tech.Co ",

    "content": "The gender problem in tech is well-documented. While more and more women entrepreneurs are getting involved in the startup world, opportunities for success remain few and far between as venture capital still isn't finding it's way into the budgets of these women-led companies. Fortunately, someone is doing something about it. Women You Should Fund is a crowdfunding platform launched by Women You Should Know, a leading women's and girls' empowerment brand established in 2011. The cofounders aim to leverage the massive network of women influencers in the entrepreneurial system in order to get funding to women-led companies working hard to empower each other. \"What we hear over and over is that there never seem to be enough dollars to go around when it comes to helping women get their products, projects, and business ventures off the ground,\" said Cynthia Hornig, cofounder of Women You Should Know in a press release. \"So we decided to do something about it because now, more than ever, our country is desperate for a more dynamic and diverse ecosystem of women entrepreneurs and leaders.\" While most crowdfunding platforms have little influence outside of the companies network, Women You Should Fund hopes to tap into the palpable energy of women entrepreneurs to spread the love around when it comes to venture capital. Because if you've got an entire gender on your side, you can do anything. \"Most crowdfunding starts and stops with a campaign creator's personal network or social circle,\" said Jen Jones, another cofounder of Women You Should Know. \"But through our collective brand assets, we can put a Women You Should Fund campaign as well as the story of the women behind it in front of our sister community. In turn, a campaign creator's circle of potential backers gets that much bigger... and success gets that much closer.\" I'll be the first to admit that it would be nice to not have to talk about this anymore. However, the lack of women in tech is creating a decidedly pressing issue for the rights of women, along with the bottom line of your company.

    "content": "Finding clean energy solutions is no easy feat. Recently, some of Silicon Valley's sharpest data science minds came together to use their powers for good at the U.S. Department of State's Clean Energy Data Science Challenge, co-hosted by Booz Allen Hamilton, the World Bank and Galvanize San Francisco, to develop solutions for those without access to reliable electricity. According to the World Energy Outlet over 1.2 billion people around the world lack access to reliable electricity in 2016. The objective of the Clean Energy Data Science Challenge was to mine and leverage open data to promote the development of innovative and scalable solutions. Read an inspiring story about life as a data scientist There were 15 companies who presented with solutions to address global problems around energy; of those companies, three active students and an alumnus of the University of New Haven-Galvanize Master of Science in Data Science program, and two current students in the Galvanize Data Science Immersive program also participated. Challenge winners (clockwise from upper left): Zachary Thomas (Galvanize DSI), Jason Chiang (Galvanize DSI), Cameron Kruse (National Geographic), Mehmet Turanalp (Vakif Bank), Victor Garcia (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), Anthony Abercrombie (gU4), Lukmaan Bawazer (gU4). Not pictured: Baolin Liu (gU3). The winning team created a mock startup called Cartesian Product, a clean energy knowledge management platform that enables a diverse set of users to identify high-potential emerging energy markets. The vision is to crowdsource the collection of ground-truth data to domain experts, enabling machine learning solutions that optimize alternative energy investment on a global scale. As Zvika Krieger notes in her Medium article about the Challenge, \"Providing access to energy can enable progress across education, health, social and economic sectors\" in the developing world and beyond. We're grateful to have access to reliable electricity, and to be working with and learning from dynamic people who are applying their ingenuity and expertise to helping others gain access to a resource that is often taken for granted.

    "content": "The Kauffman Foundation's annual Startup Activity Index has just dropped for the year, and with it a collection of data-driven insights on the state of the startup ecosystem. Naturally, we took a look at the report ahead of its release online today, and have brought you the top nine most interesting and useful facts from the 52-page national report. With no further ado, here are the various directions that 2017's startup trends are heading. We already knew the Startup Activity Index has risen sharply over 2014 and 2015. Now we know it saw a slight increase in 2016 as well. That's good news... the Index was at a twenty year low just three years ago, so any growth is good growth. From the report: \"Despite the recent positive trend, new businesses with employees--those creating jobs for people besides the entrepreneur--are still in a long-term decline compared to levels in the 1980s.\" 310 out of every 100,000 adults became new entrepreneurs on any given month in 2016, a number down from 330 adults the year prior. Still, across that U.S., that's 540,000 new business owners each month. Tips on how to build a business culture Entrepreneurs either strike out on their own after seeing an opportunity or after becoming unemployed first. In 2016, the \"Opportunity Share of New Entrepreneurs\" was 86.3 percent. As Kauffman puts it, that's \"more than twelve percentage points higher than it was in 2009 at the height of the Great Recession.\" However, that success story doesn't hold true for all demographics: \"The rise in Opportunity Share of New Entrepreneurs has been widespread across most demographic groups. Nonetheless, opportunity entrepreneurship is much lower for adults without formal higher education--compared to adults with college education; as well as for Blacks and Latinos, compared to Whites and Asians.\" Most new entrepreneurs in the U.S. are still white.  Kauffman's \"Startup Density\" estimates went up in 2016. This stat refers to those startups that are at a late enough stage to begin hiring additional employees, and can be stacked against more traditional businesses. In 2015, we saw 81.6 startups per 1,000 employer businesses, and that number has now bumped up a few percentage points to 85.4. \"Immigrants are almost twice as likely as the native-born to become entrepreneurs,\" the Index reports, \"with the Rate of New Entrepreneurs being 0.52 percent for immigrants, compared to 0.26 percent for the native-born.\" Immigrant entrepreneurs accounted for almost 30 percent of all new entrepreneurs in 2016, a number way up from 13 percent back in 1996. As the report explains it: \"The percentage of immigrant entrepreneurs in the United States is on a two-decade high, reflecting the United States' increasing population of immigrants as well as the much higher Rate of New Entrepreneurs among immigrants.\" Older adults are on the rise in the U.S. entrepreneurial population: \"Individuals ages fifty-five to sixty-four have gone from making up 14.8 percent of new entrepreneurs in 1996 to 25.5 percent of all new entrepreneurs in 2016.\" (This might be a good time to mention Tech.Co's \"Founders Over 40\" series.) Meanwhile, those entering the entrepreneurial field during the ages of twenty to thirty-four has dropped: It was 24.4 percent in 2016, but 34.3 percent in 1996. To be fair, the educational backgrounds for entrepreneurs remain pretty diverse. The biggest chunk of educational real estate, however, are college degree holders. A little fewer than a third of new entrepreneurs hold degrees: \"Since 1996, the share of new entrepreneurs who were college graduates has increased from 23.7 percent to 30.1 percent. This makes entrepreneurs with college degrees the biggest educational category of new entrepreneurs in the United States.\"  New veteran entrepreneurs are a shrinking chunk of the U.S. entrepreneurial population, but that's understandable, given that their overall population in the country is also on the decline. That doesn't mean you can't read more about veteran entrepreneurs at Tech.Co, natch -- they may be small, but their support system remains healthy.

We haven't had a week without rain since September, and I love it. But the U.S. city with the biggest, most outsized rep for ex-pat love is the Big Apple itself. And as of today, those pining for a taste of New York City finally have a chance to soak in a little of their favorite neighborhood. Workspace startup Breather is offering a web app that curates the sounds of New York City: The online app Sounds of New York holds mastered clips recorded in 27 neighborhoods, from Times Square to Chinatown. It's an immersive example of the unique aspects of the city: Harlem has notes of jazz, while parts of Nolita were recorded at the Supreme store. Better yet, it's an interesting look at the creative storytelling that a startup can lean on in order to call attention to their services. I spoke with Vanda Daftari, Head of Creative at Breather, to learn more about the ambient noise app: \"This is our approach to content,\" Vanda told me. \"At Breather, we're focusing on making things that people use and love, and we feel that our content should be no different.\"  What are Breather's goals for the service? \"Breather is all about helping you find your focus as humanly as possible -- now through the medium of audio,\" Vanda explained. \"Sounds of New York provides an ambient noise soundtrack for you to play in the background while you're working. We just happened to curate these particular background sounds from famous locations throughout NYC neighborhoods, to create a tribute to a city we love.\" I love the booming podcast industry, and ambient noise is an interesting yet often overlooked aspect of the non-music audio world. Here's hoping Breather keeps exploring new soundscapes in the future! Read more about the podcast sector here at Tech.Co. ",

    "content": "Sweden has emerged as a fintech powerhouse in Europe. In 2016 alone, Sweden-based fintech companies closed 35 rounds of funding, according to Breakit. This brings Sweden's haul to 40 percent of all funding rounds in Europe for the past five years. Sweden now has the highest number of fintech investments per capital. As a country, Sweden has become the world's best model for a cashless society. Only less than 2 percent of payment transactions in the country were made using cash in 2015. Many of its banks don't even allow cash transactions anymore. As such, cashless payments have become a core vertical to the rise of Sweden's fintech scene. For peer-to-peer fund transfers, people use Swish which is an app from the collaboration between Sweden's major banks. For payments to businesses, payment solutions like iZettle, Klarna, and Trustly are the most popular. Interestingly, all of these companies are homegrown ventures but they are also finding success across border as more countries strive towards cashless. iZettle and Klarna already reached unicorn status while Trustly is poised to do the same after a strong 2016 where the company performed EUR3.2 billion in transactions. Other fintech segments are also gaining ground. Virtual banking app Tink secured $10 million in funding last year while crowd lending service Kameo secured $1.2 million in funding last year. Non-fintech unicorn companies also came from Sweden, such as music service Spotify, game developer King (makers of Candy Crush), and Skype. As such, Sweden is considered to be the second-largest unicorn breeding ground in the world.  Swedish fintech companies also credit their talent pool for their continued success. In a recent Ernst and Young event, officers from several Stockholm-based tech companies shared their thoughts on the challenges in human resources that their companies face. Ulrica Falkenberg, chief human resources officer of Trustly, said, \"I think one important thing that we have managed to do is find the truly best talents for those early recruitments. Good people know good people, and want to work with other competent people. A large portion of our new hires come through internal referrals.\" Read about startups emerging in London There's plenty of local talent to tap into as the population boasts of a highly educated population and 40 percent of Stockholm's inhabitants have at least a three-year post-secondary education. Johan Attby, CEO of Fishbrain, banks on the loyalty of Swedish tech professionals. \"In Stockholm it's competitive, but if you manage to hire someone, they will stick with you,\" he said. Still, Swedish companies must also be able to look outward to continue their growth. Hiring in tech has become quite competitive these days especially in Europe. The EU allows for professionals to easily relocate to any of the major tech hubs located in its member countries. As such, major tech hubs are all vying to attract the best tech talent especially in light of Brexit. Aside from Stockholm, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Dublin are all keen on attracting companies and talent to relocate. Berlin and Amsterdam are highly cosmopolitan and many professionals find it easy to adjust to life once they relocate. Berlin even boasts of lower costs of living especially when compared to New York or London. Not to be left out, Stockholm is a worthy rival to Berlin and Amsterdam. Sweden was named the best country to raise a family, companies offer flexible work hours, there's also strong emphasis to gender equality and English is also widely spoken. These perks make Sweden a sensible destination for tech professionals looking for a change in environment. Further growth of fintech has come from a convergence of entrepreneurs, the government, and talent. Thankfully, stakeholders are creating an ecosystem that's nurtures innovation. The Stockholm Fintech Hub, which is a collaboration among KPMG, Partner BLC Avisors, Invest Stockholm, and NFT Ventures, launched earlier this year. The hub offers coworking spaces, a conference center, and educational programs to support fintech ventures. Fintech in Europe is expected to blow up by 2018 as the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) takes effect. This is expected to change the way banking is done in a major way. \"Over the next five years, I think the lines around fintech are going to become increasingly blurred. Customers won't differentiate between technology companies, banks or non-banks. We will see a more diverse market and more collaboration between product developers at small companies and tech teams in global banks as they create and distribute new products,\" said Oscar Berglund, CEO of Trustly. This only offers bigger opportunities for fintech companies and Sweden is looking to lead the way. Read more about startups around the world at Tech.Co ",

He's known for kicking up the dust and finding ways to get people fired up to shift the startup ecosystem into high gear. This time for the #StartupEverywhere series, he talks with me about his role in the ecosystem, operating an investment accelerator, the impact of educational institutions and challenges startups face. I refer to myself as the \"chief pot-stirrer.\" Seven years ago there was very little activity in our region, so my role at that time was to create activity through one-on-one meetings, events (such as pitch events and job fairs), and crowdsourced information blogs--really whatever it took. For the last six years I operated two investment accelerators, which collectively invested in 42 companies. I also am part of an informal group of community leaders who look for ways to increase both the scope and speed of our startup ecosystem's growth.  Raleigh-Durham is unique in that it has three large universities (University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Duke, North Carolina State) and a handful of smaller colleges that serve as excellent feeders for ideas, talent, capital, and awareness. Additionally, the Research Triangle Park (RTP) was created over 50 years ago and houses thousands of talented employees of IBM, Cisco, GSK, NetApp, and many others.  Those elements, combined with the low cost of living here, have really helped us grow. Read more about incubators around the country The number one feature that sets the Raleigh-Durham startup community apart is our inclusive nature. As startup community underdogs (as compared to New York City or Boston), we understand that we have to work harder and smarter than many other communities. North Carolina, specifically the Raleigh-Durham metro area, has experienced huge population growth and will continue to see a huge in-migration of talent--we are expected to add 1 million people by 2025. Every single person you speak to from our startup ecosystem will share that this region embraces them and empowers them from day one. In addition, our diversity statistics shatter national numbers. For example, the Startup Factory's founders were one-third female and one-third minority. These trends are also reflected in our co-working spaces. I'd say it's figuring out how to maintain all of the momentum built over the past seven years. This is not unlike the pressure that a growing company has as it matures. Our success has been built on a platform of #givefirst, which has has enabled us to do more things faster. But it gets harder to maintain that tight community as you grow. Our challenge will be in navigating future success with the same underdog intensity. The American Underground entrepreneur campus in Raleigh, NC. Our startup culture is unique and exciting and as such, it draws attention from policymakers at all levels. Most of the interactions are in the context of tours and hallway conversations. The Startup Factory has hosted a handful of state policymakers to share our observations. When I think about challenges and the next phase of startup community growth for Raleigh-Durham, I see an opportunity to bring awareness of the growing startup scene to policymakers, and even influence policy and behavior as a stretch goal. Tips on building a company culture at your startup There really is not any one thing but a bunch of good things that add up to the continued growth of the area's startup ecosystem. The first installment of Moogfest (a futuristic conference and music festival) was held in Durham to much acclaim. The American Underground entrepreneur campus (in coordination with Google for Entrepreneurs and Black Wall Street Homecoming) launched a week-long series of events where black founders from around the country received mentorship and extended their networks. The region continued to grow through HQ Raleigh's expansion of their footprint locally as well as into other geographies. Outside venture capital invested in local companies also continues to rise.

    "content": "At this point, denying that discrimination in tech is a problem is like insisting the world is flat: no one is buying it and you look stupid trying to justify your stance. Study after study has shown that there is not only a problem with diversity in tech, but that this problem is costing business owners dozens of innovative ideas, unique perspectives, and driven leaders. And according to one study, it's costing even more than that. Why diversity and inclusion is not a four letter word - interview A recent study conducted by Oakland non-profit Kapor Center for Social Impact, titled the Tech Leavers Study, has found that discrimination in the tech industry is responsible for an annual loss in the sector of about $16 billion. \"The costs of turnover due to unfairness in workplace culture are staggering,\" wrote the authors of the study. The study conducted a national survey of over 2,000 adults who left a job in a technology-related industry or function within the last three years in search of these answers. They found that nearly 40 percent of those who left cited unfairness and mistreatment as their primary reasons for leaving. Even still, $16 billion seems like an outrageously high number. But when you consider the fact that the study focused on current estimates of average costs for replacing professional employees, the numbers are sound. Each person who leaves a tech job will cost companies an average of $144,000 per employee for full replacement costs, including lost productivity, recruiting costs, and salary. And with 40 percent leaving for this reason, that $16 billion sounds about right.  It's easy for startup founders and business owners to write this off as a global problem that doesn't effect individual companies. However, the study did a great job of putting this staggeringly huge number in context for companies that might have a discrimination problem of their own: \"What would the cost look like for an individual company? If we assume a large tech company pays engineers an average salary of $100,000 and it employs 10,000 engineers, even with a lower turnover rate (5 percent) and turnover rate due to unfairness of 37 percent, that company alone would lose $27 million per year by allowing their workplace culture to drive talent out the door,\" wrote the authors of the study. As much as this study should effect the global diversity problem in tech, the likely response will be one of apathy. However, if one startup founder, business decision maker, or general manager takes the time to consider the benefits of diversity and the downfalls of discrimination, the world will be better for it. So be that startup founder, decision maker, or general manager; it could change someone's life. Read more about discrimination in tech here on Tech.Co ",

    "content": "The United States has roughly 21.8 million vets largely due to the lingering wars in the Middle East and far-reaching commitments around the globe. It is said that the difficulty that vets have transitioning is one of the toughest costs of war a nation has to bear. To get the vets back into the community and help them find lifesaving resources, Tech From Vets launched Vets 22, a mobile app that helps save veteran's lives by engaging with them and introducing them to little-known resources.  The app was named Vet 22 to commemorate the lives of an average of 22 vets who commit suicide in the United States on a daily basis. Studies show that the average Iraq or Afghan war veteran finds life much more difficult than those who served in the previous wars in Korea and Vietnam.  Vets 22 was launched by former NFL player Drayton Florence and decorated war veteran, Jeff Shuford. Florence played in the NFL for 11 years and had donned the jerseys of San Diego Chargers, Jacksonville Jaguars, Buffalo Bills, Detroit Lions and the Carolina Panthers, and is now the director of strategic partnerships at Tech From Vets. Shuford, on the other hand, had a heroic military career as he served in Operation Iraqi Freedom when he was just 19 and was later rewarded with a combat action badge. How Bunker Labs help veterans transition into startup world Shuford launched Tech From Vets with 20-year Navy veteran Lonnell McCall who serves as vice president of the award-winning tech company. Florence, living a post-NFL life was also willing to do something for the vets and together they built and launched the app. \"The primary objective of the Vets 22 app is to give veterans instant access to resources via a mobile and web application. The Vets 22 app provides veterans access to VA claims assistance, exercise facilities, employment opportunities, housing solutions, discounts, suicide prevention hotlines, members only chat and so much more,\" says Florence.  The app was first conceptualized when Florence asked a question to Tech From Vets Public Affairs officer Lieutenant Colonel, Rickey Pope, Army retired, regarding what is being done to help veterans transition into their life after tough years of service in and around the country.  Having the first-hand experience of serving 28 years in the Army, Pope replied that before being discharged from the military, each soldier attends a class on how best to reintegrate into society. But, after the discharge is complete, there are no more classes and the only option the vets have is to engage through their local VA. Florence being an experienced entrepreneur, immediately suggested that Tech From Vets develop an app to help vets adapt to civilian life more effectively. Read inspirational stories from veteranpreneurs The free Vets 22 app uses a simple, yet useful interface to help the veterans in their day-to-day functions. The most important of these functions is to stay united and help fellow vets who are suffering from PTSD, and other mental health issues. The platform provides life-saving resources to help veterans and their families in their hour of need and portals for establishing connections and helping the nation's unsung heroes in transitioning after war.  There are currently close to 34,000 veterans in Jacksonville alone and the military is expected to release more than 250,000 vets per year from its contracts thus creating a visible spike in the already high vet populations.

On Tuesday, bill LD 285 (Bill), \"An Act To Provide Funding for the Maine Coworking Development Fund\" passed the House last week in a party-line vote of 77 to 66. The Bill would provide a one-time infusion of $300,000 into the Maine Coworking Development Fund, which the Legislature created in 2015 to provide $100,000 a year to help develop coworking spaces around the state. \"Co-working spaces are critical pillars in our 21st Century economy,\" Rep. Fecteau told Maine Startups Insider after the Senate vote. \"They attract young people, entrepreneurs, and Maine's roughly 15,000 remote workers. Given our tourism economy, co-working spaces could very well mean our visitors spend an extra week stay in Bethel, Millinocket, or Portland.\" Democrats supported the Bill and Republicans opposed. At the time, Rep. Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford), the Bill's sponsor, was not hopeful that his bill would be able to pass the Senate, which is controlled by the Republicans, if it suffered another party-line vote. However, the Senate on Tuesday voted 22-13 in favor the Bill, with five Republicans crossing the aisle to support the bill: Asked in an email why he joined the Democrats in voting for the Bill, Sen. Saviello was succinct. \"The Bill supports small business startups,\" Saviello replied. Fecteau said he was thankful the Bill enjoyed bipartisan support in the Senate. The bill now goes to the appropriations table, where all bills that include a fiscal note are sent after being passed by the Legislature. Lawmakers on the Appropriations Committee are then tasked with finding ways to fund all the bills that have an attached cost. If they find a way to fund the Bill, it moves forward to final enactment. If lawmakers on the Appropriations Committee can't find a way to fund the Bill, then it dies on the table. The Maine Coworking Development Fund distributed its first $100,000 in February. The recipients were Fork Food Lab in Portland, which received $25,000; Open Bench Project in Portland, which received $12,500; Our Katahdin Properties in Millinocket, which received $25,000; Think Tank in Portland, which received $25,000; and The Gem in Bethel, which received $12,500.

Termed a \"social impact investing platform,\" the company is one of the first VC-backed Public Benefit Corporations and operates by allowing its users to select issues they care about (climate change, LGBTQ rights, you name it) and then builds a custom portfolio to yield returns in alignment with the customers' personal values. OpenInvest is grown 85 percent since its soft launch last September, so Tech.Co used their seed round announcement as an opportunity to have a chat with OpenInvest CEO and cofounder Conor Murray about just how OpenInvest's unique approach to socially responsible investing works. Read about startups raising capital in your city at Tech.Co Conor, alongside cofounder Phil Wei, was inspired to start their investing platform after starting with one question: How could they have the biggest positive impact on the society around them? \"We tried to figure out how we could have the biggest impact on society given our backgrounds / skill sets,\" Conor tells me. \"After a few months of exploring, and talking more with [Josh Levin, a sustainable finance leader from the world's largest environmental organization, WWF], who has a deep background in that space, we saw a massive gap between the things people care about and their investments.  \"We believe that if we allow people to align their investments with social and environmental issues, we can create a massive driver for positive change.\" OpenInvest helps investors influence the world using their values. But does the platform embody any values itself? Conor had three of them on hand: \"Our values are honesty, transparency and integrity,\" he explains. \"OpenInvest is empowering people to drive activism with their investments. We are a public benefit corporation, meaning we are a mission-driven company that values impact as well as adding value. OpenInvest is aligned with what it cares about: the public good.\" But could the platform's values ever be at odds with potential investors' values? \"For VC investors, we explicitly look for financial backers or partners that align with our mission,\" Conor says. \"In regards to our customers, it is possible given that both our issues and a client's are always evolving, but with a dedication to complete transparency, we will always be very clear and up-front about these.\" OpenInvest's goals are an interesting take on the \"philanthropreneur\" movement: They aim to balance social consciousness with a financial benefit. Their investors are certainly optimistic they'll succeed: \"OpenInvest is democratizing a movement that has already captured a significant percentage of institutional dollars, but in a much more powerful, granular, and approachable way,\" Alex Rampell, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz, mentions in their press release. Time will tell if OpenInvest can pull off this approach, but cofounders are definitely fulfilling their original goal: They're shooting for the biggest positive impact on the world around them.

Startups in particular are at risk, as their comparatively non-existent resources make them easy targets for thriving hackers. However, according to a recent study, entrepreneurs and business owners are ignoring the risks of cyber attacks and carrying on without the slightest bit of protection at their disposal. The study from Code42 titled CTRL-Z showed that a staggering number of business owners aren't taking any steps to protect their companies from cyber attacks. CEOs in particular are the problem, with 75 percent of them admitting that they use applications and programs that are not approved by their IT department, despite 91 percent acknowledging that their behaviors could be considered a security risk to their organization. These numbers, for lack of a better word, are bad, particularly considering the speed at which cybersecurity is evolving. \"We discovered that data protection in the enterprise is evolving, but perhaps not as rapidly as needed to keep up with the pace of change,\" wrote the authors of the study. \"The research showed that if data protection does not change, brands will face massive disruption and erosion of trust from customers and employees. This could lead to financial losses, even closure.\" If those numbers weren't enough to make your blood boil, these ones probably will: 51 percent of business decision makers have had a security breach within the last 18 months; 83 percent of business decision makers admit that their actions would be considered a security risk to their organizations; and 10 percent of information technology decision makers don't believe they have full visibility over corporate data. So why are CEOs, business decision makers, and IT professionals being so cavalier about cybersecurity? They're reasons, while ignoring basic security protocols in the face of financial loss, are noble. 80 percent of CEOs and 65 percent of business decision makers said they only use unauthorized applications and programs to ensure productivity, while 59 percent of CEOs and 52 percent of business makers do it because it simply makes life easier.  These reasons are admittedly hard to argue with. Secure programs take longer to load and cybersecurity measures waste precious hours of the day. As CEOs and business decision makers, they are in the business of getting work done. And without seeing a hacker in a black ski mask and burlap sack with a dollar sign printed on it, cyber attacks aren't going to be perceived as that much of a threat. However, cybersecurity is a lot like insurance: it's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. Cyber attacks are getting more sophisticated and detrimental every single day. And if you want to make sure your company doesn't end up in the Startup Graveyard because of a single hacker, you need to make some changes to your cybersecurity strategy. And listen to your IT employees! Sheesh! Read more about protecting your company here on Tech.Co  ",

    "content": "Unlike bar trivia, startup competitions are about more than just winning. While the prizes, the attention, and the bragging rights are certainly beneficial to any company looking to make it big, there are more than enough benefits to taking part in a startup competition that don't involve taking home the crown. And Tech.Co's Startup of the Year competition at our annual conference, Innovate! and Celebrate, is the perfect example of these kinds of added bonuses. The benefits of participating in the Startup of the Year competition are undeniable, particularly when you ask former contestants that have gone on to experience success without winning. And if you're curious about these benefits that aren't winning, take a look below: There's no denying that startup competitions are the best place to network. Not only are you surrounded by peers with innovative ideas that could change the world, you're also rubbing shoulders with some of the most influential entrepreneurs and investors on the scene in the form of judges, mentors, and speakers at the competition. Last year, notable minds like Jeff Clavier, Lo Toney, and Lisa Lambert were all in attendance. And trust us when we say that this year's competition is no different. \"The opportunity to network with founders from Silicon Valley is really unparalleled,\" said Garrett Moon, CEO and cofounder of CoSchedule. \"There was tons of energy and excitement during the entire event and working with other founders spurred a wealth of ideation and momentum beyond.\" While the Startup of the Year competition is one of the main focuses of our annual conference, it's important to remember that it's not the only focus. Startup founders, employees, and attendees will be privileged to one-on-one mentor sessions with some of the most innovative minds in attendance. From tech titans to serial entrepreneurs, you'll be able to get all the ideas you'll ever need from these quick sessions. Even if you don't win, the Startup of the Year competition helps entrepreneurs get noticed, through video coverage and Tech.Co articles, all while placing you in front of notable investors throughout the conference. Plus, there are plenty of opportunities to be had outside of the conference as well, as past contestants have been all too happy to share. \"The accolades and recognition were wonderful and very uplifting to the team, but the very best thing was the booth we received at CES in January,\" said Paul Droege, founder and CEO of SunPort. \"The fact it was free was nice but it had an amazing, high-traffic location which was awesome.\" Being an entrepreneur can be stressful, maddening, and downright unenjoyable at times. However, the Startup of the Year competition brings together like-minded individuals from across the world in an effort to spur innovation, develop startup support, and have a little fun. The conference is filled with engaging workshops and driven people that, when you take some time to relax, could help you wind down that high strung mentality that entrepreneurship has placed on you. If you think you have what it takes to be the Startup of the Year, you need to apply today. Remember, the 100 startups that are chosen will be invited to join us in San Francisco, CA for Innovate! and Celebrate 2017, and will be on their way to startup success in no time!

    "content": "Without the proper protection, a startup and their data are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks during their first 18 months. Further research reveals that 43 percent of attackers target startups and small businesses, while only 35 percent and 22 percent target large companies and medium-size enterprises respectively. With the platforms above, you can proactively begin to avert traffic-based attacks. Just be sure to implement other security measures that can protect you against other attack types. If cybersecurity isn't your list of priorities then you've already committed one of your first mistakes in business. Looking at the hacking incidents of 2016, and the global attack WannaCry, it's apparent that cyber criminals are getting more sophisticated and ruthless every year. A DDoS attack utilizes a large network of infected computers, also known as a \"botnet\", to flood the target website's servers and deny access to real users - thus, resulting to lost revenue. It may also lead to secondary damages such as lost data, high remediation costs, and a ruined brand reputation. To protect your startup from such attacks, below are 4 platforms to consider: The most straightforward way to protect against DDoS attacks is to leverage a comprehensive security platform like Cloudflare. It has everything you need to protect your startup from security threats, including but not limited to a web application firewall (WAF), a shared SSL certificate, and advanced DDoS protection. One of the downsides to using an all-in-one solution like Cloudflare is that it's not cheap. You do have the option to avail the free plan, but the level of protection you'll receive will only be adequate for personal blogs. At the very least, you'll need to look at their plan add-ons such as a dedicated SSL certificate and additional page rules. Incapsula is one of the most popular alternatives to Cloudflare when it comes to providing comprehensive security. It pretty much offers the same features like DDoS protection, a WAF, and page rules for a slightly higher price. This is mainly due to the real time dashboard that allows you to monitor traffic data and events in real-time. The scripting language for the rules editor, however, has a steep learning curve. But once you master it, you have complete flexibility on the traffic rules and filters you can incorporate on your site. Inxy is one of the few hosting services with a built-in CDN or Content Delivery Network. A CDN mitigates DDoS attacks by absorbing the bulk of data requests. This allows your site to maintain functional speeds should an attack break through Inxy's built-in DDoS protection features It's worth noting that to date Inxy also has one the cheapest CDN rates in the market - suitable for startups that need to make every dollar count. To recover from data losses caused by an attack, the platform also comes with a backup service as a failsafe. WordPress users have the advantage of free plugins when fulfilling their security needs. When it comes to DDoS protection, Wordfence is by far the most popular option. The plugin integrates directly with the WordPress dashboard, so it's very easy to setup and use. Wordfence is complete with powerful features that can protect your site from cyber-attacks. This includes a WAF, a threat defense feed, scheduled scans, country blocking, and even two-factor authentication. You can also take advantage of the Live Traffic view to track traffic data and hack attempts as they happen. The only disadvantage of Wordfence is that it's tied to the WordPress content management system. Without the proper protection, startups and their data are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks during their first 18 months. Further research reveals that 43 percent of attackers target startups and small businesses, while only 35 percent and 22 percent target large companies and medium-size enterprises respectively. With the platforms above, you can proactively begin to avert traffic-based attacks. Just be sure to implement other security measures that can protect you against other attack types.

    "content": "Productivity is the Sisyphean goal of all budding entrepreneurs. While startup founders and innovators are constantly in pursuit of improving their ability to get stuff done, there is always more work to do. Whether you're burning the midnight oil or researching office hacks during your lunch break, figuring out the best way to meet your goals is part of the entrepreneurial process. What you might not know is that wasting time could be your best path to success. According to Michael Guttridge, a business and coaching psychologist in England, the psychological importance of wasting time cannot be understated when it comes to productivity. While entrepreneurs typically subscribe to the \"sleep when you're dead\" model, study after study has shown that a little down time is not only good for your mental health, but also good for your working environment. \"There's an idea we must always be available, work all the time. It's hard to break out of that and go to the park,\" says Guttridge. \"Wasting time is about recharging your battery and de-cluttering.\" There's no denying that a little downtime can help productivity. A good night's sleep has been shown to make work easier. Hobbies are proven to expand the mind and improve productivity. Even the Shower Principle, made famous by Jack Donaghy in 30 Rock, proves that doing anything but work can improve your chances of success in the short term. Working yourself to death, while considered admirable in past years by suit-clad bosses and stress-driven managers, gets you nowhere. Work-life balance isn't just a perk that startups offer in hopes of attracting top talent. It's the most effective means of spurring quality work in a healthy way. After all, as Guttridge quipped: \"Even Victorian factories had some kind of rest breaks.\" Read more about increasing productivity in your office here on Tech.Co ",

    "content": "Running a company isn't all rainbows and roses. There are times that the weight of the world falls on your shoulders and emotional rollercoaster is such that you might feel like it's too much, but you keep going. Recently, the founders of all the Techstars companies currently in program were invited to participate in a personal growth and emotional self-exploration session with Jerry Colonna. In a previous Techstars alumni panel, one of the founders dubbed Jerry Colonna as \"the human onion, because he makes everyone cry.\" By his own admission, one of Jerry's claims to fame is that he made Jason Calicanis - entrepreneuer, angel investor, and notorious hardass - cry. Needless to say, I was intrigued... The room was configured into a semi-circle of chairs situated around a makeshift stage created from lines of tape on the carpet. When I arrived, I couldn't help but notice boxes of tissues strategically distributed around the room. Now I was nervous. As someone who cries at movies like Miracle and The Patriot , I'm just not sure I was mentally prepared to turn into a sobbing, snotty mess in front of a bunch of other startup founders. To be safe, I scooted a box of tissues closer. These foods will help you sleep better at night For three hours, Jerry walked us through a series of slides that were coupled with a few exercises, constantly checking in to ask how we were doing. At one of those interludes, he noticed one of the founders looking a little distraught. He put the agenda on hold to investigate. The rest of the room observed silently as Jerry dove deeper into what was going on with this founder. In a gesture that was more sincerity than showmanship, Jerry approached the founder and knelt down, just a couple inches from him. Jerry: \"Can I ask what's going on?\" Founder: \"I'm four years into my 'overnight success,' and -- I'm tired.\" My understanding of the day, my situation, and perhaps even myself changed over the course of those two sentences. With his simple admission, this founder summed up some of the most misunderstood aspects of starting a company. Namely, it's really, really hard. People often think that startups are all about ping-pong and kegerators, free coffee and snacks. That they are just some adult playground where we do trust falls and draw pictures on whiteboards until investors throw money at us. You've probably heard the adage that over 90 percent of companies fail, but that masks the humanity behind the stories. For every one of those startups that fail, there is someone who started that company from scratch, recruited others to join them, and asked them to pour their lives into their vision. And who also spent countless hours and expended blood, sweat, and tears to try to make it work. That same person now has to break the news to the team. He has to tell employees that trusted him with their livelihood that they no longer have a job. He has to explain to investors that the money they gave him is gone. He has to explain to his family and loved ones that the thing he has been working on so hard for the last however long no longer exists. He tried. He failed. He has to start over. The worst part? That failure could take years. The founder from the conversation above is far from failing. In fact, his might be the company best positioned for success of all the Techstars' companies in this class. But it's taken years of carrying the burden of the fears I've outlined above, and in that moment, you could see the weight of that burden in full force. I only just managed to choke back my own tears in reflecting on what he was going through, but then again, I'm pretty early in this journey. I've still got three more years before I'm at the same point in my quest for an \"overnight success\" of my own. I just hope I have the strength to make it that far.

    "content": "Competitive analysis is an essential element of a business plan, but unfortunately, many startups aren't ready to accept this fact. The result is in front of us -- 90 percent of them fail within the first 18 months. As a business owner, it's your job to handle this issue in an effective manner and forge ahead accordingly. If you wish to see your business touching new heights in today's highly-competitive world, then take every possible step to know your competitors and shoot ahead of them before things become hot and bothered. Many business owners consider competition the biggest hurdle in the market. They believe they could do much better if there was no one to compete with. This is not true at all. Competition, in fact, is healthy for the market augmentation and helps consumers in a significant manner. It pushes large businesses to improve their services for the sake of expansion and allows consumers to make better decisions. For small businesses or startups, however, it creates stumbling blocks which they can approach as a boon or bane. It entirely depends on the individual mindset as to how he perceives competition. Should you wish to fast-track your growth, then learn to handle competition effectively. As long as you compete with a publicly traded company, collecting information is very easy due to various legal implications. But if it's a private company, then you may need to walk the extra mile to get desired results. What you can do is follow the below-mentioned five ways and conduct a competitive analysis to outdo your competitors before it's too late.  Instead of using the latest tech-enabled tools and hire experts to collect information about your competitors. You could simply talk to their customer care executives and understand the pitch they use for selling. Lest your competitors have a strong offline presence, you can simply visit their stores and collect information about all the major products. It will help you figure out how their products can be further improved and launched in a revamped avatar. In addition to this, you can check their reviews, opinions, and suggestions about the products and what improvements they would want to see in them. Doing so will give you a primary idea of what lies ahead and how much you need to improvise to get an edge over others. The previous step is good to initiate the proceedings, but you cannot entirely depend on it to get desired results. That's where the role of credit and background reports becomes important. The moment you use them, you get a clear idea of how much efforts you need to put to outdo your competitors. There are many service providers in the market that can help you with company credit check. Go with the one that carries a solid track record and can live up to your expectations. They are golden options for many businesses in specific areas. All you need to do is visit your local chamber of commerce or any other government department that deals with the business registration process. There you can find business directories, containing information about all the businesses operating in that area in a hassle-free manner. Besides, you can also opt for a paid directory service in your area and check out who else is present in the same field that you're trying to explore.  Above mentioned tips are good enough for competitive analysis in the offline market, but since you're living in the information age, you need to cover the online market as well. Most businesses try to maintain a consistent online presence through websites, blogs, social media accounts, forums, etc. You could hire a social media expert for company search or spend some time yourself and check out how well they are performing. This will help you stretch your own limits and perform better once you hit the floor and kickstart business proceedings. Each country has its own economic census, which contains detailed information of all the businesses engaged in the production or distribution of goods & services in the online or offline market. For example, U.S. economic census can be accessed at www.census.gov/econ, while U.K. economic census is www.ons.gov.uk. Likewise, you can search for the economic census of any country and take a look at the lists of different businesses easily. It will give you a precise information about the number of registered businesses in any specific niche or market. Use this information to plan your growth strategy. There are many other ways through which you can do competitive analysis; however, the ones mentioned here are widely used by many millennial entrepreneurs and new-age startups. You can give them a shot to make better decisions and outdo your competitors over time. Read more tips on marketing at Tech.Co ",

    "content": "Any mompreneur will tell you there will be challenges to balancing the needs of the family with building a business, but the positives and benefits can outweigh it all during the journey. We asked two startup mompreneurs to shed light on challenges they've faced, what they do to balance it all and share advice that helped them along the way. Anyone can guess time management was going to be #1 on the list of challenges for any mompreneur, but it's so very true. Merav Kanat, founder and CEO of Gifthead and mother of a toddler, said that becoming a mother has forced her to be more organized with her time. \"You only have 24 hours a day, and starting a business is definitely like having another newborn in your life, with multiple needs you didn't handle before. The challenge is to learn fast and develop the right skills quickly to establish a normal routine. The next challenge is to keep your life balanced with a tight but well-organized calendar,\" Kanat said. Sometimes the business comes before the kids or the other way around. Either way it's a major transition to accommodate all the demands. Johanna Mikkola, cofounder of Wyncode Academy and mother of an infant, said it took time to get used to the balance of being a mompreneur. \"I worked until the day I went into labor so the transition from working to full-time baby mode took time to get comfortable with. I was accustomed to being very busy and moving quickly but having a baby slowed things down and kept me rooted at home,\" Mikkola said. \"While I was loving this new little man in my life, I felt a bit of cabin fever being stuck at home (1-3mo phase). The first few months can feel isolating particularly if you've been accustomed to a fast-paced environment as you're building a business.   \"Now that he is a little bit older, and has his own personality, it's hard not to want to cuddle with him all the time. It sounds cliche but it's hard to leave him in the mornings. [However,] the time apart makes the time together that much more special.\"  So how do these mompreneurs balance it all? Exercise is the most common outlet to relieve stress, but there are other methods that can help one's soul. Kanat said she intentionally carves out time with people who give her an inspirational boost. \"Every week I set a few 'inspirational meetings' over coffee with colleagues, friends, ex-bosses, other mompreneurs, or my smart partner at home. [These] fresh ideas and thoughts excite me, and usually save me a lot of time, that I can spend back with my family,\" Kanat said. Read about how to sleep better at night at Tech.Co Being a founder of a company and having children could both be considered a thankless job, but the joy of the journey outweighs anything in comparison. \"[If you get] the privilege to do something you love every day and make a business of it - you'll really enjoy the journey, and it's the highest level of self-fulfillment. [In addition,] you become a happier mom, and amazing role model for your kids. Many women I know aspire to reach this point but many of them get the courage to do that only after their first maternity leave,\" Kanat said. Doing everything yourself might give you the comfort that it's done your way, but as a mompreneur the endless to do list is going to catch up to you and effect your health if you don't ask for help. \"It's hard for me to ask for help to begin with but now that I am living it, accepting help is a game changer. Let people help you! Ask for help! [For your child,] having a system in place with in-laws or a great nanny will empower you to do great things at work and will make everything easier,\" Mikkola said. When it's time to switch hats and go into mom mode, Mikkola believes it's good to have a group of friends outside of work to talk through the day-to-day questions of raising a child. \"Find a local mom group. At every event or gathering I am always surprised at how much I enjoy speaking to other women who manage work and baby. It's fun, you get some 'mom time' and the discussions are both therapeutic and inspirational,\" Mikkola said. Read more advice from mompreneurs at Tech.Co ",

    "content": "Here's a common office scenario: you go into a brainstorming session and someone starts to whiteboard ideas. Things are going great, occasionally you erase and go over a section, and the meeting comes to an end. The meeting lead tells you to capture the info on the board. This leaves you with either taking a photo on your phone or writing it all down and transferring it to a computer. Super effective, right? Not so much. Now add in a few remote team members, they are either SOL, have to wait for the image at the end, and hopefully can visualize what's being said through audio queues or a crappy webcam. On top of this, most companies have built in whiteboards already, and aren't going to spring for a $1,000+ smartboard that some classrooms use. Kaptivo, a Kickstarter success story, has created a solution to each of these problems, and it's less than half the cost. Using a camera-based device installed over a whiteboard, it easily captures everything on the whiteboard and seen by anyone with a link to the platform. To see if the system lived up to the concept, we gave it a whirl for a month or so to see if it's worth the business expense.  Quite simply, the Kaptivo makes whiteboarding accessible to anyone, anywhere, as long as they have hardware and an internet connection. Using an existing installed whiteboard and the Kaptivo above it, anything written on the board will show up in near-real time on the web platform. The reason why we say near-real time is that there is a very purposeful delay. While the platform captures what is being written on the board, it discards hands or other objects in the capture field. After a few seconds of non-movement, Kaptivo detects that a written line is staying, and will then appear on your screen. You can see an example of how placing your hand on the whiteboard and not moving it will make it show up. It's simple and it's clever as hell.  Installing Kaptivo beats having to use a super expensive smart whiteboard with special whiteboard markers. Using your existing setup it makes it easier to upgrade your office, classroom, or really anywhere you might have an installed whiteboard. That does highlight a slight downside though, which is that this device only works on installed whiteboards rather than the mobile ones that are on stands. It's not a big deal, and I'm sure if you really, really wanted it to work it can be rigged up, but it's not designed for it. Find more gadgets that can help you become a cord cutter Being a startup and a first run piece of hardware, it's likely that the company will make future iterations to solve for this if there is a demand. The only other downside is the capture quality. It is by no means bad, and the default settings are a component of this, but from our example you can see the contrast is way too high. There are two reasons for this: whiteboard markers suck and as they start to run out of ink a higher contrast capture will allow the content to still be legible. The downside is that if someone has small writing, it may be a bit harder to read. With that said, it still works quite well, but leaves some room for improvement.  Kaptivo also does not currently offer any kind of cloud storage, so whatever is being captured must be downloaded in the session. However, they plan to offer a premium cloud solution later this year according to their marketing department. Either way, as long as you remember to download it that's really a non-issue. As for what Kaptivo captures, you can either download a PDF version that shows any changes and iterations made, or you can simply download the current screen. For those watching the web platform (up to 15 people), content is streamed and updated with only a minor delay. For an added bonus, any platform such as Google Hangouts that supports screen sharing can also be used to capture what is being seen, which extends how many people can see it or even used during a webinar. Overall we found the Kaptivo to be an incredibly useful addition to the office environment, especially with remote team members. The hardware also supports existing infrastructure and that makes it even more cost-effective. Kaptivo is designed with a simple, yet sleek look, and fits right in with most office environments. Where it really stands out is how it was clearly developed to be easy to install and use. Besides drilling the mounting bracket and control plate into a wall, the rest is literally a snap. You click the main camera hardware in place, then the control panel, and wire it all up. For the most part it's feasible to reduce the appearance of wires by running it alongside the actual whiteboard. It would be nice if the camera to control panel was wireless, but even then it would still need a power connection of some kind. Once the hardware is installed, the software component is just as easy. You connect to Kaptivo's WiFi network, go to the setup wizard, detect the edges of the whiteboard, and you're good to go. They even included a table topper with instructions so that anyone can quickly use the device. Best of all, there are no downloads or plugins needed to access and use it. Overall Kaptivo looks good, but where the design really shines is in the ease of use and setup process. Should you buy the Kaptivo? If you have standard whiteboards, absolutely. The cost alone makes the device intriguing, but by making whiteboarding more accessible to anyone from remote teams to clients, it's an easy yes. The only downside, which is likely to be solved in the future, is that Kaptivo must be used on installed whiteboards rather than the mobile ones on stands. Beyond that, the capture quality is good (has room for improvement), and is so easy to use that even your tech illiterate boss can use it. We give Kaptivo a 4.5 out of 5.

    "content": "HBO's Silicon Valley has been touted as one of the funniest shows on TV right now. However, Bay Area entrepreneurs and startup founders are quick to point out that the show is remarkably accurate when it comes its portrayal of the tech world. Founder disputes, tech pivots, and hostile takeovers are all integral parts of the series that were lifted from real life. But this time, real life is taking a page out of the Silicon Valley book. In last night's episode, one of the characters revealed an app that, while it was supposed to be the \"Shazam of food,\" turned out to simply be an app that could identified if something was or was not a hot dog. Well, apparently, life imitates art a lot more than you might think, as the \"Not Hotdog\" app can now be found in the app store. Yes, really.  While figuring out whether or not something is a hot dog should be reserved for your eyes and your eyes only, the technology in this app could prove helpful in developing a \"Shazam for Food\" in the future. After all, if it can detect hot dogs, who knows what potential lies within those lines of code! To make matters even more confusing, the actor who plays Jian-Yang, the creator of the app, appeared on Tech at Bloomberg to announce the launch of the undeniably real app to the world in true tech fashion. WATCH: @EmilyChangTV chats w/ Jian-Yang about his \"Not Hotdog\" app.  Download it today (really): https://t.co/7N6a1Asfge #SiliconValleyHBO pic.twitter.com/99TBhaiHYk -- Tech At Bloomberg (@TechAtBloomberg) May 15, 2017  In the golden age of television, it was only a matter of time before the tech community starting see the potential for innovative ideas. Was this just a marketing campaign to get the show more attention? Almost certainly. However, it does open the door for more innovators, entrepreneurs, and startup founders to think to themselves, \"Is a BatMobile a viable means of transportation and could I get it funded?\" Read more about new apps and startups here on Tech.Co Photo: Flickr / Keith Cooper ",

    "content": "Launchway Media is a digital agency specializing in data-driven marketing campaigns for global startups, with a record for helping technology startups, especially in Latin America, launch and grow their products or services on a global scale. They're also a three-woman operation: Nora Leary is the head of marketing, Katie Griffing is the head of operations, Caitlin Sanders is the creative director, and all three are co-founders. Launchway's unique location and business model -- the bilingual marketers operate out of Latin America and help startups navigate the area's business ecosystem -- give them an interesting startup story of their own. Here's the story of how the marketing team struck out on their own and what lessons they learned in the process. The three team members all hail from the United States originally, but have lived in Latin America for the past five years, an experience that has given them insider knowledge on the challenges faced by those in emerging markets. \"Our founding team met in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2013,\" Launchway tells me, \"and we decided to start the company in 2015 after working together for two years at another web development and marketing agency. We decided to use our connections and prior experiences in the U.S. to tap into the growing startup ecosystem in Latin America and help startups here. There are many entrepreneurs creating innovative products and services for the U.S. market that need native English speakers to help them market their ideas. As bilingual marketers with experience working in the LatAm tech industry, we have a particularly unique voice and perspective to offer companies in the region.\" Launchway knows what it takes to help their clients stand apart from other startups and get into a top-tier accelerator program: \"Most startups can't afford to hire a full-time marketer,\" they say. \"Not to mention, the entire interviewing and recruiting process can waste a great deal of the team's valuable time. By outsourcing marketing tasks to us, startups often get the same amount (or more) work done by an entire team of marketing experts for the same costs as hiring one person. Our clients have been through a variety of accelerator programs: 500 Startups Mountain View, Naranya Labs, NXTP Labs, Start-Up Chile, TechStars Austin, Venture Hive, and more, so we also offer accelerator application services to help startups edit and perfect their application, pitch video, and pitch decks so they can get into a top program.\" It is an interesting time to be a woman in tech working in Latin America, Launchway tells me. \"Technology here is a bit behind the U.S.,\" they explain, \"which means the region has time to fix the mistakes that the U.S. made about integrating women in the field. Hopefully, and perhaps by learning from what went wrong in the states, Latin America can do a better job of making sure women are treated equally in the industry. Since there is also more ground for female entrepreneurs to cover, the growing startup ecosystem in Latin America makes for an exciting environment full of possibilities. There are many business models that have already thrived in U.S. but have yet to catch on in Latin America, and that leaves many opportunities for those who are innovating, regardless of gender.\" ",

    "content": "A company that wants to turn Maine farmers' surplus into high-end locally sourced frozen food has won the sixth annual UMaine Business Challenge, held in Orono. Anita van Dam and Grace Burchard, both students at College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, took home 1st place for their company, [Re]Produce. The first-place finish comes with a $5,000 cash award, which van Dam said the pair will use to help launch the company in Portland this fall. (More on [Re]Produce below.) Five teams of college entrepreneurs competed in the finals of the UMaine Business Challenge, which, despite its name, is open to student entrepreneurs from any Maine college or university. This year, three teams were from UMaine, one was from Southern Maine Community College, and the [Re]Produce team is from College of the Atlantic. Second place, along with a $1,000 cash award, went to a group of three UMaine students--Bradley Shepherd, William McEnery, and Devin Shepherd--for their video game company, Boreal Games. Benjamin Koehler, a senior at UMaine studying mechanical engineering, won the Technology Award, which also comes with $5,000, for a product he's developed called the Comfort Appliance, which is able to draw heat off of a wood stove, and store it in a portable, insulated box that can then be carried to another room to provide warmth to an otherwise unheated space. Van Dam said [Re]Produce provides value in two directions: first, it provides farmers an additional revenue stream by purchasing, processing and freezing their excess and unmarketable produce, and second, it provides discerning consumers with year-round access to locally grown vegetables. \"By doing this, we increase access to local food while reducing (in-field) food waste,\" van Dam told Maine Startups Insider. The company is beyond the idea phase. Van Dam, a sophomore, and Burchard, a senior, are currently working on the business in the Diana Davis Spencer Hatchery Accelerator, a business incubator at College of the Atlantic. They have worked on their business plan and spent time speaking with farmers, consumers and retailers to get more information about what the market is demanding. They already have eyes on a facility in Portland where they hope to launch the business this fall. The plan, as of now, is to market towards millennials, van Dam said. \"Our niche market is millennials because they are more passionate about social and environmental issues and will use their food buying power to encourage change,\" she said. Van Dam and Burchard have also spoken with the team behind Northern Girl, the innovative, locally focused food processor in Aroostook County that announced it was ceasing operations in early March. \"They have given us valuable information that will help us make more strategic decisions,\" van Dam said. \"We admire Northern Girl for being the first local frozen produce business, and thank them for openly talking to us about potential problems that can arise from a business like ours.\" The post [Re]Produce wins UMaine Business Challenge appeared first on Maine Startups Insider.
