    "title": "The DeanBeat: GamesBeat Summit conversations on the Metaverse, AR's future, and Hollywood envy",
    "content": "We just hosted our third annual GamesBeat Summit at the Claremont Hotel in Berkeley, Calif. It was a beautiful place and a great backdrop for our talks about the inspiration cycle between science fiction, real-world technology, and games. We had 72 speakers and 250 attendees with endless stories to tell, but here's some of the beautiful threads that stood out for me.Above: Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, wants the Metaverse to happen.We kicked off the conference with Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games. I asked him where we were in our ability to create the Metaverse, the immersive virtual world envisioned by sci-fi novelist Neal Stephenson in Snow Crash. Sweeney said that social VR experiences like Altspace VR and Facebook's social VR platforms are the beginning of the Metaverse, but we still need technologies like \"deep input,\" or taking videos of people's faces (and capturing their emotions) and transporting that into a virtual environment.He said the tech can work in commercial hardware that costs tens of thousands of dollars, but he said it might just be about two VR hardware  generations, or as little as three years, before we will have the inward and outward facing cameras to capture our expressions, image recognition, and face recognition technology to make the experience much more immersive.Artificial intelligence and believable human graphics will contribute to the Metaverse's realism, and that will open a whole new genre of games about making human connections rather than killing monsters. Sweeney also thinks it will also be a few short years before we can make augmented reality glasses with 8K resolution per eye, where it animations will fully blend with reality.Sweeney sees massive amounts of investment happening in China and South Korea toward VR, and that could very well lead to making the Metaverse. But Sweeney is worried not only about our ability to keep the Windows PC open, but also about the ability to keep the Metaverse from being taken over by corporate interests with proprietary technologies.\"That's the central question for the industry, and something I think about a lot,\" Sweeney said. \"The web was open because it was built on standards. It's the opposite of Twitter and Facebook, which are locked down proprietary APIs and services controlled by companies. If we build the Metaverse based on top of protocols and all the major players in the industry are committed, we can avoid any one company taking control and having a monopoly over not just commerce. That's bad enough, but a monopoly over our private data.\"Above: Dean Takahashi (left), Ralph Osterhout, John Underkoffler, and John Hanke at GamesBeat Summit.I like how Sweeney thinks ahead and thinks things through. That's how I also felt about our panel on the future of augmented reality, which included speakers Pokemon Go (the first mass market AR app?) co-creator John Hanke of Niantic Labs; Minority Report science adviser and Oblong Industries CEO John Underkoffler; and AR glasses maker and Osterhout Design Group CEO Ralph Osterhout.All three of them said they were die-hard sci-fi fans. They represented applications, user interface, and hardware perspectives on AR. I asked them if it was hard to create AR today -- with bulky hardware and flawed software -- when they have such visions of the perfect state of AR or VR in their minds.Hanke said, \"It's great to have those visions of what it can be to carry us through those periods of when it is not quite there. Hollywood gave us \"Hal\" in [2001: A Space Odyssey] in the 1970s and we got the TRS-80. It wasn't quite Hal, and it took us another 30-plus years to get to what Hollywood promised us. It's going to get better. It's going to get there. Every new consumer electronics technology has sucked for the first five years on the market. VR is going through that. AR is going through that. We are all going to wear smart glasses on our faces. I have no doubt about that.\"\"Virtually every person I've met [wants a Star Trek] Holodeck,\" Osterhout said. \"The Holodeck that I see going forward is that where I look anywhere I choose to and [can see things coming out of the sidewalk], and the capability is here.\"Underkoffler said, \"We do have a vocabulary problem of what is VR and AR. Sometimes the hardware is a limitation. Sometimes the experience takes an important leap,\" like Pokemon Go did using existing smartphone technology. Hanke pointed to Nintendo, which has always made great gameplay experiences using hardware that could be made from commodity parts, with a lot of constraints.It may take a while to get to a pair of $200 AR glasses that do everything you want them to do.Osterhout said, \"[The tech] exists. But there's no such thing as a free lunch. You don't get to jam in another screen from a high-end smartphone into a tiny device and say, 'I want that son-of-a-bitch for free!' Everybody wants to have a Ferrari. But the sheer fact of the matter is if you're driving a Prius, you're not gonna be able to do everything that the Ferrari can do.\"I asked Hanke to speculate about what Pokemon Go 10 would look like.\"Well, I think those [pocket] monsters are gonna feel really real to you. I think they're gonna be with you,\" said Hanke. \"I think you're gonna be friends with them. Your kids are gonna have them in the house and they're gonna be like pets. ... It'll be a fun journey getting there.\"Above: Owen Mahoney, CEO of Nexon, at GamesBeat Summit 2017.Part of the premise of our theme was that industries can learn from each other. But not everybody was on board with that part of our theme, which suggested that you can really learn something from other industries. But that's OK, because diversity of viewpoints is a healthy thing. We all need our Klingons, our speaker suggested.Owen Mahoney, CEO of Nexon, was wedged in between virtual reality speakers like Sweeney, Kim Pallister, and Austin Grossman and Gary Whitta of Hollywood on the other. Mahoney let us know that he didn't think VR was worth spending a lot of money on yet, and he also said that admiring Hollywood could be the wrong thing to do for game developers.\"Hollywood is based on a linear form of entertainment, where you write a story, do principal photography, and do preproduction because that photography is so expensive, and then you do post production,\" said Mahoney. \"The game industry is nothing like that, and yet we use the movie vocabulary. There's no producer in the game industry that does the same thing as a movie producer. We use the nomenclature of the movie industry, but games that move the industry forward are some planning, some coding, and some testing. Then you find out what is broken. That's a loop of iteration on how you make a great game.\"Games are systems that set up decisions for the player, and the player creates the story and the ending from their own point of view, Mahoney said. With such different businesses, Mahoney thinks that Hollywood envy is wrong. After all, Nexon's Dungeon Fighter game has generated more than $8 billion in revenues in a decade, compared to $7.5 billion for Star Wars movies at the box office.\"I find games to be the most interesting form of art,\" Mahoney said. \"If we look for inspiration, we should look at how interesting systems and decisions are. If we focus on that, instead of whatever is coming out from Hollywood this month, we would have much healthier game industry.\"Above: Gary Whitta (left) and Jamil Moledina at GamesBeat Summit.Even Gary Whitta, the screenwriter for the blockbuster film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, said in an interview with Jamil Moledina of Google that games have carried the flag of creativity. He noted that after George Lucas finished his first six films, he stopped doing a lot with that universe. And games had to carry Star Wars forward for many years, keeping it alive until Disney came along and acquired Lucasfilm.\"Star Wars was in a wilderness, and there was a pretty long time where video games were at the vanguard of what Star Wars was,\" Whitta said. \"Video games carried that burden and kept Stars Wars alive in our imaginations for a very long time.\"Whitta grew up wanting to escape, and he didn't care if films or games or novels or comic books were different.\"I scratched an itch, and I found that video games scratched the itch better than most because they invited me in,\" he said. \"You talk about immersion. When the lights go down in a game, you cross into that plane in your mind in a much more real way. It was a more effective way to escape than almost any other medium where science fiction could exist.\"Whitta said he appreciates indie games and the ability to experiment more than Triple-A games, which have become conservative akin to major Hollywood releases.Above: Dean Takahashi (left), Michael Condrey, and Glen Schofield at GamesBeat Summit.The conference wasn't just about science fiction. Our larger theme was about inspiring creativity. And we heard a very inspirational, passionate presentation of Call of Duty creators Michael Condrey and Glen Schofield of Sledgehammer Games. They're tasked with being creative at making a new version of a game that has had 15 installments. And they took the franchise back to its roots in World War II and figured out how they could tell a much more emotional story and riveting experience with modern game technology.Sledgehammer took a huge turn away from the future, with its Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare sci-fi title, and went in a very different direction with the Second World War. They traveled the battlegrounds of Europe to get the research they needed to make an authentic World War II experience. And they made it happen because both of the founders were aligned with their passion to take Call of Duty back into the past. They bristle at the notion that Call of Duty games can't be creative.\"This is a deep, deep dive into what did happen,\" Schofield said. \"I'm an artist. My whole life. I paint. I draw. I have paint on my hands now. This is art. The story of the characters is ours. Creatively, it is like saying to [filmmaker Steven Spielberg] Saving Private Ryan wasn't creative because it was just a war movie.\"Above: Flamethrower in Call of Duty: WWIICondrey said, \"I look at franchises that are beloved throughout time. There are inflection points where new creative visions come in. The Dark Knight was a great moment in Batman history. Three years is a long time to devote to anything. No one wants to put three years of their lives on hold for game that is not creative.\"All of the research and dedication has made the game more authentic, and given the creators more respect for the sacrifice of the heroes of the war. And they came to respect the diversity of those who did the fighting.\"It was a World War. Every person, every country was touched by it. There wasn't any group that was spared by it. In Paris, you have the French Resistance, and many were made up of women. In the U.S., the African American troops were indispensable. We don't hide the racism. One of the guys in the platoon is Jewish,\" Schofield said. \"We're just trying to tell the truth.\"\"I remember this emotional journey I went on,\" Condrey said. \"Ten years ago, all the heroes were alive and they could be interviewed. We started this journey saying we want to tell this story because we couldn't let this drift from memory and make sure it never happens again. And we also realized that the people who were fighting for our freedom were no longer able to tell it themselves. That whole crew is no longer around. These common men and women who did these uncommon things can't tell the stories for themselves.\"Schofield said, \"It's really personal for most of us on the team. My grandfather lost his leg and got a Purple Heart. He would tell these stories. And my dad died during this game and we named the main character after him. In the end, we've all gotten respect and listening to their stories. We're trying to get everything right.\"I teared up a number of times during these talks about passion and creativity, and that made it more universal to me than just sci-fi. I've got many more talks to summarize and comment upon, but this will do for today. I was inspired by the imaginations of these speakers and where they ran with our theme, and I'm so happy that they chose GamesBeat Summit as a place to share their wisdom. Thanks to all who spoke and those who came or watched the streams. We'll have videos of these talks soon.",

    "title": "How China's meshing ride-sharing data with smart traffic lights to ease road congestion",
    "content": "Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing is lending its data to authorities as part of a new initiative to ease traffic congestion.Earlier this year, Didi partnered with the traffic police department of Jinan, the capital of Eastern China's Shandong province, which claims a population of more than 7 million. Jingshi Road is one of the most heavily congested thoroughfares in the city, and in March, as part of a trial to help get cars moving more quickly, the city installed smart traffic signals. These use sensors embedded on the road to help sync the traffic lights in accordance with the shifting volume of vehicles.However, feeding into this is a vast swathe of real-time road data provided by Didi, which analyzes its gargantuan army of drivers to see where traffic is moving and where it is likely to become congested. This helps inform the traffic signal cycles so the gaps between light changes are tweaked to cater to shifting patterns of vehicle movement.Above: Smart traffic signals positioned at an intersection on Jingshi RoadAccording to data provided by Didi, delays caused by congestion during rush hour dropped nearly 11 percent. As a result of this initial trial, authorities are now working on installing more smart traffic signal systems throughout the city.Didi Chuxing was formed in 2015 following a merger between local rivals Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache. Similar to Uber, Didi Chuxing offers smartphone-based car services, such as carpooling, taxis, and premium cars with drivers. Didi is the clear market leader in China, a fact that led Uber to merge its Chinese operations with Didi in a $30 billion deal last year.As part of its push to become a global player, Didi last week announced a whopping $5.5 billion funding round.However, China remains Didi's primary focus for now, and at the end of April the company revealed a new program to work with city authorities to \"resolve deteriorating traffic problems\" by offering up a new traffic data platform, called Didi Traffic. This is currently being used by regulators in Shenzhen, Jinan, and Wuhan.A number of other big data initiatives have sprung up from e-taxi firms elsewhere in the world. Uber has previously partnered with cities such as Boston for projects that involve analyzing trip-level data, including date and time, pickup/drop-off locations, distance traveled, and duration. This data helps establish traffic patterns and informs decisions around road improvements and parking zones, among other infrastructure projects.Elsewhere, GPS data derived from a number of e-taxi platforms is being used to improve road conditions in developing countries. Last April, the Open Traffic pilot program launched in the Philippines to show how real-time data can improve traffic and road conditions, with the World Bank backing a new open-source platform that used anonymized GPS data from thousands of Grab drivers to establish congestion patterns and travel times. The program was later opened to include other e-taxi companies, including Easy Taxi and Le Taxi, which collectively operate across dozens of markets, and it was extended into new countries, including Brazil, Malaysia, and Colombia.Didi says that it clocks around 20 million ride requests each day, processing around 2,000 terabytes of data as result. That's a colossal amount of information, and it's proving to be a useful byproduct of the company's ride-sharing service.Bike-sharing platforms have also risen to prominence in China as a consequence of heavy traffic. Back in March, bike-sharing startup Ofo raised $450 million, with Didi joining the funding frenzy, while competitor Mobike struck a deal with Tencent to bring bike sharing to WeChat users in China.",

    "title": "Bloomreach unveils its AI-powered DXP to deliver personalization at scale",
    "content": "Personalization is still high on the marketer's wish-list as brands aim to increase engagement, conversion, and relevance.Today, at its Connect NYC customer summit, Bloomreach -- the personalized digital experiences company -- has announced what the company claims is the market's first open and intelligent digital experience platform (DXP) that is designed to drive one-to-one personalized experiences across the entire customer journey.Using artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver real-time personalization at scale across all customer touch points, Bloomreach leverages its acquisition of Hippo for this platform and includes a full analytics suite to help marketers manage business outcomes.So how is this solution different from that announced when Bloomreach originally acquired Hippo?\"When Bloomreach acquired Hippo, we essentially had a core artificial intelligence engine on the Bloomreach side, and a core web content management system with a set of rules -- and segment-driven personalization capabilities -- but not a connection between the two,\" Kevin Cochrane, CMO at Bloomreach, told VentureBeat. \"In the past six months since we completed the acquisition, Bloomreach has been integrating the two technologies into a single digital experience platform so that a central AI can determine the personalized content and/or products that every digital visitor sees wherever they encounter a brand.\"That combination of elements is what helps Bloomreach achieve high levels of personalization.\"With combined intelligence and CMS, Bloomreach technology isn't just selecting what a customer sees,\" Cochrane said. \"It's also providing the repository to hold the content, the delivery tier to display the content on any digital touch point, and it allows for digital marketers to easily spin up new digital experiences based on customer behavior and intent data.\"While AI is helping power the solution, it is also controllable and can be pared back depending on the marketer's requirements.\"You can choose to have the AI fully automate the personalized experience -- choosing what content is presented on each channel,\" Cochrane said, \"You can dial the AI down to automate personalization on part of the experience and rely on segmentation or rules-driven approaches for others. You can let the AI tell you what to do based on the DXP's Insights application that mines customer behavior and performance data to figure out how to best adjust the experience to maximize business objectives. Or the AI within the DXP can do all of it.\"Of course, there is still the problem that most marketers want to personalize content at the very point in the journey when we know the least about the customer -- at the top of the funnel.\"The primary challenge of personalizing at scale at the top of the funnel is the cold-start problem, or knowing what to provide as an experience for a customer when you know nothing about them,\" Cochrane said. \"If you fail to provide a good initial experience, you could end up disappointing the customer, tarnishing your brand, and potentially losing the customer entirely.\"Bloomreach is trying to address that issue using some unique and exciting techniques.\"Customers who use BloomReach can leverage the intelligence of web-wide language understanding, as well as our breadth of algorithms that address everything from relevance to revenue optimization,\" Cochrane said. \"For instance, if a customer has come to an ecommerce site for the first time and searches on a new term that hasn't yet been searched, they could receive an irrelevant result. With BloomReach, through understanding language in our deep synonym base, we can ensure that the customer received a relevant set of results based not on having seen that search term on the retailer's site, but by seeing language and it's context across web-wide data.\"That extends to cross-device personalization to ensure the experience continues regardless of whether the consumer is viewing the site on a laptop or a smartphone.\"When web visitors are anonymous they often lose the context of their journey when they switch devices,\" Cochrane said. \"BloomReach has addressed this with unauthenticated cross-device personalization that uses behavioral assessment to link users across devices, like a laptop and a cell phone, to maintain their customer context even without logging in.\"Comprised of three distinct modules -- Bloomreach Personalization, Bloomreach Experience, and Bloomreach Organic -- Bloomreach DXP serves as an experience platform wherein data and algorithms determine every visitor's intent and either return the most relevant experience or inform business objectives.",

    "content": "With Apple's cash pile reaching into the stratosphere, people who buy and sell companies for a living think they know just how Apple should use that money.Any guesses? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?Okay, the answer is...use it to buy some companies!Thus far, Apple's acquisition strategy has been pretty subdued, except for spending $3 billion on Beats a couple of years back. Otherwise, investment bankers have been pretty bummed out that the Kings of Cupertino have not gone on an acquisition bender.Still, Apple just reported that it now has $250 billion sitting in a bank, most of it overseas, of course. But if talk of a repatriation holiday comes true, and Apple brings some of those bucks home...A banker can dream, can't they?Imaging how such an event would play out, Citigroup analysts drew up a list of odds-on favorites for an Apple purchase. Excerpts from the note that were published online by The Fly say the following list was generated by Citigroup analysts in a note entitled: \"Addressing the Problem of Too Much Cash.\" (Because is there anything worse than having too much cash?)At the top of the list: Netflix, with a 40 percent probability of being acquired by Apple. Disney was next, at 25 percent. The other five were at 10 percent or lower:Personally, I would put the odds at all of these at somewhere around zero. Were Apple to attempt to swallow companies of these size and scale, it would likely lose control over its more precious asset: its culture. Integration in any of these cases would likely be a nightmare and a huge distraction.Further, it would be a tacit admission that Apple's core businesses have run their course.Still, it's fun to speculate over the drama-fueled potential of Elon Musk learning to submit to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Or Netflix CEO Reed Hastings learning to accept being told what to do and when to do it.Nah, doubtful.",

    "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk thinks he can make his company as valuable as Apple -- by \"going at the machine that makes the machine.\"MarketWatch reports that three Tesla manufacturing facilities across the U.S. will soon start trying out the company's advanced robotics machinery and software to crank out the Model 3 car, its batteries and solar panels made under Musk's new SolarCity merger. Another Tesla factory in California, which is closed for renovations, used to produce about 100,000 vehicles per year. When it reopens with the upgraded machine-making machinery, Musk believes it could be churning out five times that many by the end 2018.\"I think this is just going to be a very difficult thing for other manufacturers to copy,\" Musk said. \"I don't know what to do if I were in their position.\"Apple manufactures much of its products abroad through contacted services, which Musk thinks is where his company might find its edge through mastery of automation. Tesla also uses contract manufacturing for some of its parts, however, while both companies offer similar maintenance services through walk-in locations and remote digital updates.\"If we're able to maintain a 50% growth rate for 10 years and achieve 10% profitability number and have a 20 P/E, our market cap would be basically the same as Apple's is today,\" Musk said in 2015. \"Now, that's going to require a bit--on the order of $700 [billion].

    "title": "French fear Putin and Trump followers are using 4chan to disrupt presidential election",
    "content": "During a brawling presidential debate this week, far-right candidate Marine Le Pen raised an issue against centrist rival Emmanuel Macron that has spiraled into accusations regarding Russian hackers and the notorious 4chan website.The issue concerned the long-whispered rumored that Macron, a former investment banker and Economic Minister, had opened an offshore bank account in the Bahamas to dodge taxes. He has denied this previously, and there has been no proof that would contradict him.Still, the issue has lingered around the margins because it speaks to attempts by supporters of Le Pen's populism to paint Macron as an out-of-touch elitist.The presidential debate on Wednesday grew heated as the moderators lost control, with both candidates tearing into each other just a few days before the final vote on Sunday. At one point, Le Pen retorted: \"Pay attention to what you say, Mr. Macron. I hope we will not learn that you had an offshore account in the Bahamas.\"The timing, and the mention of the Bahamas specifically, came just a few hours after an anonymous 4chan user posted screen shots of documents supposed to prove that Macron had set up a company in the Bahamas to avoid taxes.\"The first doc is the incorporation of a shell company in Nevis, a country that doesn't keep ownership records of corporations,\" the user wrote. \"The second is proof of a banking relationship with a bank involved in tax evasion in the Cayman Islands. People have known for a while that Macron underreported his income and assets to the government, but nobody knew where it was stored. Here's where his money is stored. See what you can do with this, anon. Let's get grinding. If we can get #MacronCacheCash trending in France for the debates tonight, it might discourage French voters from voting Macron.\"Macron's campaign issued a statement later in the evening saying the documents were clearly not real and that the attempt to spread information was \"fake news\" intended to influence voters. Moreover, the campaign accused followers of Russian president Vladimir Putin and U.S. president Donald Trump of being behind the forgeries.\"Here is how a fake news makes its way in a few hours to the heart of the French presidential campaign,\" said the statement of Macron's En Marche! campaign.On Thursday, French media reported that Macron's campaign had filed an official complaint and that a French prosecutor had launched an investigation. In a subsequent radio interview, Le Pen insisted she had not accused Macron but rather had simply asked a question about the issue.The issue once again stoked fear about the impact of \"fake news\" and attempts by outside groups to sway voters.Learning a lesson from the U.S. presidential election, a number of French media figures have joined together with Google and Facebook to develop Crosscheck, a project to identify and weed out fake news pertaining to the election. And Facebook said it has cracked down on 30,000 fake accounts during the French election season.With two days to go before the French return to the ballot box, Macron retains a comfortable lead in most polls and is widely expected to win. However, some uncertainty remains because an unusually large number of French voters have said they plan to abstain, particularly those who had supported more left-wing candidates.",

    "content": "Slack, the company behind the popular business-focused team chat app, has opened its first U.K. office, its second in Europe.Slack opened its first office outside of North America in Dublin back in 2015 and recently moved to a new, bigger base in the Irish capital. As its official European headquarters, the Dublin office currently houses 70 staff, though this is expected to rise to 180 by the end of the year.Located in central London (where else?), Slack's new hub will initially house just five employees, but the company expects to grow the U.K. team up to 400 percent by the end of 2017, with a specific focus on sales. Though London is playing second fiddle to Dublin from a European presence perspective, the U.K. capital actually represents Slack's most active city in Europe in terms of users and is in the company's top five globally.\"We've seen terrific growth outside of the U.S., particularly in Europe,\" explained Johann Butting, Slack's head of EMEA sales. \"Slack usage in the U.K. has doubled over the past year. The decision to open a London office and establish a larger Slack presence here was a simple one, driven by customer demand and our priorities both in the short and longer-term.\"Founded out of San Francisco in 2009, Slack has become a major force in the team communications realm and has raised north of $500 million. Though the company has blazed a trail in the business productivity app space, heightened competition from the likes of Microsoft, which launched a competing product last year, led Slack to take out a full-page ad in the New York Times and has caused some to question Slack's longer-term prospects.For now, though, Slack is continuing to ramp up its global credentials, and the company now claims hubs in its native San Francisco, Dublin, New York, Melbourne, Vancouver, and London.\"In London, we're super excited to be hiring talented people as we grow, to build meaningful partnerships and continue to help make people's working lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive,\" added Butting. \"The city is home to a highly skilled talent pool of people and a vibrant business community, which will only help us as we continue to expand across the region.\"Today's news comes just a few days after Slack revealed it was getting into the conference business with the launch of Frontiers, an industry event centered around the future of work.",

    "content": "(Reuters) -- Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media.The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided \"material support\" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino.\"For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,\" family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\"Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,\" the complaint said.Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon.Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others.Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre.Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police.In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit.Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users.

    "title": "PC Gaming Weekly: Heroes of the Storm's enters the reboot frontier",
    "content": "Heroes of the Storm could be facing a crucial point in its life. Blizzard Entertainment gave its multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) a 2.0 reboot last week, and it touted a big giveaway of heroes. The studio makes money from selling characters like Arthas the Lich King (one of Warcraft's most important people), along with offering skins, loot chests, and other goodies. So handing out heroes to bring people back to the game is a significant step for Blizzard.So far (and speaking just from my own observations here), we're seeing more people playing and talking about the competitor to League of Legends and Dota 2. The chatter has increased on Twitter, and more streams and videos are appearing on Twitch and YouTube.But from what we're seeing, it's still the same, player-friendly take on the MOBA -- just with some free goodies. I logged in and played a bit to, living up to my long-held nickname of \"Uther the Suckbringer\" as I struggled with Heroes. I'm sure other people find it fun, but it's just not my jam.And that's OK. What is interesting here is if the uptick of the chatter we're seeing from people online corresponds with an influx of returning and new players to Heroes of the Storm 2.0. In the competitive free-to-play market, giving away goodies is important in retaining players.But Blizzard is facing an even bigger question -- will it have to give out more loot to keep any of these new players engaged a month or so down the line?--Jason Wilson, GamesBeat managing editorWatch PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds spanks Team GamesBeat.How the game industry tackles diversity and personal failureA diverse workforce is meaningless if you don't use their perspectives to shape and enhance your games.

The developer  has made a big to-do about Heroes of the Storm 2.0, effectively relaunching its free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) for PC.

If you like those game types, they're here in Master x Master.

In another world, Etienne might still be working for TSM or Crunchyroll. But that spring, Etienne was offered a rare opportunity to purchase his own League of Legends team, Quantic Gaming.

We know better than anyone how to gather a group of tanks, healers and DPSers in the noble name of taking down a boss so big that alone we'd struggle to tickle it. However, the most interesting thing to happen to raiding in recent years didn't happen on PC. Destiny was only released on console, but it managed to fuse complex raid mechanics, surprisingly rich lore, and Bungie's usual buttery smooth FPS gunplay to create, well, something new. Over the course of three years, Destiny has delivered four raids, each with its own unique flavor and multiple bosses featuring fiendishly opaque challenges to overcome.

    "title": "Our favorite Star Wars games that no one else likes",
    "content": "All right, already. We all know that Knights of the Old Republic is great.Today, May the Fourth, is Star Wars today. Many publications will be telling you about the best Star Wars games of all times. You'll hear about the heavy-hitters, like Knights of the Old Republic, TIE Fighter, and Republic Commando.But we've seen a lot of Star Wars games over the decades. Sure, not all of them are fantastic, but even a flawed digital adventure in a galaxy far, far away can leave us with precious memories. That's why a couple of us decided to highlight our favorite Star Wars games that you're unlikely to hear anyone else talk about on May the Fourth.Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith for the Nintendo DSAbove: Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.We have a lot of Star Wars games, but not many of them actually launched as promotional tools along with a movie. And history has shown us that rushing a game to launch with a film isn't exactly a recipe for quality.So you wouldn't have much hope for the Revenge of the Sith game, let alone for DS. The home console versions for PlayStation 2 and Xbox sport fancy 3D graphics, but the portable Revenge of the Sith games for Game Boy Advance and the DS has 2D, sprite-based graphics. Basically, it looks like a Super Nintendo game.Revenge of the Sith for portables is a sidescrolling beat-em-up, like the Final Fight or Streets of Rage series. You play as either Obi Wan or Anakin and fight your way through droids and bosses in a simplified retelling of the movie's (bad) story. It is simple. It is short. But it's fun! And it looks great. The animations are fluid, and it uses all of the classic Star Wars music. Sometimes, you just want a game where you can spend a little time relentlessly whacking things with a lightsaber.And the DS version is superior to the GBA one. It features 3D space battles, which was an impressive feat for a portable system back in 2005. You can even play dogfights with your friends!I easily had more fun playing this game than actually watching Revenge of the Sith.Star Wars: Bounty Hunter for the Nintendo GameCubeI still find it difficult to believe that anything good at all came out of Revenge of the Sith, which is easily the most miserable Star Wars movie. But I shouldn't be too skeptical of Mike's pick because mine is from the Attack of the Clones era.Star Wars: Bounty Hunter puts you in the Mandalorian boots of papa Fett, Boba Fett's father Jango. And instead of forcing you into a cheap shooter or platformer, developer LucasArts instead tried to replicate Jango Fett's job. It was up to you to chase down bounties. To accomplish this, you had to explore alien worlds, use Jango Fett's tools, and get into gun fights.Above: Something fun is happening somewhere in this blurry mess.And sure, the game is fairly linear, but it has a nice illusion of freedom. A big part of that is that you have a scanner, and you could potentially come across a random, non-story bounty at any moment. And catching them and turning them in for credits is simple, but it's also satisfying.Disney recently re-released Bounty Hunter on PS4, and I think it still holds up visually. A lot of the textures are muddy and brown, but there's still something living about the animation of Jango using his blow torch to knock down a sewer grate. And the cutscenes, like when Jango Fett walks into a cantina to capture a bounty, have a rather cinematic quality about them.With a million Star Wars games out there, I can understand you not wanting to return to one from the Prequels, but I think Bounty Hunter stands out even if it didn't have the license. It has fun worlds to explore, and lots of interesting bounties to disintegrate.",

    "title": "Facebook shuts down its Oculus Story Studio team",
    "content": "Facebook is getting out of the narrative-based VR experience business.Oculus VR content boss Jason Rubin revealed today that the company is closing its internal Oculus Story Studio, which is the division that worked on non-interactive 360-degree short films for the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR headsets. Story Studio is likely best known for the Henry short that tells the story of a spiky hedgehog that likes to hug people despite this prickly parts. Now, instead of building that kind of content itself, Oculus and parent company Facebook will look externally for similar projects.\"Now that a large community of filmmakers and developers are committed to the narrative VR art form, we're going to focus on funding and supporting their content,\" Rubin wrote in his blog post. \"This helps us turn our internal research, development, and attention towards exciting but unsolved problems in AR and VR hardware and software.\"Rubin went on to say that Oculus and Facebook are \"committed to growing the VR film and creative content ecosystem\" even if it's not participating in that venture first-hand. Oculus is not backing away from trying to pay for VR content, though. Rubin pointed out that it will continue to put its money into third-party games and experiences.\"Last year, we committed an additional $250 million to fund VR content from developers all over the world,\" said Rubin. \"That investment supported games like Robo Recall, Rock Band VR, and Wilson's Heart, plus powerful VR experiences like Through the Ages from Felix & Paul and the Follow My Lead experience featuring the 2016 NBA finals.\"The company is now earmarking a fifth of that previously promised total for the kinds of projects that Story Studio previously would have made.\"We're going to carve out $50 million from that financial commitment to exclusively fund non-gaming, experiential VR content,\" said Rubin. \"This money will go directly to artists to help jumpstart the most innovative and groundbreaking VR ideas.\"",

    "title": "Uber reportedly under investigation over use of software to evade authorities",
    "content": "(Reuters) -- The U.S. Department of Justice has begun a criminal investigation into Uber Technologies Inc's use of a software tool that helped its drivers evade local transportation regulators, two sources familiar with the situation said.Uber has acknowledged the software, known as \"Greyball,\" helped it identify and circumvent government officials who were trying to clamp down on Uber in areas where its service had not yet been approved, such as Portland, Oregon.The company prohibited the use of Greyball for this purpose shortly after the New York Times revealed its existence in March, saying the program was created to check ride requests to prevent fraud and safeguard drivers. The Times report triggered a barrage of negative publicity for the company.The criminal probe could become a significant problem facing the company that is already struggling with an array of recent business and legal issues.An Uber spokesman and the Justice Department declined to comment. Uber lawyers said in letters to Portland authorities, which Portland made public in a report last week, that the Greyball technology was used \"exceedingly sparingly\" in that city, before the service was approved there in 2015.The nature of any potential federal criminal violation, and the likelihood of anyone being charged, is unclear. The investigation is still in its early stages, the sources said.Bloomberg news service reported the existence of a federal probe last week, but did not identify it as criminal.Uber received a subpoena from a Northern California grand jury seeking documents concerning how the software tool functioned and where it was deployed, one person familiar with the request said. That indicates a criminal investigation is underway. The second source confirmed that was the case.A subpoena from a grand jury is a formal request for documents or testimony concerning a potential crime. It does not, in itself, indicate wrongdoing or mean charges will be brought.The ride services company's board has retained an outside law firm, Shearman & Sterling LLP, to conduct its own internal investigation into what transpired, those two sources and a third said.A Shearman spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment.Uber, a venture capital-backed firm most recently valued at $68 billion, has long had a reputation as an aggressive startup.It has been battered with multiple controversies over the last few months that have raised questions about Chief Executive Travis Kalanick and led him to say he needed \"leadership help.\"The technology at issue in the criminal probe helped Uber tag some users so that they saw a different version of its standard app, the company said in a blog post in March.Uber said Greyball obscured the real location of Uber cars in various circumstances, including the possibility of physical threats or merely to test new features.The program was part of a broader Uber system, called Violation of Terms of Service, that analyzed credit card, device identification, location data and other factors to predict whether a request for a ride was legitimate, current and former employees said.The technology was used partly to prevent fraud and protect drivers from harm, the company blog post said. If a ride request was deemed illegitimate, Uber's app showed bogus information and the requester would not be picked up, the employees told Reuters.However, the Greyball technique was also used against suspected local officials who could have been looking to fine drivers, impound cars or otherwise prevent Uber from operating, the employees said.The system might have gone farther than suggested by Uber's terms of service for app users. For example, it mined credit card information to see if the owner was affiliated with a credit union used by police and checked social media profiles to assess the likelihood that the person was in law enforcement.After the Times exposed the program in March, regulators who had been unable to catch Uber in places where it was banned accused the company of obstructing their inquiries.Transportation officials in Portland investigated and reported last week that Uber had used Greyball to evade 16 Portland Bureau of Transportation officials, denying them dozens of rides, in December 2014 before Uber was authorized to operate there.The city said it found no evidence that the behavior was repeated when Uber re-entered the market in April 2015.Uber said it used the Greyball technology in December 2014, while it was operating without approval, because it was \"deeply concerned that its driver-partners would be penalized financially\" or otherwise for their driving.(By Dan Levine and Joseph Menn, editing by Peter Henderson and Bill Rigby)",

    "title": "Prey's PC port seems solid after its first patch",
    "content": "Early reports from players around the world indicate that Bethesda and Arkane have done a fine job with their latest game on PC.Prey, which hits Steam May 5, is already out in some territories, and players who are digging into the game on PC are finding that it runs well on both Nvidia- and AMD-based systems. Arkane even dropped a day-one patch that fixes a handful of audio glitches that some people were encountering during the early parts of the game. Beyond that, the biggest complaint is that Prey doesn't have a field-of-view slider. You can adjust that setting in the .ini text file in the game folder, and that makes experimentation difficult.But other than that missing menu option, Prey on PC seems to run well and supports most modern features It isn't too demanding due to its enclosed space-station design that won't force huge, open spaces onto your CPU and GPU.It also automatically supports 144hz monitors (the game defaults to a 144 frames-per-second cap). It comes with resolution options for ultrawide monitors like 24:10 displays.Above: An ultrawide resolution screenshot of Prey.Overall, it's clear that Prey is not following in the footsteps of Dishonored 2. That game had a number of performance issues and bugs in its PC version that weren't present on consoles. That's not the case here. A big reason for the difference is that Prey runs on Crytek's CryEngine instead of the Void tools that power Dishonored. CryEngine is highly optimized for PC, and that is seemingly ensuring that most modern systems can run Prey with few issues.I'm planning to go hands on with Prey myself on PC as soon as it unlocks here (Bethesda sent me an Xbox One code), and we'll have a first-hand look coming in the next few of days.",

    "content": "Torsten Reil, the founder of Zynga's NaturalMotion division, has decided to leave the company for personal reasons.Zynga just made the announcement, just after announcing its results for the first quarter. Reil has played a key role in the past couple of years at Zynga, running the United Kingdom-based studio that built the popular CSR Racing 2 game and just released Dawn of Titans five months ago.During a different era under previous CEO Don Mattrick, Zynga paid $527 million to buy NaturalMotion. That deal helped Zynga expand beyond casual games to hardcore titles on mobile, such as racing and strategy games.\"We want to thank Torsten for his many contributions to Zynga over the last three years,\" said Frank Gibeau, CEO of Zynga, in a statement. \"Torsten built a great team and launched incredible franchises like CSR, Dawn of Titans and Clumsy Ninja. On a personal note, I've enjoyed working with Torsten in my time as a board member and CEO. We respect and support his decision to take a personal break after more than 15 years with NaturalMotion. We wish him all the best on his next chapter. Going forward, David Byrne, NaturalMotion's COO, will step in to serve as interim leader of our NaturalMotion studio.\"It's not clear what kind of change this means for Zynga or the NaturalMotion studio, but Zynga believes the transition will be smooth.Zynga doesn't disclose individual game revenues. But Dawn of Titans has grossed more than $21 million to date, with more than $10 million of that in the first quarter of 2017, according to measurement firm Sensor Tower. By comparison, CSR Racing 2 has grossed more than $60 million to date, with more than $15 million of that in Q1. The revenues for Dawn of Titans appears to be good, as analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities said in a note before the call that he believes Dawn of Titans will contribute about $25 million in its first year.Gibeau said that CSR Racing 2 is going great in an interview earlier today, while he said the NaturalMotion team is working on boosting Dawn of Titans with live operations.",

    "title": "Zynga CEO: 'The most vibrant, largest, most social audiences on mobile are in messaging apps'",
    "content": "Zynga reported one of its strongest revenue quarters in years today as it hit $207 million in bookings, up 14 percent form a year ago. The drivers were growth in mobile games, improved live operations for existing games, and better operating expense efficiency. Earnings weren't quite as good, but they beat Zynga's own expectations, and the stock price is up in after-hours trading.I talked with Frank Gibeau, CEO of Zynga, in an interview today about how things are going. The company has been through a lot of ups and downs, and its mobile revenue and user growth is finally starting to compensate for its continuous decline of Facebook desktop games.But Gibeau is particularly excited about games that are embedded in the feeds of messaging systems. He said, \"The most vibrant, largest, most social audiences on mobile are in messaging apps. You've seen us start to invest development dollars and talent into building games there, because we think there's an opportunity to entertain people in chat.\" A variety of other companies are also pursuing the opportunity, including Blackstorm Labs, Big Viking Games, and Spil Games.Here's an edited transcript of our interview.Above: Frank Gibeau, CEO of Zynga.GamesBeat: It turned out to be a pretty good quarter.Frank Gibeau: It did. There are all different ways to look at it, but from a financial standpoint, we beat guidance on all the measures. We delivered some of the best results we've seen in years. We hit some records - highest revenue in years in mobile, incredible mobile growth. That's the story of the quarter. When we refocused our efforts around growing our mobile live services, it's paid off. The reinvestment in our players, adding new features--it's been a great growth engine for us.We're up 27 percent in mobile bookings. Our audience in mobile grew to 18 million daily active users, which is the highest in two years. The in-app purchasing number was up 40 percent year-over-year. That means we're putting way more value in front of our players, a lot more features and content that they're loving. It feels like we're hitting our stride there. We have so much more room to grow in live services.Poker is the one that stands out in the company right now. That's off to a blistering start in 2017. It's up 76 percent year-over-year in mobile. DAU is up 78 percent. This is a 10-year-old game in a very competitive category. That anchored our live ops performance.CSR 2 is also doing great. We had a strong holiday. We're doing a lot of the stuff that helps keep it in the position of number one racing game. We're adding new content from Lamborghini, Porsche, McLaren. New modes. We just did an integration with Fate of the Furious, which has been terrific. We've added the characters and the cars and the storyline. Fans are responding well to it.GamesBeat: I get the analyst reports from Adam Krejcik. He measures all of social casino gaming. It seemed for a while that Zynga was losing share in that category, but are you at a point where you're regaining share, bouncing back compared to other competitors?Gibeau: Social casino is kind of in two segments. One is poker, which is going extremely well for us. We're growing share there. Slots is the other part of our business -- Wonka, Wizard of Oz, Spin It Rich, Black Diamond. We've focused our efforts in that business to get to a place where we're able to grow the games over the long term effectively. The games needed more investment, in the elder games and the mid-range retention features we wanted to have. We spent the last few months focusing in on that. We're very pleased with the results there. I feel like, in social casino--depending on how you count it we're either the number two or number three company, when you put slots and poker together. We feel like we have a strong position there. Slots is in a position to grow profitably.GamesBeat: It seems like, with mergers and acquisitions, that's been a very active space.Gibeau: No kidding. It's consolidating like crazy. Between Double Down and Caesar's--it's a very active category, a very exciting category. It's one where Zynga has, over the years, built up a very strong position. It's pro ball. You have to be able to compete. I feel good about our poker and slots business together.GamesBeat: With Dawn of Titans, I guess you don't really break that out. I don't know how good this data is, but Sensor Tower has Dawn of Titans grossing about $21 million to date. How are you feeling about that title?Gibeau: It's going well. We had a good launch. We're trying to get the game into position for growth. It's a big focus right now. We're looking at the elder game, the PvP, the retention curve, how to make the Titans even more valuable and important to the gameplay. I feel like Dawn of Titans is going well, but we have more work to do there before we get it to a place where it's reaching its full potential. Much like you've seen us do in Poker and CSR 2.When you're in live ops and you really understand what players enjoy and don't enjoy, it makes your decision-making so much better. I feel like the Dawn of Titans team is so much faster and effective at building those things out now that they're live compared to when we were in development. I feel very good about Dawn of Titans over the long term. I just don't think it's reached its full potential right now. We'll keep building.GamesBeat: Where are you on employees right now?Gibeau: We're a little over 1,600 employees. It's a bit down from the last quarter, down a lot from last year. We're constantly looking at our teams and our deployments. We feel good about the talent base we have.GamesBeat: On a GAAP basis, you guys have been just barely short of profitability. Is there something that makes sense as far as operating the company here? Do you have some goals to boost it and get well above profitability?Gibeau: There's obviously GAAP and non-GAAP. Let me start with non-GAAP. The key difference is going to be stock-based compensation. On the non-GAAP basis, we're really driving hard to get that EBITDA to as high a percentage as possible. I said in my first call when I took this job, I want Zynga to be in the same conversation as Activision and EA and the rest of the top game companies. Their EBITDA percentages are up in the 30s. This last quarter, if you looked at the measurement, we hit 14.5 percent, which is the highest it's been in years. That's up from two percent in 2015.We measure that pretty carefully and make a lot of decisions to make sure we get to a profitable growing business. The best game companies in the world, and the best games in the world, are profitable, whether it's Clash of Clans or Overwatch or Battlefield. You tend to reach big audiences and you can be in a good position. So it's a signal of a healthy, high-quality game company to be profitable.In this phase of the turnaround, where we're fixing our fundamentals, what I'm talking about and driving the team to do is get to a level where our EBITDA percentages are in line with our peers. Right now we're at about 14.5 percent. I'd love for us to crest 20 percent some time in 2018, and I'd like to get into the long-term conversation with other game companies after that.On a GAP level, what we have to do is get our stock-based compensation more in line with what we can afford and what other game companies have. Traditionally, Zynga has had very high stock-based compensation, but it's down 40-odd percent year-over-year. We're starting to clean that up. Our GAP EBITDA was--last year we lost $26.6 million in Q1. This year we narrowed that down to $9.5 million. I'd like to see that go to a positive number, obviously. I'm confident we'll get that into the positive pretty soon.GamesBeat: Facebook desktop, this is always some kind of moving target, right? It's in decline. Is that making harder to continually post better numbers there?Gibeau: In any turnaround you come into, there are always legacy titles, older titles, things like the web that are just in descent. You try to manage your way through. The good news is that, this last quarter, we hit 85 percent of our revenues on mobile. We're closer to the end of the web story than at any time in our history. I feel like we have a good handle on it. But it's still a downward pressure on the business.There's a positive on Facebook, though, which is what's happening in Messenger. If you look at some of the investments and announcements that were made recently as it relates to Words with Friends, the most vibrant, largest, most social audiences on mobile are in messaging apps. You've seen us start to invest development dollars and talent into building games there, because we think there's an opportunity to entertain people in chat. Our brands lend themselves well to that environment.Facebook is powerful. It's a great partner for us. If the web business is starting to ebb away, we'll start to focus more on Messenger and opportunities like that.Above: Words With Friends is one of the first games to take advantage of the new App Store for iMessage.GamesBeat: That does feel pretty exciting. It almost seems like a return to virality.Gibeau: Absolutely. If you look at those chat channels, they can be tremendous organic customer opportunities. You're talking about a billion users on some of these apps. From my perspective, that's truly the mass-market, most social part of the phone. It would be great to have an awesome Words with Friends experience there, or Poker, or some of the other brands we've built out that people love. They're turn-based PvP, which lends itself to that context.It's very early days. We like the opportunity to innovate. It feels good to our studios. When you're in fix-it mode, in a turnaround, it's tough work. But we're going to quickly transition from fix-it to growth. That's where we're at right now. As we start to put double-digit EBITDA percentages out there and start to stabilize the business, you'll see a lot more innovation and growth coming from Zynga.GamesBeat: Is iMessage the same story?Gibeau: I think of them as platforms. They're platforms within platforms. As you know, platform transitions--you want to think of it as your friend. You want to look for opportunities to break out onto new platforms. I want to make sure Zynga is in position for what's next and not get caught out.GamesBeat: At some point, does it seem likely that if the users come into messaging games, revenues will get there as well?Gibeau: Where we're focused right now is building an audience. Apple and Facebook have made comments--certainly Facebook at their last earnings call talked about what those opportunities could be like. From my perspective, job one is making a high-quality experience that builds a big audience. The monetization will come from there.Above: Zynga's GIFs Against FriendsGamesBeat: As far as the new games that have launched, you've been on a pretty regular schedule. Are you seeing promising results from anything in particular?Gibeau: It takes a little time for mobile games to establish themselves in this market, as far as new titles. I'm excited about how CSR 2 is doing. That was a big release for us last year. We launched Crosswords with Friends today. That's moving up the free charts. We're excited to see how Words with Friends and Crosswords with Friends can start--we love our position in the words category. With the release of Boggle not too long ago, we're in a mode where we're starting to build more experiences in the words category. We want to build out that portfolio of products and give our fans more ways to play word games with us.GamesBeat: Is there anything else you'd like to add?Gibeau: We're having fun. It feels like Zynga's been in the doghouse for a while. Now, with this strong Q1 beat, the momentum internally is very positive. If you look at what we have in the marketplace in terms of live ops, the mobile numbers are great for us. We still have a lot of opportunities to grow there. It's a lot of fun at Zynga right now.",

    "content": "Activision Blizzard beat analysts expectations for both revenues and earnings on Thursday. But the big video game company also reported some figures that should be interesting for those following the game industry.The company said it was raising its guidance for the full year outlook. Digital revenues were $1.4 billion of the total $1.7 billion in total revenue for the Santa Monica, Calif.-based company.The PC accounted for $566 million of Activision Blizzard's revenue. Consoles were $615 million, and mobile and ancillary were $475 million. Other categories were $70 million. That other category makes me wonder. I would guess it includes things like esports ticket sales, toy merchandise for Skylanders, TV show revenues, and other new parts of the business.The Candy Crush series is still growing its bookings, and King and Activision are building a new Call of Duty mobile game. King has 342 million monthly active users, down from a year ago but up in terms of engagement time.But King was actually the biggest contributor to the company's revenues, with revenue of $475 million. Activision generated just $215 million in revenue, while Blizzard was $441 million (up 58 percent from the prior quarter) of the total. King and Blizzard tied in reporting operating income of $166 million each, while Activision's operating profit was just $24 million. Activision is expected to contribute more in the second half of the year with Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: World War II.Above: Candy Crush Saga now belongs to Activision.Overwatch is seeing record growth, with 41 million monthly active players, up 58 percent from a year ago. Overwatch and World of Warcraft saw a big increase in in-game purchases, which were up 25 percent for Blizzard. Hearthstone has more than 70 million registered players to date.Activision Blizzard made a $500 million prepayment on its debt during the quarter. Long-term debt stands at $4.4 billion, compared to $4.8 billion in the prior quarter. The company has $3.2 billion in cash.King's time spent per daily active user is now a record 35 minutes a day, up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. On the call, Riccardo Zacconi, head of King, said that the company is testing seven new titles.Above: Vehicles make a lot of noise in Call of Duty: WWII.",

Infobot, a bot that draws on the corpus of wikipedia.org knowledge, is among the initial bots and will appear when people ask questions.Above: Infobot screenshotHints of such an integration came last month when Bing users in the Seattle area near the Redmond, Washington Microsoft headquarters began to see bots in search results for local restaurants, according to reporting by Search Engine Land. Search \"Monsoon Restaurant Seattle\" now and you can try out the bots on Bing experience.At that time, VentureBeat reached out to Microsoft, but the company declined to comment.Along with bots on Bing and a potential Microsoft Bot Framework update, Microsoft is widely expected to continue its foray into conversational computing and release its Cortana Skills Kit. The schedule also alludes to this with sessions titled \"Create Cortana skills for your customers, partners, and workforce\" and \"Cortana skills development: Get started.\"When a Cortana Skills Kit and Cortana SDK for making third-party voice apps were announced last year, the target was February, and then Microsoft committed to releasing the skills kit in March. Neither have been released.

    "title": "With $1 billion in revenue, Overwatch is Blizzard's fastest-growing franchise",
    "content": "Starcraft, Warcraft, and Diablo are all massive names in the world of gaming, but Blizzard's latest release is potentially its biggest one yet.Overwatch is the eighth Activision Blizzard game to generate $1 billion in revenue, according to the publisher's fiscal Q1 2017 financial statement. And the company says it is the fastest-growing franchise ever from developer Blizzard. It now has 30 million registered players, and a significant number of those play on an active monthly basis. Overwatch's success has also contributed to 80 percent of Activision Blizzard's revenues coming from digital channels. That's $1.386 billion of the publisher's $1.726 billion total net revenues last quarter.In a statement, Activision Blizzard chief executive officer Bobby Kotick specifically credited Overwatch as one of the primary contributors to the company's strong results. The company's in-game content sales jumped 25 percent year-over-year, and that is largely due to people spending money on loot boxes for Overwatch.Kotick also pointed out that the shooter is one of the main reasons that so many people have joined Blizzard's gaming network. The developer has even begun using Overwatch as a way to get players into some of its other games like Heroes of the Storm with events that tie into both games.\"Blizzard had the biggest Q1 online player community in its history with MAUsA of 41 million, up 58 percent year-over-year,\" reads Activision Blizzard's financial report. \"Blizzard had record first-quarter time spent [per player], up a double-digit percentage year-over-year.\"The company also pointed out that seasonal events like the Year of the Rooster one to celebrate the lunar new year in January and the more recent one in April that looked into the Uprising event from the game's lore are important for keeping players engaged.

    "content": "For years, Zendesk has provided tools and services that helped companies engage customers, but largely from after something has gone wrong or when a problem has been identified. It was only in October when Zendesk expanded its offering to help brands be more predictive with potential trouble spots. On Thursday, the company is elevating its customer service platform with the acquisition of Outbound.io, which will help brands be more proactive in their outreach.Founded in 2013 by former Nest senior software engineer Dhruvkaran Mehta and Josh Weissburg, Outbound gives brands the tools they need to send messages to customers through SMS, responsive email, web, or push notifications. Not only has the Y Combinator alumnus' entire team been retained, but the company will become a product of Zendesk. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\"We first met Outbound while exploring partnership use cases with a joint customer,\" explained Adrian McDermott, Zendesk's president of products. \"Through this process, we observed that Outbound's philosophy of 'fewer, better messages' aligns well with our vision at Zendesk -- helping businesses have authentic, sustainable relationships with their customers through beautiful, intuitive software experiences.\"Zendesk is moving past being reactionary and wants to help businesses be proactive. In a 2016 interview, CEO Mikkel Svane told VentureBeat that customer service was evolving from \"how you can support your customers and answer them when you reach out to them, to how companies can maintain relationships and turn them into promoters of brands.\" For years, Zendesk was limited to the first part of that statement.Svane's company hopes to now be able to provide tools that can manage the entire customer lifecycle, from discovery to purchase to support afterwards. \"As a multi-product company, we want customers to have what they want, when they want it,\" McDermott remarked. \"As the lines between customer experience and customer support continue to blur, the Zendesk family of products are increasingly focused on proactively shaping the customer journeys at scale based on a customer's ongoing relationship with a business while helping businesses authentically and efficiently react to their customers.\"Outbound will have a key role in Zendesk's future, absorbing the company's Connect product, which enabled customer segmentation and push notification engagement services. Existing customers will be retained.McDermott revealed that new features coming from Outbound by Zendesk will include customer history tracking, segmenting capabilities, multi-channel messaging, campaign experimentation, analytics, and eventually \"Bring Your Own Provider,\" which lets brands incorporate third-party services into the mix, such as MailGun, SendGrid, Mandrill, Twilio, Nexmo, and Piivo.\"Zendesk has been expanding its portfolio of products to give customer engagement teams the tools they need to understand their customers and to engage with them across channels,\" McDermott said. \"Today's customer expects businesses to know more about them, to engage with them in a more personal way, and to engage with them when and how they prefer. In turn, today's businesses are looking to be more data-driven, more responsive, and more authentic as they market, sell to, and support their customers. Zendesk's portfolio is expanding to meet that need.\"Outbound had previously raised $2.07 million in venture capital, with backing from Y Combinator, Subtraction Capital, Lunch Van Fund, and a few individual investors.",

    "title": "Activision says Call of Duty: WWII trailer has 10 million views",
    "content": "Activision Blizzard reported quarterly earnings today, and the company said that the trailer for Call of Duty: WWII has more than 10 million views. It also said that last week's revelation of the game was the most-watched livestream in Call of Duty history.Activision's Sledgehammer Games is making this year's Call of Duty game, and they're taking it back to its roots in the Second World War. Activision will publish the game on the consoles and PC on November 3, 2017.Speaking at our GamesBeat Summit 2017 event, Sledgehammer cofounders Glen Schofield and Michael Condrey said they feel like Call of Duty: WWII is a personal passion project for the employees in their studio.In the single-player campaign, you'll play as soldiers in a squad in the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division, known as The Big Red One or The Fighting First. The division saw a lot of action throughout the war, starting in North Africa in Tunisia. It moved on to Sicily, Normandy, Aachen, and the Ardennes, the site of the Battle of the Bulge.Meanwhile, Activision said it had 48 million monthly active users in the first quarter, down year-over-year primarily due to expected softness from last year's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare release. Infinite Warfare took the franchise into science fiction, and gamers didn't really respond well to that.Though early, initial pre-orders for Call of Duty: WWII are off to a very strong start, Activision said. While Activision said that the number of viewers topped 10 million, the YouTube video shows 14 million views. That may mean that people are viewing the trailer multiple times.Activision and Bungie also expect to release Destiny 2 on September 8, 2017 and welcome PC players into the Destiny universe for the first time. Response to the Destiny 2 reveal was very encouraging, and pre-orders are off to a very strong start, the company said.Activision expects to release a new content offering for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 fans, Zombies Chronicles, on May 16, 2017. The remastered collection of the franchise's most beloved Zombies content will be available first on PlayStation 4.\"We expect the community to grow with Call of Duty: WWII,\" said Thomas Tippl, chief operating officer at Activision Blizzard, in an analyst call.",

    "title": "Zynga reports one of its best revenue quarters in years as mobile growth takes off",
    "content": "Zynga reported one of its strongest revenue quarters in years as it hit $207 million in bookings, up 14 percent form a year ago. The drivers were growth in mobile games, improved live operations for existing games, and better operating expense efficiency.GAAP revenue for the quarter was $194.3 million, above guidance and about 4 percent up from a year ago. GAAP net loss was $9.5 million, or 1 cent a share, compared to a loss of $35.4 million, or 4 cents a share, a year ago. But analysts measure Zynga based on its bookings and adjusted earnings before income tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA, a measure of profitability). Zynga's stock price is at $3 a share, up 5.6 percent in after-hours trading.Analysts were expecting bookings of $193 million and adjusted EBITDA of $21 million. Zynga itself had guided Wall Street to a target of $190 million in bookings and $14 million of EBITDA. The company reported bookings of $207.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $16.7 million. The latter was slightly lower than what Wall Street expected, but it was better than Zynga's own expectations.Frank Gibeau, CEO of Zynga, said in an interview with GamesBeat that the company significantly outperformed guidance on all key financial measures. Mobile revenue and bookings were the highest in Zynga history, as mobile revenue was up 19 percent from a year ago and mobile bookings were up 27 percent from a year ago.\"We are having fun,\" Gibeau said. \"Zynga has been in the dog house for a while. But the Q1 beat and mobile momentum is very positive. These are the best results we've seen in years. We've had our highest mobile growth, and refocused efforts around mobile live services. It is really paying off.\"Mobile online game revenue was up 31 percent from a year ago, and mobile user pay bookings were up 40 percent from a year ago. That was the best in Zynga history. The mobile audience is now at 18 million average daily active users (DAU), up 16 percent from a year ago, the strongest growth in two years.Above: Zynga's Q1 results on mobile games.But, as the audience for Zynga's games on Facebook on the desktop continues to decline, this still puts a drag on earnings. In the first few years before Zynga's 2011 initial public offering, desktop growth was huge. But now it is only about 15 percent of Zynga's business.\"We are closer to the end game on that,\" Gibeau said. \"It is something we had to manage our way through. In any turnaround, there are legacy titles. We are going to transition quickly from 'fix it' to growth.\"Zynga Poker saw continued to show strong results, hitting its highest quarterly mobile performance in 10 years. Mobile revenue was up 63 percent from a year ago, mobile bookings were up 76 percent, and mobile audience was up 78 percent. That's not bad for a 10-year-old game, and it's an example of bringing users back into a game and getting them to spend through events such as tournaments. Overall, social casino games are a hot $3 billion market with a lot of competition, but Zynga is investing heavily in it. Sequentially, social slots saw an improvement in average daily bookings per average DAU thanks to games like Wizard of Oz Slots.Above: Zynga Poke did well in Q1.\"This is pro ball, and you have to be able to compete,\" he said. \"Zynga has built a strong position in it.\"Mobile in-app bookings were also a record, up 40 percent form a year ago. Payer conversion rates are also improving.But the jury is still out on one of Zynga's high-end mobile strategy games, Dawn of Titans, which was made by the company's Natural Motion division and had high expectations. That game isn't doing as well as many original expected, but Gibeau said he was encouraged at the transition from launch last fall and the new emphasis on live operations for the game. The focus is on improving the \"elder game,\" player-versus-player, retention, and making Titans more important to gameplay.Zynga doesn't disclose individual game revenues. But Dawn of Titans has grossed more than $21 million to date, with more than $10 million of that in the first quarter of 2017, according to measurement firm Sensor Tower. By comparison, CSR Racing 2 has grossed more than $60 million to date, with more than $15 million of that in Q1. The revenues for Dawn of Titans appears to be good, as analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities said in a note before the call that he believes Dawn of Titans will contribute about $25 million in its first year.Gibeau said that CSR Racing 2 is going great. It had a great holiday season and that momentum continued in Q1. The company had an integration with the new Fast & Furious movie, and it now includes automotive brands like Porsche, McLaren, and Lamborghini.Meanwhile, Zynga has 1,620 employees, down 61 from the previous quarter, and down significantly from a peak of 3,500 around five years ago. Gibeau said that non-GAAP operating expenses were 58 percent of bookings, down from 68 percent of bookings a year ago. That means that Zynga is getting more efficient at making and operating its games.Above: Zynga's Q1 results for ad revenue.In Q1, the company said it had revenues from Solitaire, which offset softness in advertising. As for the difference between GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA, Gibeau attributed that to stock-based compensation, which was more aggressive in early years. Zynga is reining that in, Gibeau said.As for the future, Gibeau said he was very excited about the future of iMessage and Facebook Messenger games, which are based on HTML5 and can be played instantly in a user's message feed. The user doesn't have to download a game, and can respond immediately to an invitation to play. Gibeau sees this as a major new platform, albeit one that isn't monetizing at the moment.\"Platform transitions are your friend in the game business,\" Gibeau said. \"Job one is building a big audience. These games can be tremendous organic customer opportunities. You are talking about a billion users on the platform. That's a true mass market. It's early days, but we like the opportunity to innovate.\"In the previous fourth fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016, Zynga reported bookings of $201.5 million, up 11 percent from a year earlier, and adjusted EBITDA of $10.6 million.",

    "title": "Intel and Delphi's self-driving car handles Silicon Valley traffic just fine",
    "content": "I took my first ride in a self-driving car yesterday. It was during the grand opening of Intel's Advanced Vehicle Lab in San Jose, Calif. Automotive supplier Delphi used some Intel electronics and other tech to retrofit an Audi SUV into an autonomous vehicle. I piled into the back with a couple of other journalists and we took a two-mile drive through real Silicon Valley traffic.We had a safety driver who could take over the car in case of emergency. But once we were out on the road, the driver pressed a button and the self-driving software took over. The car's display showed what the vehicle's artificial intelligence and vision system could see, based on data coming in from 26 different sensors. I could see other cars as gray objects and possible routes in green. The sensors can generate 45 terabits of data per hour, and they help the car generate its \"world view,\" or the area around it.The sensors included cameras on all sides, Lidar (light detection and ranging), and radar. The Lidar shows you what's around the immediate vicinity, and the sensed objects, such as cars or pedestrians, show up on the screen. On the screen, you can also see the color of the traffic signal, even if it happens to be obscured from your view. That's because the traffic lights on the test route were outfitted with dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), which allow the signal to wireless broadcast the status of the signal to the sensors in the car.Above: One of the cameras on the Delphi car.The car took off just like one controlled by a human driver would. It made decisions quickly, and it pulled off a perfect lane change a couple of times, though it actually moved into the right turn lane more quickly than I would have done. When we turned into a street that had no lane markers the car wasn't confused about where the lanes were. Overall, it was a fairly complex route, with plenty of signals and traffic. Not once did the car make me worry about my safety.The car picked up speed limit changes on the signs, and it adjusted its speed accordingly. All the processing took place in the vehicle, and our driver never had to put his hands on the wheel. The route wasn't preprogrammed, though the car did have a couple of waypoints it had to reach. Beyond that, it figured out the best route on its own. The autonomous car wasn't overly cautious, and it felt very human in that way. The demo was flawless.Intel is testing a bunch of cars in the lab in San Jose. Jack Weast, chief systems architect for autonomous driving solutions at Intel, said that the multiple redundant sensors are necessary because you need to have the right tool for the job. You can't build a house with just a hammer, and you need multiple sensors and a variety of processors to handle the tasks of a self-driving car.Above: Intel's Jack Weast, system architect for self-driving cars.\"It's quite an interesting data challenge because there are lots of different kind of sensors with different kinds of processing,\" Weast said.A fully autonomous car could require 10 cameras, five Lidars, and 10 radars. With all those sensors, a single autonomous car can generate 4 terabytes a day of data, Weast said.You can connect to cellular or Bluetooth networks. Over time, Intel wants to bring 5G wireless networking into the car. That could bring tremendous speeds of multiple gigabits per second into the car. That kind of bandwidth is necessary in the future as you bring additional data into the car, such as high-definition maps. And the car computer eventually goes outside the car to the cloud for additional processing power, said Rick Topol, general manager of 5G business and technology at Intel.Above: Intel executives (left to right) Kathy Winter, Doug Davis, and Patricia Robb dedicate their new Advanced Vehicle Lab in San Jose, Calif.The AI in the car is a lot more than just computer vision. It has to be able to process voice commands and it has to learn how driving in your particular neighborhood will be different from driving in New York City, Weast said. That AI has to be very smart to be smarter than a human, who, on average, trains about 100 hours before getting a license.And the car has to be able to make a variety of decisions. Some split-second emergencies have to be dealt with in a matter of milliseconds, or a thousandth of a second. Some decisions take a few seconds, and some are longer-term decisions, said Glen De Vos, chief technology officer at Delphi. In the future, cars are going to need around 15 to 20 teraflops, or 10 to 20 times the computing power that is in cars today.I can imagine a world where we have zero drivers distracted by smartphones on the road. Zero drivers who are tired or drowsy. Zero drivers who have very little experience driving. That's the promise of self-driving cars, said Jeff McVeigh, vice president and general manager for visual computing products at Intel.Above: Yep, that's a server in the trunk.Yesterday was hot, and as I stood in the middle of the garage, I heard a humming noise. I thought it was an air conditioner, or the sound of a motor running. In fact, it was the sound of a big server running in the trunk of a car. As I looked at it, analyst Jack Gold came over and said these things are going to use a huge amount of power.Intel also showed off some other technologies that still have to be developed. One of them is a subsystem that helps build trust with the passenger. If a passenger is totally nervous about whether the car is going to crash, it won't be a fun ride. So Intel has added things like a display in the passenger window. If you use your smartphone to order your self-driving car to come pick you up, how will you know if you have the right car when a driverless vehicle drives up? The display will have your name in the window to greet you.Above: Intel's self-driving car lab.And once you get in the car, you'll see a display in the middle panel. You have to enter a pin code into the display, since you wouldn't want someone to be able to steal your phone and go joy riding. You then press a \"Go\" button on the display for a long time, since you want the car to be sure you really want to start moving.The display will show you what the car sees ahead of it. If there are a bunch of cones blocking off a lane, you don't have to worry. The display will say, \"lane closed ahead\" so you don't have to freak out that the car hasn't seen it. It's all part of making you free relaxed as a passenger. Intel will be testing the trust software in its Lincoln MKZ test car in the next month.Intel executive Doug Davis said that Intel technology powers more than 30 models of cars, and 100 million vehicles use its Wind River operating system. Intel is engaged with 33 \"tier 1\" carmakers.\"While Intel didn't show anything new at their workshop event they hadn't shown at their numerous global events, they did pull everything together into one time and place,\" said Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \"Intel's strategy is an end to end one that comprehends the data center, network, the wireless area network (WAN), and the car, and they're the only company who can offer this combination. Intel showed off this combination, and this was impressive. I believe Intel is more successful inside the car for compute than anyone gives them credit for, and it will be interesting when the disclosures are done how many designs have Intel inside.\"",

    "content": "Zapier has set its sights on the enterprise, launching a service that extends accounts beyond individuals to include entire teams. Not only can Zapier's workflow automation recipes, called \"zaps,\" be managed by multiple users, the service grants additional administrative controls for IT departments.The new service is called Zapier for Teams and costs $250 per month, with unlimited users and up to 50,000 zaps per month. Some teams may have had access previously through a beta program, but now it's widely available.With more than 1 million users, this IFTTT competitor realized many people were automating tasks for teams through individual accounts. This isn't an efficient process, and it presented Zapier with an opportunity.Now anyone can create a team, and the creater -- who could be an engineer or someone in IT -- is automatically designated the administrator and owner of the account. They then enter the billing information where everything will be charged across the team. Existing zaps can be transferred to the team from individual accounts, and anyone can modify team accounts, even when the original user isn't around.Zapier has also added new controls, such as being able to track usage and manage who has access and what zaps are part of the team. The company said additional \"team-focused features\" are coming soon.",

    "title": "Founded by former Google and Apple engineers, DeepMap is mapping the future for self-driving cars",
    "content": "DeepMap, a new mapping startup for the fledgling autonomous vehicle industry, has raised $25 million in a series A round led by Accel, with participation from existing seed-stage investors Andreessen Horowitz and GSR Ventures, which had previously invested around $7 million in the company.Not a great deal was known about DeepMap prior to now, but the Palo Alto-based company, which was founded early last year, has a number of notable people at the helm, including CEO James Wu, who previously worked at Google, Apple, and Baidu on mapping products; CTO Mark Wheeler, who also worked at Google as a software engineer and Apple as a senior scientist; and COO Wei Luo, who previously served as product manager across a number of Google projects, including Maps and Earth.Put simply, DeepMap has some experienced and knowledgeable people leading its push into the self-driving car realm.DeepMap's underlying technology helps automotive firms get up to speed, so to speak, in terms of bringing autonomous cars onto roads around the world. DeepMap provides the software that gives them accurate high-definition mapping and real-time localization, as well as the necessary infrastructure to support the rolling out of the technology to cars at scale. In effect, DeepMap serves as the eyes and the brain needed to make cars autonomous; it maps the environment, tells the vehicle where it is in relation to the environment, and shares this information with other vehicles on the DeepMap platform.There are a growing number of players working to power the self-driving car revolution. Mobileye is a computer vision firm specializing in autonomous cars too, and it was recently snapped up by Intel for $15.3 billion. Last year, General Motors (GM) snapped up Cruise Automation for more than $1 billion, while Ford recently committed to buying a majority stake in a similar startup called Argo AI for $1 billion.Other players in the field include Civil Maps and TetraVue, which have both raised venture capital investment over the past year.The problem these companies are trying to solve is this: For cars to maneuver through traffic and hazardous conditions at high speeds, they must be aware of the conditions around them -- and given the speeds at which they're traveling, there isn't a great deal of time to \"think.\" This is why quality maps and cameras capable of processing detailed imagery at speed and distances is key if the self-driving car industry is to reach its full potential -- just as humans need to use their eyes, ears, and brains to navigate roads, so do cars.\"Our goal is to help make self-driving cars and trucks drive safely and make them a reality as quickly as possible,\" explained Wu. \"The societal implications of integrating self-driving vehicles into the transportation ecosystem are considerable -- from more independence for the elderly, the young, and the handicapped to saving many lives and making commuting a more meaningful use of time. But to get there, we need precise mapping and localization technology that is purpose-built from the ground up and ensures the highest possible safety, performance, and operating efficiency. Solving this challenge to a point where it's safely deployable in the real world is very hard, time-consuming, and expensive.\"For fully autonomous cars to be realized, the automotive and technology industries must converge, and this is why we're seeing more partnerships come to the fore, either through acquisitions, investments, or simply collaborations.With a total of $32 million raised since its inception, DeepMap said that it now plans to \"optimize\" its HD mapping and localization platform and double down on its efforts to hire top technical mapping talent.",

    "title": "Gaming's new hall of famers: Donkey Kong, Halo, Pokemon Red and Green, and Street Fighter II",
    "content": "Drumroll, please. The new inductees for the World Video Game Hall of Fame have been announced, and the winners are Donkey Kong, Halo: Combat Evolved, Pokemon Red and Green, and Street Fighter II.The Strong National Museum of Play announced the inductees for 2017 at a ceremony in Rochester, N.Y., today in recognition of games that have a huge impact on gamers and world culture. It is the third time the museum has selected gaming's icons for its World Video Game Hall of Fame, and I was privileged to be one of the voters.The winners were selected by judges from a field of 12 finalists that also included Final Fantasy VII, Microsoft Windows Solitaire, Mortal Kombat, Myst, Portal, Resident Evil, Tomb Raider, and Wii Sports. The four inductees span multiple decades, countries of origin, and gaming platforms, but all have significantly affected the video game industry, popular culture, and society in general, the museum said.Released in 1981, Donkey Kong helped to launch the career of legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto and became Nintendo's most profitable game to that point, selling an estimated 132,000 arcade cabinets. Donkey Kong also introduced the world to the plucky plumber Mario--who became the star of numerous other games and one of the most recognizable video game characters in the world.\"Without Donkey Kong there would be no Super Mario Bros., a member of the inaugural class of the World Video Game Hall of Fame,\" says Jon-Paul Dyson, director of The Strong's International Center for the History of Electronic Games. \"But Donkey Kong is also about much more than one character. Its overarching narrative of love and its vibrant graphics brought the game to life in a way that few other games could in the early 1980s. It captured the hearts of a generation.\"And when Microsoft released its Xbox system in 2001, more than 50 percent of the consoles sold with the launch game Halo: Combat Evolved. The science-fiction, first-person shooter games combined an intricate storyline, memorable characters like Master Chief, and a dynamic multi-player experience. The game sold more than six million copies and inspired a number of sequels and spin-offs, as well as novels, comic books, and action figures.The Strong's Associate Curator Shannon Symonds, said in a statement, \"Until Halo's launch, the most successful shooters required a personal computer and the precision offered by a high-quality mouse. Halo proved a console could be just as effective, if not better, than a PC. It also boasted one of the strongest multiplayer experiences of its time and created a legion of hardcore fans that refer to themselves as the 'Halo Nation.'\"Above: HaloPokemon Red and Green created a multinational cultural phenomenon when it was released on the Nintendo Game Boy in 1996 as Pocket Monsters Aka (Red) and Midori (Green). The game challenged players to collect 151 unique monsters, and Nintendo coined the ubiquitous catch-phrase, \"Gotta catch 'em all!\" As of 2014, the Pokemon franchise has encompassed more than 260 million copies of its games, 21.5 billion trading cards, and numerous spinoffs including more than 800 television episodes and 17 movies. Says Symonds, \"Pokemon Red and Green launched a franchise that has taken the world by storm, vaulting many of its characters, such as Pikachu, into popular, mainstream culture. Nearly two decades after its inception and with the introduction of Pokemon Go, 'Poke-mania' shows little sign of fading.\"And here's what the museum said about Street Fighter II: Released by Capcom in 1991, Street Fighter II: The World Warrior helped to spark an arcade renaissance in the 1990s. The game inspired numerous sequels and an entire genre of one-on-one fighting games. Capcom sold more than 60,000 original cabinets and a staggering 140,000 cabinets and game conversion kits of the company's \"Champion Edition,\" making it one of the top-selling arcade games ever.\"Street Fighter II allowed for head-to- head battles between human opponents, instantly attracting spectators and generating fierce tournament play in arcades across the world,\" says Jeremy Saucier, assistant director of The Strong's International Center for the History of Electronic Games. \"This communal style of game play reinvigorated the arcade industry in the 1990s and helped give birth to a generation of fighting games.\"The World Video Game Hall of Fame at The Strong was established in 2015 to recognize individual electronic games of all types--arcade, console, computer, handheld, and mobile--that have enjoyed popularity over a sustained period and have exerted influence on the video game industry or on popular culture and society in general. Inductees were announced at The Strong museum in Rochester, New York, on May 4, 2017 and are on permanent view on the museum's second floor. Anyone may nominate a game to the World Video Game Hall of Fame. Final selections are made on the advice of journalists, scholars, and other individuals familiar with the history of video games and their role in society.I voted for Halo, Portal, Pokemon Red and Green, Wii Sports, and Donkey Kong. Three out of five isn't bad, and I figure my other votes will eventually make it into the pantheon.In my opinion, Halo proved that it was possible to make a first-person shooter game on the consoles, and it combined all the elements that make for a great game. It had beautiful music, compelling characters, a gripping story, awesome 3D grapihcs, and great sound.I also thought that Pokemon Red and Green spawned a whole generation of memories for kids and adults alike. It had simple yet addictive gameplay. And Donkey Kong was a simple game that was difficult to master. It rewarded absolute attention to the joystick, and it spawned arcade heroes like Steve Wiebe.Of course, I wasn't so lucky with my choice for Portal, which gave us memorable characters and a sense of humor that is so rare in video games. It had clever puzzles, and a funny ending. And I felt that Wii Sports deserved a spot because it widened the game market, bringing in everyone from toddlers to grandparents into the Wii generation.",

    "content": "The tablet market has now been in decline for 10 quarters in a row. Q1 2017 saw an 8.5 percent year-over-year decline: 36.2 million units shipped worldwide, compared to 39.6 million units in the same quarter last year. The very thin silver lining is that the decline was slightly less than in the previous five quarters, which all saw double-digit drops.The estimates come from IDC, which counts both slate (declining since 2014) and detachable (slightly up) form factors, meaning tablets with keyboards are included. The top two tablet makers maintained their positions: Apple was first and Samsung second. The top five vendors accounted for 60.2 percent of the market, up from 57.3 percent last year, and nobody managed to ship more than 10 million units:Apple saw its shipment numbers fall once again and lost 1.3 percentage points in market share as a result. After 13 consecutive quarters of year-over-year shipment declines, the company is back to the numbers it saw in its first year of iPad sales.Samsung shipped the same number of tablets as a year ago, which meant it ended up gaining 1.3 percentage points. In this quarter, the South Korean gained on its American competitor, which was the case for most of 2016.Huawei shipped 700,000 more units this quarter, catapulting it into third place, thanks to a 2.3 percentage point jump, ahead of Amazon and Lenovo. It was the only company among the top five to experience growth this past quarter.Amazon and Lenovo were both flat in shipments, which meant they increased their market share slightly. Nevertheless, all three of these companies are still a far cry from the market leaders.\"As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this,\" IDC program president Ryan Reith said in a statement. \"The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression.\"",

    "content": "Kiip is making it easier to redeem rewards you receive through apps in real life with the launch of Clip-to-Card. Previously, when you received a coupon you had to somehow print it out or save it to your phone and show it at checkout -- a tedious process. But the mobile advertising company now lets you transfer those moments-based rewards right onto loyalty cards from your favorite grocer.\"This is revolutionary,\" said Kiip CEO Brian Wong, in an interview with VentureBeat. \"This is the first time that any partner in the ad ecosystem has integrated Clip-to-Card into an ad unit. Usually, it's part of a landing page, or you'd have to go to coupons.com or a separate destination. Now it lives in Kiip. You can experience it in the moment you receive the reward.\"After using a Kiip-powered app, say for exercising, you might receive a coupon for Dannon or Chobani yogurt. But instead of having to print it or email it to yourself, you'll be prompted to enter your phone number or a loyalty card number. Kiip will process the information and transfer the reward right to the appropriate card. Then, when you go to the grocery store and pay for the yogurt, just swipe the grocer card and that's it -- the coupon will automatically be counted.Kiip has partnered with RevTrax to provide Clip-to-Card capabilities. \"These rewards allow brick-and-mortar retailers to create meaningful, measurable digital experiences, helping brands connect online behaviors to offline sales,\" said RevTrax vice president of partnerships Raman Sehgal.Right now, while the program is still in beta, Kiip is focused on the grocery industry, a space Wong described as \"the one that needed the most modernization\" and on businesses that have a large footprint and loyalty programs. However, Wong revealed that a similar offering will be rolled out next month, likely targeting quick service restaurants (QSR).Normally, when people get a coupon there's a high likelihood they will never redeem it. At the same time, according to Statista, a 2015 survey showed that 42.8 percent of respondents looked to mobile apps for coupons. By effectively targeting coupons and giving customers mobile tools to easily redeem them, Kiip is hoping to help users cash in on a frequently missed opportunity.Grocers and retailers will also benefit from the Clip-to-Card service because it can boost in-store sales and physical traffic.This service is currently available in the U.S, and coupons can be used in more than 10,000 stores across the country.",

    "title": "A possible AR future: Pokemon Go 10 and $500 glasses",
    "content": "Consumer-ready augmented reality glasses are possible to make right now. But it might cost you at least $500.With AR, developers can project data and other useful visualizations in the real world without obstructing a person's view. But a few steps -- both technical and ethical in nature -- need to happen before everyday people can start buying their own hardware. That was one of the topics discussed at the future of AR panel at this week's GamesBeat Summit in Berkeley, California.Panelists talked about what should be the ideal AR experience for consumers. According to Ralph Osterhout, chief executive of the Osterhout Design Group, the idea of re-creating Star Trek's Holodeck -- a common aspiration for AR and virtual reality enthusiasts -- is unrealistic. He said it'd be \"frightfully expensive\" and that the costs won't go down any time soon.Osterhout prefers the flexibility that comes with AR glasses, saying that should be \"the Holodeck going forward.\" His company makes and sells the R-series of high-end AR glasses, like the $2700 R-7s.John Hanke, CEO of Pokemon Go studio Niantic Labs, thinks $200 would be the sweet spot for mainstream adoption.\"If Ralph could ship a pair of glasses today that do what the latest version of his glasses do for $200, where lots of people could afford that and there'd be an install base, I think game designers could make some incredible experiences,\" said Hanke.\"I don't think that we should fixate on waiting for the ultimate piece of hardware. It's really getting an install base and working within those [technical] constraints.\"Above: ODG augmented reality smartglasses at CES 2017.But, as Osterhout argued, getting to that price point will take nothing short of a miracle.\"The [Samsung Galaxy] S8 has a [Snapdragon] 835 Qualcomm processor ... . The glasses that I make today are made with the 835,\" he said. \"All the stuff that's in the highest-end smartphones -- about $1,000 -- are what's in the glasses, except that you've got a world of difference [with the] two displays, and each display is the size of your fingernail.\"He later added: \"[The tech] exists. But there's no such thing as a free lunch. You don't get to jam in another screen from a high-end smartphone into a tiny device and say, 'I want that son-of-a-bitch for free!' Everybody wants to have a Ferrari. But the sheer fact of the matter is if you're driving a Prius, you're not gonna be able to do everything that the Ferrari can do. ...\"Will [glasses] get down to $200? I'll tell you honestly: Anybody here that can do it, please see me. You're hired. Follow me out the door!\"However, Osterhout wasn't all doom and gloom. Realistically, he thinks someone could make $500 glasses that offer a quality AR experience. But they'd have to make and sell \"many tens of millions\" of glasses to make it feasible. That'd be the only way to drive the costs of components down.And then you have to deal with privacy concerns when wearing the glasses in public (as the Google Glass backlash demonstrated in the past).\"That's one of the places where science fiction can really help, in taking two or three steps ahead and -- [as sci-fi author Eliot Peper] said onstage just a minute ago -- trying to project the consequences, expected and unexpected, of technologies that are on the cusp [of becoming real],\" said CEO of Oblong Industries John Underkoffler.But the presentation ended on an optimistic note. Moderator and GamesBeat lead writer Dean Takahashi jokingly asked Hanke what a theoretical Pokemon Go 10 would like with advanced AR technology.\"Well, I think those [pocket] monsters are gonna feel really real to you. I think they're gonna be with you,\" said Hanke. \"I think you're gonna be friends with them. Your kids are gonna have them in the house and they're gonna be like pets. ... It'll be a fun journey getting there.\"",

    "title": "YL Ventures Closes on a $75 Million Fund to Invest in Seed Stage Israeli Entrepreneurs",
    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO & TEL AVIV, Israel-(BUSINESS WIRE)-May 4, 2017- YL       Ventures, the premier seed stage venture capital firm headquartered       in Silicon Valley while investing in Israel, today announced it has       closed its third fund, YLV III. The new fund builds on the success of       its two prior funds, both of which generated returns in the top quartile       of all North American Venture Capital funds, according to Preqin.          YLV III was significantly over-subscribed with nearly 100 percent of       existing YLV II investors participating, and closed on $75 million, 25       percent above its target of $60 million. The fund will invest in seed       stage Israeli companies in high-growth sectors including cybersecurity,       enterprise software, autonomous vehicles, drone technologies and VR/AR. 1       YLV III aims to invest in two to three companies per year. Initial seed       investments will be $2-3 million, with YL Ventures leading the rounds. A       large portion of the fund is reserved to participate in U.S. VC-led       follow-on rounds of its portfolio companies.          Heading the new fund is Silicon Valley-based Managing Partner Yoav       Andrew Leitersdorf, a serial entrepreneur and early stage investor for       25 years who founded the firm in 2007. Rounding out the team is Ofer       Schreiber, partner, leading the Israeli office; Iren Reznikov, senior       analyst, and Sharon Seemann, marketing director. YL Ventures is       currently recruiting additional investment professionals to join its       Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv offices.          Leitersdorf attributes the heightened interest in YLV III to soaring       cybersecurity spending, expected to exceed $202 billion in 2021,       according to Markets&Markets, and the deep domain expertise and       experience in cybersecurity that Israeli entrepreneurs possess, most of       who graduated from the IDF's intelligence units.          \"For YL Ventures, this convergence represents an opportunity to address       evolving security risks and leverage Israel's unique talent pool to meet       mounting global demand for the most effective solutions,\" said       Leitersdorf.          \"Israel is a well-known powerhouse for cybersecurity and related       technological innovation. We are able to harness that expertise to       expand into new sectors that leverage artificial intelligence, machine       learning, computer vision, big data and robotics, all of which are       highly relevant to our new fund. While remaining extremely selective, we       can vet ideas fast, devote substantial attention to helping our       companies scale, and provide a lot of value post-investment.\"          YL Ventures is also expanding its leadership team with the addition of a       number of high-caliber and experienced venture advisors. Justin Somaini,       chief security officer at SAP, is the first of these. A prominent       security industry angel investor, board member and advisor to many       security startups, Somaini said he is eager to deepen his relationship       with YL Ventures and assist early-stage cybersecurity startups coming       out of Israel to scale their businesses globally.          \"I've been collaborating with YL Ventures for some years now and know       they have unparalleled access to Israeli cybersecurity talent and       innovation,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward with great anticipation to       working more closely with the entrepreneurs the fund selects to help       them bring the next wave of technological innovation to market.\"          Based in both Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, the firm has early       and deep access to the Israeli entrepreneurial ecosystem as well as       an active presence and strong network in the U.S.          \"Out of the hundreds of startup ideas we evaluate every year, we only       invest in the select few we believe are the most brilliant. This enables       us to truly partner with the founders, actively support each company and       give it the full attention it deserves,\" said Schreiber. \"We then       leverage our Silicon Valley presence to create business opportunities       and guide founders through the challenges of penetrating global markets       and building great companies. It's a model that is not easily reproduced       and creates a true win/win for entrepreneurs and investors.\"          This model has yielded a track record of successful exits. The combined       funds, YLV I and II, have invested in 10 companies, five of which have       already been successfully acquired. Most recently, FireLayers (cloud       access security broker) was acquired by Proofpoint, and BlazeMeter       (performance testing platform for DevOps) was acquired by CA.          Among the current YL Ventures portfolio companies: Twistlock,       (virtual container security), which last week announced       a $17 million Series B funding round; Karamba       Security (Autonomous Security for autonomous and connected cars);       and Hexadite       (security orchestration and automation).          Yair Grindlinger, FireLayers co-founder and now vice president of       Information Protection Products at Proofpoint, said, \"YL Ventures was       not just an investor, they were an integral part of our team and       essential to our successful exit. YLV's entire model is built around       helping entrepreneurs. They commit time and resources and continue to       back the companies over the long-term.\"     Resources:YL       Ventures Portfolio CompaniesVideos:YL       Ventures \"Our Story\"Portfolio       TestimonialsBlogs:Trends       in Israel's Cybersecurity InvestmentsIsraeli       Startups Deliver Much Needed Tech for Self-driving CarsThe       Drone Race is off and RunningExits:The       Story of FireLayers, From a Shabby Steakhouse in Netanya to a $55       Million Exit to ProofpointThe       Inside Story of BlazeMeter, from First VC Meeting to Exit  Tweet This: .@YLVentures closes $75M fund for seed stage Israeli       entrepreneurs #cybersecurity #drones #AI #autonomouscars http://bit.ly/2pik3ya  About YL Ventures       YL Ventures is a seed-stage venture capital firm that invests in       cybersecurity, enterprise software, autonomous vehicles, drone       technologies and VR/AR companies, with particular focus on the Israeli       market.

    "content": "Not everyone is a coding wiz. So Heap wants to automate analytics tools to make it easier for marketers and sales reps to track user interaction. The San Francisco-based startup announced today that it has secured an additional $27 million in a round co-led by Menlo Ventures and New Enterprise Associates (NEA). Existing investors Initialized Capital and Pear VC also joined.Customers incorporate a snippet of code on their website that automatically captures every user interaction, including clicks, taps, gestures, form submissions, and page views.The story behind Heap echoes that of many other Silicon Valley startups. Founders Matin Movassate and Ravi Parikh studied computer science at Stanford, then, in 2013, they joined Y Combinator's Winter 2013 batch, where they founded Heap, which has since collected a total of $40 million. The startup currently has 45 employees.Movassate, who is the CEO, claims Heap has more than 6,000 customers, including Casper, Lending Club, The Atlantic, Twilio, and Zendesk. The startup offers two pricing tiers -- a free one for growing teams and a custom pricing option for the entire company.When asked whether Heap uses artificial intelligence (AI), Movassate replied: \"Not yet. We think the first step to building useful AI is...collecting a massive dataset.\"With increasing automation and the implementation of simpler analytics tools, the role of engineers is taking a new turn. \"Now their time is freed up to do interesting work, not set up analytics plumbing for others,\" said Movassate. \"Many of our biggest users and advocates are engineers.\"Movassate claims to be largely winning business from Adobe Analytics (Omniture), Mixpanel, and Google Analytics.",

    "content": "Fastdata.io, a real-time stream processing company, said today it has raised $1.5 million from Nvidia and other investors.The startup was built on the idea that its stream processing software engine could use graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate just about any kind of real-time data processing. And it can accelerate real-time streams at about three orders of magnitude faster than current competing stream engines, such as Apache Spark.Santa Monica, Calif.-based Fastdata.io will use the financing to invest in developing the company's product, marketing, and talent acquisition. The company's leader is CEO Alen Capalik, who has expertise directing low-level kernel development for high-frequency trading financial systems and advanced cybersecurity technology.\"I've had to do real-time processing for security and high-frequency trading in my past life, and I was always underwhelmed,\" Capalik said in an interview. \"But when Nvidia came out with CUDA, exposing GPUs for a different kind of processing, that was an 'aha' moment for me. We are developing software that can accelerate all the real-time workloads.\"\"[Security is] a huge problem,\" Capalik said. \"If you have hackers, you have to know what is happening in real time.\"He said that the company can accelerate real-time stream processing at 2.5 to 3 times faster than rival Spark.Fastdata.io has developed high-performance computing (HPC) software, called FDIO Engine, which exploits the massively parallel processing capability of GPUs to provide economical, real-time, inline processing of big data in motion. Capalik said this could really accelerate processing in real time for applications such as finance, fraud, security, artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, self-driving cars, and the Internet of Things.Jeff Herbst, vice president of business development at Nvidia, said in an interview with VentureBeat, \"We were attracted to this because it's a turbocharged version of what can be done with GPUs. There's a huge amount of data in the world, with more created in the last six months than in the last 1,000 years. A lot of it can't be processed in real time. If they can make this happen, it solves a huge problem in the data-processing ecosystem.\"The software can also reduce power requirements in the data center by more than 90 percent, whether running in the public cloud or on private servers. This new level of efficiency will save billions of dollars in power costs, while tremendously reducing carbon emissions for cloud providers, the company said.Fastdata.io will exhibit at the GPU Technology Conference on May 8-11, 2017, in San Jose, Calif. The company was started in 2016 and has 10 employees. It will launch a private beta this summer and a public beta later in the year.Nvidia has also invested in other companies that are tackling a piece of the task, like MapD and Datalogue. And Nvidia has stepped up its investment in AI startups in the past year.\"We are circling the problem from so many angles now, with artificial intelligence and GPUs being used to solve big problems,\" Herbst said.",

    "content": "Nothing lights up the brain quite like the rich, lyrical melodies of composer Camille Saint-Saens' The Swan, carefully played on a cello.Noted physician and author David Agus was deep in thought as he listened to a live, solo performance of The Swan at Fortune's Brainstorm Health conference in San Diego on Wednesday. But Agus wasn't merely relaxing. Attached to his head was a high-tech black visor connected to what resembled several mini microphones, each one resting on different parts of his skull. The headset was monitoring the electrical activity of Agus' brain in real time.Audience members watched a 3D representation of Agus' brain respond to the music by way of electrical pulses. Throughout the song, different areas of his brain lit up like a mini-firework display.Dr. Olivier Oullier, a neuroscientist and former head of global strategy in health care at the World Economic Forum, using a laptop, rotated a graphic of Agus' brain so people could see each brightly colored pulse form and dissipate. As the song progressed, the pulses seemed to get a little bigger and more dense, resembling tightly packed, multi-colored spider webs.\"My brain loved what you played,\" Agus joked to the cellist.Oullier explained that the headset is a modern version of what academics and researchers have been using for years to study brain activity. What's different, however, is that the headset costs as much as a video game console as opposed to the older devices that could sell for $100,000. Microsoft's popular Xbox One sells for $300.Oullier hopes that physicians will eventually use these headsets, which are far less bulky than their predecessors, to help treat patients with mental disorders. For example, doctors could one day routinely use the headsets to obtain a \"quantitative measurement of depression\" in patients based on their brains' electrical activity, Agus said. From that information, they could then prescribe the most accurate dosage of medicine for each patient \"almost instantaneously,\" he added.\"It is not about being able to read the minds of the patient,\" Oullier said about the brain-scanning technology. Rather, the headsets could help doctors understand how the brain's signals are affected by the drugs.This story originally appeared on Fortune.com. Copyright 2017",

    "content": "Google has revealed that it's combining new deep learning smarts with Street View to make it easier to automate the process of mapping new addresses for Google Maps.Anyone living in a town or major conurbation will likely have seen Google's Street View cars, replete with 360-degree camera, traversing thoroughfares over the past few years to capture everything from shop facades and monuments to parks and alleyways. While the camera collects imagery of the real word to complement Google Maps, it's also possible to extract additional information from the photos -- including street numbers and names -- to improve the data available in Google Maps.However, numerous factors, such as lighting, angles, distortions, or cluttered backgrounds, can make it difficult for a machine to properly identify names and numbers.Above: Examples of challenging signs captured by Street ViewOver the years, Google has dabbled with a number of methodologies to help improve data captured from Street View imagery, including ReCAPTCHA, which involves human crowdsourcing to help identify the content of an image.More recently, Google has turned to deep neural networks to automate the process of \"reading\" the content of images, and its latest algorithm achieves \"84.2 percent accuracy on the challenging French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset,\" according to a blog post. The post adds that it is \"significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art systems.\" Google has made the model publicly available on GitHub through Tensorflow, the open-source machine learning software library developed by Google.Though Google already uses neural networks in Street View -- to obscure car license plates and faces, for example -- the company is also using similar methodologies to extract useful information, such as street numbers, which Google says have been used to \"improve\" location data in one-third of addresses globally. But addresses don't just consist of numbers, which is why Google has been working to expand the system to include street names, too. The system is also capable of replacing abbreviations with full names (e.g. \"Avenida\" rather than \"Av.\") and ignoring any irrelevant text within the photo.This automated system enhances the ability to map new streets and add buildings that may not yet have made it onto a city's official maps. More than that, the same underlying system -- using different training data -- can also read business names, which further enables it to automatically update new business listings on Google Maps.So by combining the location data from Street View car's GPS with address information and business names extracted from imagery, Google could effectively map an entire city without any pre-existing knowledge of the layout or nomenclature.",

    "content": "The escalating legal battle between Apple and Qualcomm may hit U.S. consumers next.Qualcomm is preparing to ask the agency that polices U.S. imports to block iPhones from entering the country, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing an anonymous source. The International Trade Commission has the authority to restrict imports of goods that violate intellectual property rights.Apple had some older Samsung phones blocked by the agency in 2013, for example, over alleged infringement of two patents. Although the iPhone is designed by Apple, it is manufactured in Asia and must be imported to reach U.S. consumers.Apple and Qualcomm declined to comment when contacted by Fortune.The dispute between the two titans of the mobile business broke out after Apple started using modem chips from Intel in about half of new iPhones last year, instead of buying all its chips from Qualcomm. Apple sued Qualcomm in January, saying Qualcomm's royalties, imposed on iPhones both with and without Qualcomm's chip set, were excessive. Qualcomm counter-sued on April 10, accusing Apple of harming its business and breaching deals between the two companies.If Qualcomm seeks to have iPhone imports stopped, the move would follow Apple's decision to completely stop paying royalties to Qualcomm for the wireless technologies included in the device. Qualcomm disclosed last week that Apple was withholding the disputed fees, which total about $500 million for the second quarter. Over the previous three quarters, Apple had withheld only a portion of the fees, totaling $1 billion.Shares of Qualcomm have lost 16% so far this year, as the dispute with Apple and various regulators around the world have threatened the company's business. Qualcomm invented many core technologies over decades that are now used in wireless networks and smartphones. The chip maker charges royalties for a portion of the value of every phone sold, whether it contains communications microprocessor chips made by the company or by its rivals, arguing that some of its inventions must be referenced in every chip. But Apple and regulators claim Qualcomm is abusing a dominant market position to extract excessive payments.Qualcomm's royalty agreements are with Apple's contract manufacturers like Foxconn, not directly with Apple. Apple has said it had been trying unsuccessfully to negotiate a direct licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years.During a call with analysts on Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained Apple's reasoning for withholding the royalties.\"You can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount-you don't know how much to pay,\" Cook said. \"I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that,\" he also noted, referring to the possibility that Qualcomm might seek to have iPhone sales blocked. \"I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see.\"This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.

    "title": "DayZ is finally going into beta, but the survival battleground has shifted since 2014",
    "content": "DayZ is one of the most successful Early Access Steam games ever, and it's still in an open \"alpha\" testing stage. But that is going to come to an end soon as developer Bohemia Interactive moves it into a beta phase. But after years of minor updates, DayZ's time might have already passed.Bohemia revealed this week that it has a small team working on the 0.62 update for DayZ that is due out soon because most of its staff is working on the 0.63 update that will finally move the online zombie survival sim into a beta state. DayZ debuted as mod for the Arma military shooter in 2013. In 2014, Bohemia worked with the mods creator, Dean Hall, to release a standalone version that sold a million copies in 4 weeks in 2014. But since then, DayZ has withered from a lack of regular updates that address key issues.\"The 0.62 patch was originally planned for delivery on the Experimental branch during the second week of April,\" lead producer Eugen Harton wrote in a blog post. \"But due to complications and cooperation on engine milestones, it became apparent that we needed to close [the 0.62 and beta updates] sequentially, rather than working on both at once. Remember that only small team is working on 0.62 at the moment, as almost all of us are focusing on BETA/0.63 delivery.\"So what changes can you expect in the beta? Well, Bohemia is dumping a lot of legacy code and systems that are holding the game back. This will manifest primarily in the way your character handles weapons, aiming, and melee combat. The studio also goes over a number of other changes in its lengthy blog post, but all of this is possibly way too little and far too late.DayZ fans have waited for years for the game to get back on track. Right now, important elements like the zombies don't interact with the players properly. This has led to a surge in negative reviews for the game.On Steam, DayZ's recent rating is \"mostly negative,\" with 28 percent of 1,825 reviews giving it a thumbs up over the last 30 days. This has brought the game's overall review score down to 67 percent, which Steam considers \"mixed.\"At the same time as more and more DayZ fans turn against the game and Bohemia, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and H1Z1: King of the Kill have launched a new wave of megapopular Early Access games. In these games, you play as a survivor who must collect weapons and other items to ensure you're the last person standing as the safe play area gets smaller and smaller. Like DayZ, these games are spinoffs of Arma, but unlike Bohemia's zombie game, King of the Kill and Battlegrounds have tens of thousands of daily active players. That's not to mention games like Ark: Survival Evolved, Rust, and others that do a lot of what DayZ does, but better. And so even if DayZ does improve, it will likely have a difficult time ripping attention away from the latest competition.",

    "content": "(Reuters) -- Facebook Inc shares dipped from a record high on Wednesday after the world's biggest online social network warned investors once again that its advertising revenue growth would likely come down from current high levels.The warning appeared to outweigh Facebook's surging quarterly profit and revenue, fueled by growth in its mobile ad business, which is still not showing much sign of slowing down as the company nears the five-year anniversary of its initial public offering.Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement it was a \"good start to 2017.\"Facebook's shares fell 2.7 percent in after-hours trading to $147.60. They had closed at an all-time high of $153.60 on Tuesday.Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said on a conference call after the earnings announcement that the company expects its ad revenue growth to come down significantly over the rest of 2017, repeating prior company warnings that it is hitting a limit in \"ad load,\" or the number of ads it can squeeze onto users' pages before upsetting them.Facebook said quarterly profit rose 76.6 percent year-over year to $3.06 billion and total revenue went up 49 percent to $8.03 billion.The company caused some brief confusion on Wall Street by only issuing numbers conforming to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) without warning. Previously it also issued non-GAAP numbers, which it had said provided greater transparency and were closely watched by investors and analysts.The social media giant is expected to generate $31.94 billion in mobile ad revenue globally in 2017, up 42.1 percent from a year earlier, according to research firm eMarketer.That would give Facebook a 22.6 percent share of the worldwide mobile ad market, with archrival Google of Alphabet Inc projected to be the leader with a 35.1 percent share, according to eMarketer.Facebook continued its march toward the 2 billion user threshold, saying it had some 1.94 billion people using its service monthly as of March 31. That was up 17 percent from a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected monthly active users of 1.91 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.Net income attributable to Facebook shareholders rose to $3.06 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the first quarter from $1.73 billion, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier.Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 85 percent of the company's total advertising revenue of $7.86 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with about 82 percent a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected total ad revenue of $7.68 billion, according to FactSet.Earlier in the day, Zuckerberg said the company would add 3,000 people over the next year to monitor and remove murders, suicides and other inappropriate material from its network, which have become a threat to Facebook's valuable public image.(Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru and David Ingram in San Francisco; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Bill Rigby)",

    "title": "Chris Roberts: No pressure to make Star Citizen 'absolutely perfect'",
    "content": "In some ways, Star Citizen is the culmination of a 20-year-old dream.The last time Chris Roberts and Rich Hilleman worked together was back in 1993, when games were still transitioning from floppy disks to CD-ROMs. This week, both men -- Roberts is now CEO of Roberts Space Industries (RSI), and Hilleman is a director at Amazon Game Studios -- reunited at the GamesBeat Summit in Berkeley, California. They were on a panel about Star Citizen, Roberts's space-faring action-adventure game.Aside from its lofty ambitions, Star Citizen is notable for the massive amount of money it's drawn in crowdfunding campaigns, raising more than $144 million to date.\"Twenty years ago, you were much more limited by how you could display, how you could render, how you could interact [with games]. ...,\" said Roberts. \"During that time, myself and the other people working on Wing Commander and other games would always fantasize about what the dream game would be: where you could go anywhere, it'd all be the same level of detail, run around and interact with stuff, go to planets, fly ships -- all seamlessly.\"That was the big reason why I came back to doing games when I came back for Star Citizen. The technology had moved along enough that I felt like you could actually realize that vision.\"Above: 21 years later, Wing Commander developer Chris Roberts hired Mark Hamill to star in his new game.In the early '90s, Roberts said they had to use a lot of \"smoke and mirrors\" to give the illusion of a massive universe players could explore. Now it's possible to create a simulated environment that gives players the freedom to do what they want to do, and in turn, letting them forge an emotional connection with the world.\"That's my dream: I want to live in this world [from] another place, or time in the case of Star Citizen. My whole career has been about trying to create experiences to get close to that [idea],\" said Roberts.Like the massively multiplayer online game Eve Online, Roberts wants Star Citizen to be heavily driven by its players. When Star Citizen is complete (it's in a beta state and doesn't have a specific release date), their actions will help shape the story. Roberts noted that the hardcore community financially backing them have been \"very patient\" with the team as they work on the game.Toward the end of the presentation, Hilleman asked Roberts if Star Citizen will be the last game he ever makes, given how the studio can just keep updating and tweaking the multiplayer experience for years to come. He didn't answer with a \"yes\" or a \"no,\" but he did note how being an online MMO changes the post-ship relationship with players.\"That's one of the things I find very attractive about [the project]: I don't feel the pressure to have this one release be absolutely perfect,\" Roberts said. \"I feel like it's an ongoing relationship with the people, the community ... . And as things get better, we can improve it. We can improve the stories and add more content. It's an ongoing process.\"",

    "title": "The lane-keeping on this roadster provides plenty of options",
    "content": "Veering out of your lane is one of the leading causes of road fatalities. Combine that with using your phone while driving and we're really asking for trouble.For now, the concept of the connected car mostly concerns using our phones, but if you do that while driving, your attention shifts downward. Scientists often compare this to drunk driving -- it's essentially a black-out where your mind literally doesn't see around the car. It matches up with something called sustained attention span, the part of the brain that can focus on one thing at a time, usually for about 5-10 minutes. It's a good thing -- else we'd be having squirrel moments constantly -- but if you try to text and drive, you know that your brain can't multitask. You will drift out of the lane; you will plow into the car stopped in front of you.Above: The lane-departure warning system has several unique options.On the 2017 Mazda MX-5 Miata, there's an unusual number of features to help. Lane-keeping was never intended to encourage someone to use their phone; it's a tool for drivers who maybe sip a coffee or glance at a friend in the passenger seat. A loud warning beep emits when you veer out of the lane, as if to remind you not to spend any sustained attention on the radio selection or, heaven forfend, your phone. Unlike several other cars I've tested, there are quite a few options for how you configure this. You can adjust whether the lane-keeping kicks in at the lane marking or slightly before you veer out of the lane. In my tests, both have their value. If you use \"at\" the marking, it's a little less annoying. \"Before\" can chime too often.You can also adjust how loud the beep sounds: low, medium or high. There's a setting for the \"rumble strip\" sound, although it sounds more like feedback from an amp. When you drive, that low drone gets your attention right away.These adjustments are helpful because every driver is different. You might keep the radio off as you ramble over a country road, and a soft chime is all you really need. You might be in commuter traffic and don't want to hear the chime when you touch a lane marking because you're moving so slowly anyway -- all you want to know is if you start moving slightly out of the lane (the \"at\" setting). I could see these options expanding even further, letting drivers adjust the cruise control sensitivity as well (some luxury cars do allow this already).In the future, connected cars will have similar settings related to traffic and infrastructure. For example, you'll be able to set how quickly your autonomous car takes a turn in an urban area or how wide it usually swings out when you're in a parking lot. You might set the robotic controls for \"comfortable\" or \"dynamic\" driving someday.For now, the Mazda MX-5 Miata -- a fun two-seater with a fold-down top that costs $31,270 -- has a few more settings for lane-keeping, although it doesn't use technology to actually keep you in your lane (it's only a warning system). I liked how much you can configure the options, and that Mazda chose to use a dial between the seats to select options in the touchscreen -- similar to a Mercedes or a BMW -- so that drivers stay focused on the road.It makes the car safer, especially if you like to drive with a little punch. Maybe the Miata chimes aren't that annoying after all.Above: VB Profiles Connected Cars Landscape. (Disclosure: VB Profiles is a cooperative effort between VentureBeat and Spoke Intelligence.)

Among its touted accomplishments includes a dedicated TV app to stream videos; a new tool enabling people to help one another following a disaster; adding support for job listings on Pages; bringing Snapchat Stories to more apps such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and the social network; generally releasing the first product featuring its M artificial intelligent assistant; acknowledging the impact of fake news shared on the social network; even contributing to a $14 million fund to aid in news integrity; and let's not forget the slew of announcements that emerged from the company's F8 developer conference last month.The previous quarter was also marked by Mark Zuckerberg's 6,000-word letter that's a manifesto for why we need communities and globalism, bucking sentiment from some world leaders and further sowing seeds about the Facebook chief's potential presidential run in the future (he has denied it).As Facebook moves forward, it's in search of ways to overcome new issues around its rapid growth, such as diversity problems, properly tracking ad performance, and what to do about its Facebook Live problem.

That kind of dough can buy you ~3,600,000 bottles at any hot club. Or ~816 million hours of GPU server time from AWS.

Most of us couldn't freestyle rap to save our lives. DeepBeat tackles the challenge by first looking at rap lyrics and predicting the next line. These predictions are then combined to merge lines from existing songs into new rhymes with meaning.The team started with half a million lines of rap songs from over 100 artists. Lyrics creation was then modeled as an \"information retrieval\" problem, where the query is the first x number of lines of a song, and the answer is the most relevant follow-up lyrics. This approach simplifies the challenge of measuring performance, because accuracy can be assessed against actual songs. A generative model that constructs new lyrics word by word would yield more creative output, but also drive the complexity up significantly. Perhaps an aspiring academic should hustle on this front and produce a Dope Learning 2 paper.After mapping lines to high-dimensional vector space, DeepBeat leverages a Ranking SVM to pick the most relevant next lyric. Document ranking algorithms like PageRank use a single static ranking, but accuracy can be dramatically improved by combining multiple features via machine learning algorithms. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are typically used for textual predictions, but since rap lines are relatively short and equal in length, a feedforward network is a simpler and still suitable architecture for this problem.Above: DopeLearning's feedforward network architecture. Image Credit: \"DopeLearning: A Computational Approach to Rap Lyrics Generation,\" Malmi et al.Now for a lesson in rhyme schemes. Rap lyrics rarely employ \"perfect rhymes\" such as \"Hey I got GPUs, but Google's got TPUs.\" Alliteration rhymes involve repeating the opening sounds of adjacent words, such as \"Turing Test\", but don't require the words start with the same letter, as in \"Know Your Neural Networks.\" Alliteration is a special subset of consonance, which is the repetition of consonants. Consonants can be matched throughout a word, as in \"mode collapse just makes me gasp.\" Assonance is the repetition of vowels and is by far the most popular rhyme scheme due to its versatility. Consider this sentence: \"It is my greatest dream to build a deep learning machine.\" Finally, you can have multisyllabic rhymes. Sorry, no example -- I spent 15 minutes trying to come up with a deep learning themed multisyllabic rhyme using only assonance but failed. Rapping is hard...DopeLearning detects rhymes by translating words into phonetic representations and computing \"rhyme density,\" which represents the \"average length of the longest rhyme per word.\" The measure positively correlates with the complexity rating human rappers give their own lines. Song structure is another pattern the network must learn, as songs often alternate between verses and chorus. Any particular rhyme scheme can be maintained for multiple lines or even an entire verse or chorus.Above: DopeLearning's feedforward network architecture. Image Credit: \"DopeLearning: A Computational Approach to Rap Lyrics Generation,\" Malmi et al.DeepBeat launched in November 2015 and attracted 42,000 users by June 2016. The tool enables users to select keywords that must appear in generated lyrics, get automated suggestions, and also write their own content. Performance was measured in three distinct ways. For selecting the next lyric, the algorithm was given 299 randomly selected lines and asked to choose the best line. The result was an accuracy of 17 percent, or 50x better than chance. Second, using the measure of rhyme density (mathematical details can be perused in the paper), DeepBeat outperformed human rappers by 21 percent. Finally, real user data from the DeepBeat online tool was analyzed and machine choices correlated with lines preferred by humans.Dr. Dre, I hope you're ready for your epic rap battle against MC DeepBeat.Mariya Yao is the head of research and design at TOPBOTS, a strategy and research firm for applied AI.

Fans accompanied by the virtual doctor in a virtual TARDIS must solve a series of puzzles, quizzes, and other challenges to discover the six Keys of Life and save the universe.The Doctor Who bot is made to be episodic, so every Sunday at 6 p.m. British Summer Time (BST) -- that's 10 a.m. Pacific -- a new chapter will be released.\"Along with the six adventures, you'll have a unique chance to meet and interact with the Doctor through text, videos, and gifs, as he guides you through each challenge. And be sure to use the brand new Doctor Who Mojis also launching today,\" the Skype Team said in a blog post today.Doctor Who is the second high-profile Skype bot to be released in recent weeks for the U.K. market. Last month Skype released its very first cooking bot with British celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal.Several television shows now use bots for advertising or to reach fans. Humans from Channel 4 has a Facebook Messenger bot, HBO's Westworld is on Google Assistant, and Amazon Original series The Grand Tour uses an Alexa skill to reach its fans. Last week, ahead of the release of Genius, a biopic series about his life, an Albert Einstein bot made its debut on Facebook Messenger.The Doctor Who bot can be found in the Skype Bot Directory in roughly a dozen countries around the world including the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, Russia, India, France, and Spain.Correction: The original version of this article stated that the show Top Gear has an Alexa skill when in fact it should have said Amazon Original series The Grand Tour has an Alexa skill.",

    "title": "Quake Champions isn't Overwatch, but it borrows the right ideas",
    "content": "Let me just admit this upfront: I haven't played a lot of Quake in my life. During that time of the late 1990s, I focused on Nintendo 64 shooters like GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. Please don't flame me. So id Software's return to Quake Champions doesn't mean the same thing to me that it might mean to you, but I can still appreciate some of the anxiety around the changes this game is making to the Quake formula.While the classic entries in this series delivered a multiplayer arena where everyone had the same basic capabilities, health, armor, and movements, Champions introduces heroes. And while that might sound like the antithesis of Quake's beloved skill-based gameplay, I am coming away from the beta thinking that the subtle variations between each characters gives Quake the complexity it needs to justify a new game in 2017.At least, it's my very earliest impression that the heroes are helping the game. Quake Champions is still about who is the most adept at strafe jumping and mouse aiming, but now the character variances adds an educational buffer to that skill ceiling.What I mean by that is when you come across an opponent, you now have to consider their ultimate ability and their custom health stats. And that is something you can only really learn through experience. If you go to kill Anarki, the transhuman punk, you have to keep in mind that he is faster than anyone else and can gain speed during strafe jumps thanks to his passive ability. So if you're used to leading characters with the rail gun, you'll have to adjust that for Anarki.Now, I don't know if I'd flat-out say that having heroes is better than having each person playing as a blank slate, but I do think that having this variety and learning curve will hold my attention for a longer period of time. It gives me something to learn while I'm subconsciously improving my other skills and understanding of the maps. That should keep me playing longer than if I just had to keep throwing myself into the grinder to improve my fundamental skills.But despite any of these modern additions, Quake Champions is still Quake at its core. If Fatal1ty picks up the game, he's probably not gonna have to learn the idiosyncrasies of every character to outplay the rest of us. If you're like me, and you are mediocre with a mouse at best, you may appreciate the game giving you a chance to succeed through knowledge instead of your hand coordination alone. And if this isn't for you, well, you can always go enjoy some Quake Live.",

    "content": "Diane Bryant, head of Intel's Data Center Group, is taking a leave of absence for the next six to eight months to attend to a personal family matter.Bryant has been one of the most prominent female leaders at Intel as head of the company's Data Center Group. Her business generated $4.2 billion in revenue last quarter, or about 28 percent of its revenue. But the server chips that the division generates are among the highest-profit products that Intel makes.She will be replaced by Navin Shenoy, who will become general manager of DCG on an interim basis. You could say this is a blow to diversity -- albeit a temporary one -- at Intel, where the topic has been a big priority.In a comment, an Intel spokesperson said, \"This has no effect on Intel's commitment to diversity and inclusion or our diversity initiative, which aims to enhance and encourage more diversity at Intel and in the technology industry.  When she returns in six to eight months, Diane will take on her next challenging business role, and will continue to pursue her passion of championing diversity and changing the pipeline based on strong science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education.\"In an email today, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced changes to the company's leadership team:Today I'm writing to share two important leadership transitions on our executive leadership team.Diane Bryant has made the difficult decision to take a leave of absence from Intel to tend to a personal family matter. She is stepping away for the next six to eight months. Given the extended duration, an interim leader for the Data Center Group (DCG) is not possible. As a result, I have asked Navin Shenoy to take the position of general manager of DCG.DCG is a central part of our transformation and corporate strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution. Over the past five years, Diane has transformed DCG from a server-centric group to a business that spans servers, network and storage across all end-user segments, and with product lines and business models that extend beyond the traditional. DCG's leading products and strategies -- driving industry transformations' to pervasive cloud computing, virtualization of network infrastructure, and adoption of artificial intelligence solutions -- have positioned the business to be the growth driver for Intel. I want to thank Diane for her outstanding leadership and I will announce her next role upon her return.Navin will now report to me in this role. Since joining Intel in 1995, Navin has held leadership roles in the CEO's office, sales and marketing, and the PC and tablet businesses. Most recently, as general manager of the Client Computing Group (CCG), he was responsible for the P&L, strategy and product development. Information about the succession plan for Navin as the general manager of CCG will be provided over the coming weeks. In the interim, Murthy Renduchintala will be CCG's acting leader.Navin and Diane have been instrumental to Intel's success and our executive leadership team over the past few years. They will work closely together for the next month to ensure a smooth transition for the organization and our customers.Management changes can be distracting, but it is critical that we all give Navin, Diane and the CCG leadership team our full support during this transition and focus on delivering leadership products and executing flawlessly. And, it goes without saying that my thoughts are with Diane. I look forward to welcoming her back to her next challenging role.",

    "title": "Slack's updated search helps find the right team member to answer your question",
    "content": "Slack has launched a feature designed to elevate how you search for information in the team chat and productivity app. Instead of querying by messages, you can now look things up by people and channel, a capability developed through the company's Search Learning & Intelligence (SLI) group.Above: Slack new search feature lets you find the right teammate that has answers to your questions.Available for paying customers that have teams of more than 50 members, this advanced search feature provides a new way of finding information, based on knowledge that coworkers and team members may possess. Instead of looking up messages about the company's \"hiring process,\" for example, you can now find colleagues who frequently discuss that topic and can even locate the public channels where it's being mentioned.This could come in handy when you're interested in something topical but don't know the exact phrase to use.While Slack said this feature is for teams that are either on the standard, plus, or enterprise plans, it'll also be effective for those in large companies, an area where Slack is slowly making advances. Isaiah Greene, the company's product lead for SLI, told VentureBeat: \"The idea behind the number 50 is that teams of that size will have knowledge spread widely enough for authoritative experts to exist, and for people to need help finding them -- teams that are smaller will likely benefit less.\"Slack claimed that the more intelligent search option will only parse through public channels and will not include any bot messages. It's also currently only available on the desktop.This is one of a few tools that SLI plans on releasing in the near future, including prioritized reading, channel highlights, and daily briefings, all of which were previewed earlier this year. Slack declined to provide specific timelines for public release. All of these tools are aimed at reducing information overload.\"There's a lot of information out there for you and your team to keep up with,\" Greene explained. \"Oftentimes, you may not know where to start searching or who you can reach out to to help move work forward. Search in Slack now shows you the people and channels most likely to be of help to your query so you can quickly get the information you need and do your best work.\"This addition helps Slack move closer to its goal of developing a work graph, something the SLI group has been tasked with. Eventually, the use of machine learning could better organize all the knowledge within a company to provide a \"more personalized, intelligent version\" to every team member. Greene touted that you can now \"get instant answers to your questions, powered by the collective knowledge of your company.\"",

    "content": "(Reuters) -- Facebook Inc will hire 3,000 more people over the next year to respond to reports of inappropriate material on the social media network and speed up the removal of videos showing murder, suicide and other violent acts, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday.The hiring spree is an acknowledgment by Facebook that, at least for now, it needs more than automated software to improve monitoring of posts. Facebook Live, a service that allows any user to broadcast live, has been marred since its launch last year by instances of people streaming violence.Zuckerberg, the company's co-founder, said in a Facebook post the workers will be in addition to the 4,500 people who already review posts that may violate its terms of service.Last week, a father in Thailand broadcast himself killing his daughter on Facebook Live, police said. After more than a day, and 370,000 views, Facebook removed the video. Other videos from places such as Chicago and Cleveland have also shocked viewers with their violence.Zuckerberg said: \"We're working to make these videos easier to report so we can take the right action sooner - whether that's responding quickly when someone needs help or taking a post down.\"The 3,000 workers will be new positions and will monitor all Facebook content, not just live videos, the company said. The company did not say where the jobs would be located.Facebook is due to report quarterly revenue and earnings later on Wednesday after markets close in New York.The world's largest social network, with 1.9 billion monthly users, has been turning to artificial intelligence to try to automate the process of finding pornography, violence and other potentially offensive material. In March, the company said it planned to use such technology to help spot users with suicidal tendencies and get them assistance.However, Facebook still relies largely on its users to report problematic material. It receives millions of reports from users each week, and like other large Silicon Valley companies, it relies on thousands of human monitors to review the reports.\"Despite industry claims to the contrary, I don't know of any computational mechanism that can adequately, accurately, 100 percent do this work in lieu of humans. We're just not there yet technologically,\" said Sarah Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA who looks at content monitoring.The workers who monitor material generally work on contract in places such as India and the Philippines, and they face difficult working conditions because of the hours they spend making quick decisions while sifting through traumatic material, Roberts said in an interview.(Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Jeffrey Benkoe and Bill Rigby)",

    "title": "Amazon and Red Hat collaborate to bridge data centers",
    "content": "One issue for Fortune 500 companies in the modern tech era is figuring out how to build and run their own software in the most productive way. Is it with their own data centers? Or in data centers run by a third-party public cloud company? Or is it a combination?Given that nearly all companies -- including those that build physical goods like appliances, cars, and airplanes -- have to craft their own custom software to do their jobs, this is a big issue.That's why Red Hat and Amazon say they want to make it easier for corporate developers to use Red Hat's development software, which can run in-house to tap into databases and other services in Amazon's cloud as well. A corporate developer could mix and match software services running on the company's own servers or \"out there\" on Amazon Web Services to get the best of both worlds.\"There's a lot of innovation on AWS. This makes OpenShift more attractive to more developers, but it's also a storefront for Amazon features and products,\" Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst told Fortune during an interview at the Red Hat Summit tech conference in Boston. Whitehurst said he started discussing this plan with AWS chief executive Andy Jassy in January.Red Hat is not alone in trying to woo corporate users with better ties to AWS. Last fall, VMware and Amazon said they were working on a way to deploy VMware workloads on AWS, for example.Amazon is the largest public cloud, with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform generally considered the other top contenders. If a business is thinking of moving some data or workloads to a public cloud -- basically a massive array of servers, storage, and networking owned and managed by one company -- AWS is almost always on the short list.To be clear, AWS services run in Amazon's cloud data centers only. But as Red Hat noted in its press release, OpenShift software customers will be able to configure and deploy AWS database, data warehouse and other services \"with just few clicks from directly within the Red Hat OpenShift console.\"The OpenShift integration is an extension of an existing alliance. Customers have been able to run the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system on AWS for a decade. And they could already buy and run OpenShift itself on AWS, as they can on Azure and Google Cloud Platform. The difference here is deeper integration between OpenShift running on customer premises and AWS services running on, well, AWS.And given Red Hat's prominence among big companies -- most of which use Red Hat's version of the Linux operating system -- it also gives AWS a better hybrid cloud story. Many companies still balk at the notion of putting a ton of their workloads on any one cloud, fearing lock-in. They might be more comfortable using many clouds in what is called a hybrid cloud model, or keep running some jobs in-house. In theory, OpenShift, which runs on a bunch of clouds, as well as on premises, lets them hedge that bet.\"Developers today don't really have to know or care where various services are running,\" said Matt Hicks, Red Hat vice president of engineering, told Fortune. But they do want a single place to manage and monitor those services. Red Hat clearly hopes OpenShift will be that place.As for other public cloud providers, Michael Ferris, vice president of technical business development, said that IBM Bluemix is also a large partner. \"The announcements you see us do reflect customer demand, but our overall intent through our CCSD program is make sure we can partner at all levels.\" (CCSD is Red Hat's Certified Cloud and Service Provider program.)As to whether Red Hat will offer similar OpenShift integration with Microsoft and Google, Paul Cormier, Red Hat's president of products and technologies, said: \"All three are strong partners, and you can expect progression on all three constantly although there's nothing to announce.\"This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.

    "content": "Picking apples may seem like a fun weekend activity, but it's actually backbreaking manual labor. Abundant Robotics wants to help agricultural growers shoulder this task and today announced funding of $10 million, led by GV, to commercialize its apple-picking robot.Apple growers generate about $50 billion in revenue globally, yet the apple picking process hasn't undergone any significant change in the last 100 years, says Abundant Robotic's cofounder and CEO, Dan Steere. \"Today, agricultural workers pick apples wearing a bag with shoulder straps that can weigh between 45 to 60 pounds,\" he told VentureBeat in an interview. \"And the labor pool of folks that are willing to do this work is shrinking.\"Enter the apple-picking robot. The initial idea sprang out of SRI International, which provided research funding alongside the Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission. Abundant Robotics spun out of SRI in 2016 to begin working on the final prototype.The robot uses computer vision to recognize ripe apples and a vacuum system to pick them -- its arms can reach the top of a tree. \"Modern apple orchards use dwarf trees, which are supported by trellis structures that range from 10 to 14 feet tall,\" said Steere. Agriculture workers will manage the robot remotely to pick the apples.Steer claims that although there is a lot of research interest in agricultural automation, Abundant Robotics is currently the only startup tackling this issue on a commercial level. Israel-based FFRobotics, however, is also working on a patented robotic fruit harvester. Broader agricultural automation includes Bosch's weed-killing robot.New investors BayWa AG and Tellus Partners joined GV in today's round. Existing investors Yamaha Motor Company, KPCB Edge, and Comet Labs also participated. Abundant Robotics will use the new capital to commercialize the technology and is targeting next year for the release. Steere would not disclose the price at this point. The startup targets the U.S. market and plans on applying the technology to other fruit-picking industries in the future.Based in Hayward, California, Abundant Robotics currently has eight employees.",

Kurt Beidler, the company's director of kids and family, once told VentureBeat that the goal is to \"help kids be independent, play, explore, and learn without help from their parents.\" Amazon believes that caretakers will value the peace of mind of knowing that their children won't be exposed to violence, inappropriate content, or excessive screen time when using FreeTime.More than 10 million kids have currently signed up for the service, which previously was available on Amazon's Fire tablets, Kindle e-readers, and on the Fire TV.The expansion into other Android devices comes weeks after the company launched a parental dashboard and discussion cards to encourage conversation with children about what they're reading, watching, and learning. But while it's more accessible now, FreeTime is still limited to the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.Those with existing subscriptions to Amazon FreeTime's premium service can access their account on Android devices for free.",

The company, founded in 2013, now manages more than 1 billion mobile users and processes more than 250 billion API calls monthly.In short, mParticle now lets you connect both your data and that of a partner to its \"API for growth,\" which in turn lets you use mParticle's full range of features across both data sets at the same time.That means one set of analytics, one place to create audience segments, one location for split testing, and one dashboard for monetization.\"You have that continuum of scale and quality,\" Michael Katz, mParticle cofounder and CEO, told me. \"First-party data has the highest quality. Third-party data has scale, but can be much lower in quality. By bringing partner data into the platform, you're allowing for scale but without losing the quality of the data.\"It is not just a smart move for mParticle's customers, but also for mParticle itself. By allowing brands to connect partner data to the mParticle product, the company is opening itself up to customer referrals.\"We see this as a natural evolution of our platform,\" Katz said. \"We have many brands on the platform that are already transacting with other brands. If we can help to make that easier for them to do that in a privacy-friendly and secure environment, then we see that as a win-win situation.\"Security and privacy is of the utmost importance when sharing data, of course. In mParticle's solution, data is fully encrypted, and the exchanging parties must explicitly consent to the peer-to-peer data-sharing functionality. Once opted in, both parties must agree to governing terms and may choose to accept or reject the data being shared. Of course, brands still need to ensure they are conforming to local data-sharing regulations.\"We're the platform,\" Katz said. \"We're enabling two parties that must get the explicit consent from their users, either in their terms of service or by some other means, in order to share data with third parties.\"mParticle's new P2P functionality is available from today.",

    "title": "Uber to fight for the right to continue its self-driving car program",
    "content": "(Reuters) -- Uber Technologies Inc goes before a U.S. judge on Wednesday to fight for the right to continue work on its self-driving car program, the latest phase in a courtroom battle over trade secrets that threatens to topple a central pillar of Uber's growth strategy.The ride-services company is contesting a lawsuit by Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit, Waymo, which accused former Waymo engineer and current Uber executive Anthony Levandowski of taking technical secrets from Waymo and using them to help Uber's self-driving car development.If it were proven that Levandowski and Uber conspired in taking the information, that could have dire consequences for Uber, say legal and ride-hailing industry experts. Uber's $68 billion valuation is propped up in part by investors' belief it will be a dominant player in the emerging business of self-driving cars.At issue on Wednesday is Waymo's demand that U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup in San Francisco issue an injunction barring Uber from using any of the technology that Waymo said was stolen. If Alsup issues a broadly worded order against Uber, it could all but shut down Uber's self-driving car program while court proceedings continue.Alsup is not expected to rule immediately on Wednesday, but he may intimate which way he is leaning. At a hearing last month, Alsup warned Uber that it may face an injunction, saying of the evidence amassed by Waymo: \"I've never seen a record this strong in 42 years.\"Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick has said that autonomous vehicles, though still in their infancy, are critical to the company's long-term success and future growth.Indeed, autonomous cars promise to change the economics of the ride-hailing business. Among Uber's biggest expenses is the cost of attracting drivers, who have a high turnover rate. And Uber's ability to expand into suburban and rural markets, and areas with low vehicle ownership, and continue to offer a ride within three minutes, largely hinges on the availability of a network of self-driving vehicles.\"This is central to Uber,\" said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University and author of the book \"The Sharing Economy,\" noting that Uber has more at stake than some of its rivals.\"If Google can't launch their self-driving car for 10 years instead of five, this will be a little blip in Google's multibillion-dollar revenue. Uber is the one that really depends on it.\"Uber has faced a string of setbacks in recent months, including allegations of sexual harassment from a former employee and the public release of a video of Kalanick berating an Uber driver. The company, though still growing strongly, is losing hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter, according to information the company released last month.\"Any big setback here would likely hit its valuation hard,\" said Jan Dawson, an Uber analyst with Jackdaw Research. A blanket ban on Uber's autonomous efforts \"would certainly stall its efforts for a while and put it even further behind Waymo and others.\"Uber has self-driving tests underway in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Arizona. It started work on the technology six years after Google began.Other industry watchers say that Uber, which has deep pockets and other value propositions such as huge swaths of traffic and rider data, could ride out a negative ruling in the Waymo case.The Waymo lawsuit, filed in February, revolves around a laser-based technology called Lidar that allows cars to \"see\" their surroundings and detect the location of other cars and pedestrians.Waymo said Levandowski, who until last week was head of Uber's self-driving car program, stole more than 14,000 confidential documents before leaving his job at Waymo in January 2016. He formed a self-driving truck startup, Otto, which Uber bought in August for $680 million.Uber has said Waymo's claims are false, and in a court filing called the preliminary injunction motion \"a misfire.\" Uber has not denied Levandowski took files from Waymo, but said it never possessed any of the confidential information that Waymo accused Levandowski of stealing.Levandowski himself has invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination because of the possibility of a future criminal probe. And last week, Levandowski said in an email to Uber employees he would stay at Uber but was stepping down from his work on Lidar.\"You're left to assume the worst,\" said Elizabeth Rowe, an intellectual property professor at University of Florida Levin College of Law.In a deposition of Levandowski last month, attorneys for Waymo also probed Levandowski about Kalanick, whether the CEO encouraged him to take Waymo's confidential material, according to a court transcript. Levandowski invoked the Fifth Amendment.A spokesman for Uber declined to comment on the deposition.(Reporting by Heather Somerville and Dan Levine in San Francisco.; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Grant McCool)",

    "title": "Apple's China sales continue to decay as once promising market becomes a drag on earnings",
    "content": "China once represented Apple's great hope: a huge, booming market, a growing middle class, a great admiration of the Apple brand.Instead, as the latest quarterly earnings show, China has turned into one of the company's biggest headaches. And as time passes, things in China only seem to be getting worse for Apple, despite executives' protestations to the contrary.During the earnings call yesterday, CEO Tim Cook tried to sound optimistic about Apple's prospects in country. \"We continue to be very enthusiastic about our opportunity in China,\" he said.The reality for Apple, however, is that native Chinese brands are pulling ahead in the country. Huawei, Oppo, and Xiaomi now have more than 50 percent of the market, according to Canalys. They are sucking up all the oxygen from both Apple and Samsung in the smartphone market.As such, the numbers for Apple were grim yesterday.The company posted $10.7 billion in sales in China in the second quarter, down 14 percent from the same period one year ago. This was the fifth straight quarter of year-over-year declines in China for Apple. Two years ago, the company reported $16 billion in sales in the same quarter.Last year, people complained that year-over-year comparisons were unfair because Apple had a blockbuster year in China the year before that. But this time around, comparisons should have been easier, as one analyst noted during the earnings call. And still, sales were down.Cook himself said at one point that Apple had a pretty strong quarter, despite China. He said that the company grew in four of its five geographical segments. It had double-digit percentage growth in the U.S. and Europe. But the China problem limited the company's overall revenue growth to just 5 percent for the quarter.Cook tried to look on the bright side, noting that China revenue was only down 13 percent the first half of this fiscal year, compared to the 27 percent drop the second half of the last fiscal year. Of course, the first half comes loaded with the new phone cycle, so it's not entirely comparable.He also talked up the company's retail stores. After the U.S., China has the second most Apple Stores in the world. Cook said the company had \"great results,\" with total store revenue up 27 percent in China, though it's unclear how many new stores the company opened there last year. Some stores had a 7 percent increase in revenue, he said.\"And now seven of our top ten highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China,\" Cook said. \"And so that's the set of things that went in our direction, so to speak.\"Cook also blamed the 5 percent currency devaluation and the weak Hong Kong economy.\"We did perform about where I thought we would,\" he said of China. \"At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but improve -- but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there.\"\"Not back to growth.\" It's not exactly clear what will get Apple back to growth in China, where it has made a massive investment. Perhaps the new iPhones in the fall will do the trick. But those homegrown smartphone brands are likely going to retain a big pricing advantage.For the moment, it seems that Apple is going to face a rougher long-term ride in China than it was originally expecting.",

After a gradual rollout across the U.S., the web service finally landed in all 50 U.S. states back in March.By meshing together data from Google Maps and Google Earth, Google uses 3D models and machine learning to estimate whether the position and location of a house has the potential to collect solar energy, and thus whether solar is a worthy investment for a homeowner. The tool looks at how much sun hits a roof and the position of the roof, while also factoring in historical weather data, shading from nearby objects, and the position of the sun at different times of the year.Above: Project SunroofFor the German launch of Project Sunroof, Google has partnered with E.ON and a software company called Tetraeder, and Google said that roughly seven million German homes are currently covered by the program.

    "content": "Agolo, a New York-based startup that's setting out to help companies fight information overload through AI-powered summarizations, has closed a $3.5 million seed round of funding co-led by Microsoft's corporate investment fund, Microsoft Ventures, and CRV, with participation from Point72 Ventures and Franklin Templeton.Founded in 2012, Agolo in its original guise was all about helping users curate their Twitter feed to focus on tweets and conversations that were most relevant to their preferences. But that early beta, it seems, was more of a proof of concept, showing how it's possible to crunch vast swathes of information to zoom in on the data that matters most. And so today Agolo is pitched as the \"world's most advanced summarization software,\" connecting news, documents, data, and more to create real-time summaries more quickly.Above: Summarization ExampleUsing natural language processing (NLP), Agolo's technology analyzes content, identifies different subjects, and draws connections between them. The company said that it already works with \"the world's largest media companies\" to help them summarize their news on Facebook and through Amazon's Alexa voice assistant.\"Summarization is essentially algorithmic reading and writing of content, which is as much a pillar of artificial intelligence as it is of human intelligence,\" said Sage Wohns, CEO and cofounder of Agolo. \"There's a crucial need for making sense of the world's information and Agolo is filling that void. Our platform partnerships with our investors have helped us become indispensable to media companies -- it's hard to find a media company we don't work with. And there are broader applications in diverse sectors, including financial services.\"Algorithms and AI are increasingly infiltrating the creative realm. Companies similar to Agolo include Automated Insights, which is using automation to analyze big data and transform it into stories, like sports reporting, while Narrative Science focuses on business intelligence for the enterprise, or \"data storytelling,\" as it puts it, enabling automated earnings reports created from data.Agolo has raised a number of smaller seed rounds of funding before now, but with its latest cash injection the company said it now plans to \"transform the way financial service analysts do their jobs\" by expanding its platform to cater to asset managers and investment banks.\"This is game-changing for those whose livelihoods depend on data accuracy and speed to action to make high stakes decisions,\" continued Mohamed AlTantawy, CTO and cofounder of Agolo. \"Defeating information overload creates a serious advantage for long/short equity analysts. End users receive personalized market and business intelligence reports so they don't have to spend countless hours reading through the same information.\"Moving forward, Agolo noted that it plans to integrate its summarization smarts into additional platforms, such as Slack, as well as chat, voice, and video.Microsoft Ventures' involvement in this funding round is also a major coup for Agolo, and comes just five months after it set up a new AI-focused fund, which made its inaugural investment in Montreal-based Element AI, while just yesterday Microsoft Ventures joined a $7.6 million round into AI startup Bonsai. It's worth noting here, however, that the Agolo investment came from Microsoft Ventures' main pot, not the AI-focused fund.\"The ability for humans to process mass amounts of information quickly is extremely limited, making summarization key to digesting data efficiently,\" noted Nagraj Kashyap, corporate vice president at Microsoft Ventures. \"We're excited to continue working with Agolo in its quest to fight information overload with AI, ultimately helping to make people and organizations more productive.\"  ",

    "content": "(Reuters) -- Microsoft Corp's announcement of a suite of new education products on Tuesday shows the company's determination to reverse a major shift that has taken place in U.S. classrooms in recent years: for most educators and school districts, Google's Chromebook is now the computer of choice.The Chromebook has gone from a standing start in 2011 to wild popularity in the market for education technology, which tech companies have traditionally viewed as a critical way to win over the next generation of users.In 2016, mobile devices running Alphabet Inc's Google's Chrome operating system accounted for 58 percent of the U.S. market for primary and secondary schools, according to Futuresource Consulting.The Microsoft products introduced Tuesday, including a new version of its Windows operating system, software to boost collaboration among students and a new Surface laptop, clearly show the influence of the Chromebook, industry watchers say.\"The success of the Chromebook has awakened sleeping giants,\" said Tyler Bosmeny, CEO of Clever, an education technology company. \"There's so much investment into the space -- it's unlike anything I've ever seen.\"For years after the release of the Chromebook in 2011, Apple Inc and Microsoft stuck to their strategies of offering slightly modified and discounted versions of their products for educators.But the Chromebook's low price -- it starts at $149 -- and easy management proved irresistible to many schools. Google also saw a key chance to expand its market share several years ago with the approach of an online testing mandate in the United States.To capitalize on the opportunity, the company created a \"test mode,\" which restricts access to the rest of the web while students complete assessments, said Rajen Sheth, a senior director of product management at Google.The preparations paid off: Sales of the Chromebook jumped tenfold between 2012 and 2013, Sheth said.While Google manufactures some Chromebooks, the devices aimed at the education market are supplied by partners such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Acer Inc. The operating system is free for educators and hardware manufacturers, and Google sells schools an education package including device management and support for a $30 fee.For Microsoft, Tuesday's event was the culmination of a campaign to emulate key aspects of the Chromebook strategy, said Mike Fisher, associate director for the education division at Futuresource Consulting.Microsoft's hardware partners are now selling hybrid tablet-laptop devices based on the Surface design starting at $189. Microsoft executives boasted that the operating system announced Tuesday boots up rapidly, a hallmark of the Chromebook.The company also introduced a new code-builder addition to its Minecraft education edition to help students learn coding skills through the popular game.For Microsoft, the test will be how easily it can explain its offering to educators, Fisher said.\"The Google education ecosystem is quite straightforward,\" he said. \"With Microsoft, there's a lot of moving parts.\"Microsoft declined to comment.Apple, for its part, has lowered the price of the iPad to $299 for education customers and made it possible for students to share devices, in addition to simplifying management.\"It's about trying to reach every teacher and every student,\" said Susan Prescott, a vice president of product management and marketing at Apple.Despite Google's U.S. dominance, its position is weaker in classrooms overseas, where many markets have not yet seen an impetus to embrace technology en masse, said Fisher of Futuresource Consulting.In 2016, devices running Android and Chrome made up 23 percent of the mobile market outside the United States, compared with 65 percent for Microsoft's Windows, according to Futuresource.(Reporting by Julia Love in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Lisa Shumaker)",

    "content": "(Reuters) -- The U.S. National Security Agency collected more than 151 million records of Americans' phone calls last year, even after Congress limited its ability to collect bulk phone records, according to an annual report issued on Tuesday by the top U.S. intelligence officer.The report from the office of Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was the first measure of the effects of the 2015 USA Freedom Act, which limited the NSA to collecting phone records and contacts of people U.S. and allied intelligence agencies suspect may have ties to terrorism.It found that the NSA collected the 151 million records even though it had warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court to spy on only 42 terrorism suspects in 2016, in addition to a handful identified the previous year.The NSA has been gathering a vast quantity of telephone \"metadata,\" records of callers' and recipients' phone numbers and the times and durations of the calls - but not their content - since the September 11, 2001, attacks.The report came as Congress faced a decision on whether to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which permits the NSA to collect foreign intelligence information on non-U.S. persons outside the United States, and is scheduled to expire at the end of this year.Privacy advocates have argued that Section 702 permits the NSA to spy on Internet and telephone communications of Americans without warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and that foreign intelligence could be used for domestic law enforcement purposes in a way that evades traditional legal requirements.The report said that on one occasion in 2016, the FBI obtained information about an American in response to a search of Section 702 data intended to produce evidence of a crime not related to foreign intelligence.The report did not address how frequently the FBI obtained information about Americans while investigating a foreign intelligence matter, however.On Friday, the NSA said it had stopped a form of surveillance that allowed it to collect the digital communications of Americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages without a warrant.The new report also came amid allegations, recently repeated by U.S. President Donald Trump, that former President Barack Obama ordered warrantless surveillance of his communications and that former national security adviser Susan Rice asked the NSA to unmask the names of U.S. persons caught in the surveillance.Both Republican and Democratic members of the congressional intelligence committees have said that so far they have found no evidence to support either allegation.Officials on Tuesday argued that the 151 million records collected last year were tiny compared with the number collected under procedures that were stopped after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed the surveillance program in 2013.Because the 151 million would include multiple calls made to or from the same phone numbers, the number of people whose records were collected also would be much smaller, the officials said. They said they had no breakdown of how many individuals' phone records were among those collected.In all, according to the report, U.S. officials unmasked the names of fewer Americans in NSA eavesdropping reports in 2016 than they did the previous year, the top U.S. intelligence officer reported on Tuesday.The report said the names of 1,934 \"U.S. persons\" were \"unmasked\" last year in response to specific requests, compared with 2,232 in 2015, but it did not identify who requested the names or on what grounds.Officials said in the report that U.S. intelligence agencies had gone out of their way to make public more information about U.S. electronic eavesdropping.\"This year's report continues our trajectory towards greater transparency, providing additional statistics beyond what is required by law,\" said Office of the Director of National Intelligence spokesman Timothy Barrett.(Additional reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by John Walcott and Jonathan Oatis)",

    "content": "You don't always need a ton of time to get your point across.The cure for sequelitis. Expanding gaming to India. Finding motivation to keep making games in a scary world. These are some important points brought up during GamesBeat Summit 2017's Lightning Round.In Berkley, California, five game professionals took the stage to make cases for topics important to them. In a normal GamesBeat session, a speaker has 20 minutes or 30 minutes to talk. The Lightning Round, which Super Ventures partner Tom Emrich hosted, gives each participant only five minutes.But that was more than enough time for these presenters to make an impression.Above: Raheel Hasan, CEO of 1app.com, at GamesBeat Summit 2017.Raheel Hasan is the chief executive officer at 1app, which wants to change the way people access apps. That's something that hasn't really changed much in the past 10 years. You still have to go to a store and download them. 1app's Goal is to make apps instantly available without requiring downloads or installs.Instead of having to go to a store to discover an app or clinking a link that directs you to the app's store page, 1app can have users open them directly from a link. And these links can appear anywhere. You could message a friend a link that starts up a game, or it could appear inside another app. This could shrink the barrier to learning about new games.Above: Ravi Belwal of Samsung at GamesBeat Summi 2017.Ravi Belwal works at Samsung, helping to build a market in the Southeast Asia region for the Galaxy brand. Belwal said that the area's mobile outlook is booming. Android is king, netting 90 percent of downloads. But iOS is still seeing a lot of revenues from its 10 percent.Many of the customers in the region want western game. People will ask when Clash of Clans is coming. Belwal encouraged developers to bring their games to Southeast Asia, noting that localization is easy as most citizens of these countries speak English.Belwal also brought up India, noting that it is the sleeping giant in mobile gaming with its population of over 1 billion. Right now, many Indians are downloading games, but these aren't earning revenues. Belwal said that the revenues will come, maybe as soon as 2019.Above: Robin Hunicke, chief executive officer of Funomena, at GamesBeat Summit 2017.Robin Hunicke is a chief executive officer of Funomena, a independent game studio based in San Francisco. Her message was one of encouragement that she presented as an open letter. She told the audience that focusing on game development can be hard in our changing and scary society. But she said that games are a place where the weird is celebrated, and children look up to game makers and want to be them.\"Your work is the work that makes our industry grow,\" Hunicke said. \"You matter, your work matters.\"She encouraged everyone to remain creative and to keep making games.Above: Deanna Tezian, president CurriculaWorks, at GamesBeat Summit 2017.Deanna Tezian is the president of the educational gaming company CurriculaWorks. Her company made a game for the military that promoted brain training. It also happened to involve shooting zombies. But Tezian said that it helped users engage in the game. Making it exciting and fun made them more likely to train for longer hours.She argued that schools need to take a similar approach. Games like The Oregon Trail might seem educational, but they aren't actually teaching much. Schools need to obsess less with the content of the game and more on its effectiveness. Just throwing numbers and letters into something doesn't make it an efficient teaching tool.Above: Justin Bailey, CEO of Fig, at GamesBeat Summit 2017.Justin Bailey, the chief executive officer of Fig, talked about sequel fatigue, or sequelitis. This is when developers depend too much on the same franchises. It's how we get dozens of Call of Duties and Assassin's Creed. Mobile suffers the same problem, with Candy Crush Saga and Angry Birds turning into their own mega franchises.But sequelitis has a cure, Bailey argued. Right now, we see the same franchises because games are expensive to make, which makes publishers scared to take risks. This leads to greenlighting committees only approving safe bets. But these days, the community can greenlight projects. Something like this is happening at Netflix. It saw that its users were watching The West Wing, so Netflix greenlit House of Cards.Studios can also have more creative freedom is they have multiple sources of funding, something that the film industry discovered some time ago. If you have one big investor, you're beholden to them. If you have multiple smaller investors, you don't have to answer to any one group.",

    "title": "How the game industry tackles diversity and personal failure",
    "content": "A diverse workforce is meaningless if you don't use their perspectives to shape and enhance your games.This is one of the biggest takeaways from a presentation about diversity and leadership at the GamesBeat Summit in Berkeley, California (watch it here). Moderator Guy Bendov, the chief executive of Side-Kick Games, said the panel was partly a reaction to world events, especially in the aftermath of a fraught U.S. presidential election and the controversial travel ban proposals from the Trump administration.At one point, Bendov asked the panelists what they learned from moments of failure. Rami Ismail, the cofounder of the two-person independent studio Vlambeer and frequent speaker at game conferences around the world, had a cautionary tale. In 2011, he traveled to South Africa to speak at a local game development school for kids.\"At the end there was a Q&A for the students. One of the students, being somewhat cheeky, asked me whether they should drop out of school, which is a question I get a lot,\" said Ismail. \"I've learned to answer that question in a very safe way: 'That's a personal decision. You're the only one who knows the circumstances of your life. But if you have to ask me, I'd generally recommend not to do it. This has to be your own choice. Some people learn better outside of school.'\"I told the kid that and the teacher ... afterward grabbed me and said, 'If you ever do that again, you're never coming back to the school.' And I was shocked because I've always seen that as the safe . It turns out that, if a student drops out of Johannesburg, South Africa, the consequences are very different from the consequences you would have in the Netherlands [where Ismail is from].\"Disney executive producer Asra Rasheed had to overcome the traditional values of her culture as she rose through the corporate world. As a South Asian woman (her father immigrated from India to Oklahoma), she grew up with the idea that women are supposed to \"respect their elders, speak softly, and don't cause too much of a scene.\"Above: Asra Rasheed (far left) at the diversity panel.Her struggle with this came up in an anecdote about her time as CEO of educational company Reading Rainbow, where she was also the business partner of TV host LeVar Burton. One year, she and Burton were walking around at the Electronic Entertainment Expo trade show.\"Somebody came up to him, looked at me, then looked at LeVar and said, 'Can I schedule an appointment with your admin here?' And he pointed to me,\" Rasheed told the audience. \"LeVar looked at me, and I kept quiet. That was a mistake. I should've said something. I didn't.\"LeVar looked at me and looked at him and said, 'She's my fucking CEO!' And that was pretty awesome. ... What my personal -- I don't want to say failure -- but it's something that I learned from: have a voice at the table wherever you're at. I didn't have that voice at times where I should've, particularly at fundraising.\"Over time, Rasheed learned to have her voice heard and assert herself.On the topic of what leaders can do to value diversity, Ismail said a lot of the good leaders recognize that they're still privileged, like the fact they speak English and live in a country that has a healthy economy. It's also important that they recruit people with intent, and focus on the long-term culture of their organization over the short-term view of profits.\"People that do good work in the diversity space tend to understand that in the long term, having diverse perspectives, having different types of people will make their organization stronger,\" said Ismail.Asi Burak, chief executive of consulting firm Power Play, added that it's important for leaders to be optimistic, which isn't easy nowadays. Instead of keeping their heads down, leaders should believe in their ability to make changes, especially now.",

    "title": "PlayStation interns turned the 'Minority Report' touch gloves into a reality",
    "content": "You don't get something like PlayStation VR without a lot of experimentation. And sometimes the origins of those experiments are as obvious as you think they are.The PlayStation Magic Lab research-and-development team has built dozens of hardware and software prototypes over the years, and one of those includes the weird touch-control glove that Tom Cruise's character John Anderton uses to interface with his computer system in Minority Report. In a discussion at the GamesBeat Summit event in Berkeley, California, today, Magic Lab boss Richard Marks talked about how these ideas turn into consumer products after beginning life in his workshop.\"That's really why we get up in the morning in my group is to turn science fiction into reality,\" said Marks. \"We've created a lot of different prototypes. One was generated by our interns. They saw the movie Minority Report -- and the next morning they built this thing to do the same kind of input for a game system.\"Now, of course Sony has never released a version of those gloves for consumers, but a lot of the tech that went into building the PlayStation VR system started in the Magic Lab. Marks shared about the process of how the work he does feeds into a final product.\"Our researchers all care a lot about games,\" said Marks. \"They play a lot of games, and we know the game teams pretty intimately -- so we talk to them all the time. We know what they're interested in or what they're being held back by. So we'll make a prototype, and then we might show it internally to our game teams. We also might take it to a conference or to academic researchers. And we get feedback from those groups.\"Based on that input from forces within Sony and external to the company, Marks and his staff will decide to either do more prototyping for an idea, to hand off a concept to someone else, or to move onto something else. While the Minority Report gloves are an example of an idea that the company mostly abandoned, the company frequently hands off its work to other teams.Marks gave an example of a virtual reality concept Magic Lab built for the Hollywood film The Walk. His team came up with a bunch of the fundamental ideas inspired by that movie, and then TriStar (a subsidiary of Sony Pictures) took that early work and turned it into a product for consumers. You can now play The Walk Virtual Reality Experience on PlayStation VR.And while Marks loves when Magic Lab ideas reach the public, he does acknowledge it can hurt to give up on certain projects.\"It can be difficult if you invest a lot of your time as a researcher, and then it doesn't end up going past some point -- it's a difficult thing to let go and realize it's just not the right thing for your company,\" said Marks. \"But sometimes those ideas do come back later, so it's not always a bad thing.\"I doubt, however, that those Minority Report gloves are one of those things we can expect to make a return.",

That's down 13 percent from a year ago.The addition of bigger iPads, iPads with Pencil, iPad corporate partnerships to write software, iPad with anything ... none of it seems to be helping the gadget that many of us once thought was going to make us forget about laptops and desktop computers. Nope.To find sales numbers that low, you have to go all the way back to the second quarter of 2011, when it sold 4.69 million units. By that point, the gadget had been on sale for about a year. The next quarter, sales jumped to 9.25 million units.

    "title": "The Philadelphia 76ers dish on what it's like to own an esports team",
    "content": "Even multimillion dollar basketball organizations don't have all the answers yet when it comes to expanding their businesses into competitive gaming.The worlds of esports and traditional sports collided yesterday at the GamesBeat Summit in Berkeley, California. In a panel with Team Dignitas chairman Greg Richardson and VP of strategy for the Philadelphia 76ers Akshay Khanna, both men talked about the crossover between their industries. What they found was that they still have a lot to learn from each other.Intelligence firm Newzoo predicts that esports will grow to a $696 million business this year, a number that helps explain why traditional sports are so interested in their digital counterparts. In September 2016, the NBA's 76ers became the first major North American sports franchise to have its own esports team. It actually acquired two separate squads -- Dignitas and Apex -- and merged them into one as Team Dignitas.They compete across five games: League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, and Smite. Around the same time, other NBA team owners and executives also invested into esports teams. Khanna recalled the moment when many leaders in the league first became aware of esports as a growing phenomenon.\"The conversation around esports began for our owners, who are investors by nature ... at an NBA board meeting, the commissioner and some of his folks were talking about esports and about the viewership numbers around competitive gaming,\" said Khanna. \"Everyone there has big egos, and no one was happy about people watching other people playing video games more than they're watching the NBA Finals.\"It's a staggering statistic that I think took a lot of owners ... a little bit by storm. That's really what began the process for us of learning about the industry and questioning whether we should invest there, but also what specific vehicle for investment.\"The 76ers believe they have the best marketing and sales team in traditional sports, and they plan to use that to help grow and monetize their esports business. Part of that is attracting big brands who haven't touched gaming and turn them into sponsors.\"They've been waiting to enter this world because they see the demographics the way we see the demographics,\" said Khanna. \"And for them, this is even more compelling because this group of individuals is so hard to target in any other form of entertainment or advertising.\"But the franchise still has a lot to learn. Khanna illustrated the gulf between the behaviors of traditional sports fans and esports fans with an amusing anecdote. When the Sixers entertain their special guests, they usually bring them to a live basketball game and have them watch from highly coveted courtside seats.That's what they did with a League of Legends player they wanted to recruit for Team Dignitas. But they had a problem: He wasn't really into basketball.\"We didn't necessarily get the same reaction that one typically gets from someone sitting courtside at a basketball game,\" said Khanna.It was the first NBA game that the player had ever been to -- yet it didn't stop him from just looking down at his phone the entire time. Khanna admitted that this bruised his ego a bit. However, he also realized just how much work they need to do to understand the esports audience, and how they consume content much differently than regular sports fans.",

    "title": "Twilio warns about Uber's waning usage of its platform",
    "content": "Twilio ($TWLO) is raising a flag to caution shareholders about a potential impact on future revenue. During the company's first quarter earnings call, chief executive Jeff Lawson warned about a change with one of Twilio's largest customers: Uber. He said that contributions from the on-demand ride hailing service has started to decrease, from 17 percent last quarter to 12 percent this quarter, and Twilio \"expects contributions to decline further\" -- it expects the associated revenue to drop sequentially and year over year.Lawson attributed the decline to Uber's growth, suggesting that there's a push to move some of the communication in-house. Uber currently uses Twilio for a variety of use cases, such as driver marketing and communication. Despite this, Twilio said that it believes \"Uber will remain an important customer moving forward\" while stating that it's due to Uber and WhatsApp being outliers rather than a sign about Twilio's stability.Today's news is an example of one of the risks the cloud-based telephony company warned against when it was going through the process of going public. When it filed in May 2016, Twilio disclosed that Facebook-owned WhatsApp accounted for 15 percent of its revenue for the first three months of 2016 with no long-term contract. Uber appeared to be the largest customer using the communication platform, accounting for 17 percent.The usage reduction by Uber was attributed to the fact that, because of the company's massive growth and reach worldwide, the service wound up being expensive, and thus Uber's management made a business decision to reduce dependency on Twilio's platform. \"It's the nature of the company and size of the spend for Uber to make this kind of decision,\" Lawson said, while denying that this was part of a growing trend investors should be worried about.He reiterated that besides WhatsApp and Uber, Twilio has \"very little customer concentration that follows.\" In fact, its third largest customer accounted for 2 percent of revenue.Twilio chief financial officer Lee Kirkpatrick said that the company forecasted \"modest growth\" by Uber in 2017, but has since reduced its expectations \"significantly.\" It's perhaps this adjustment that has resulted in Twilio updating its guidance, something that has caused shares in the company to tank after the release of its quarterly earnings.While the call did focus on Uber, Kirkpatrick denied any changes coming around WhatsApp usage.",

    "title": "Why the next evolution of AI will be a seamless methodology",
    "content": "Everyone and their mother is racing toward AI these days. Spending on the technology was already at a hefty $640 million in 2016, and analysts predict it'll reach $37 billion by 2025. While we're all ultimately working together, there's still fragmentation in the industry as competing schools of thought grapple for supremacy. How do you build a thinking machine?Thousands of developers have worked for decades to discover the right methodology to create machine learning and the singularity. Some believe neural networks are the key to unlocking AI's potential, while others are exploring probabilistic programming. Many more schools of thought exist, from fuzzy systems to evolutionary computation, chaos theory, Gaussian processes, computational creativity, and more -- all with their own supporters and detractors.Each group is certain its discipline holds the key to unlocking the mystery. But it's likely a combination of these technologies that will solve the puzzle. Not all human brains work the same, so why should every AI?With a neural network, an AI system -- such as Google's Assistant, Apple's Siri, or Amazon's Alexa -- creates a platform other third parties can tie into. The memory of the neural network increases as more simple systems are connected, allowing it to detect more patterns and appear smarter. When you ask your Google Pixel to play '80s music on Spotify, you're tapping into Google's neural network.Probabilistic programming creates intelligence by doing what its name suggests: letting reasoning, coupled with the probability of various outcomes, determine a solution.Both neural networks and probabilistic programming represent how the human mind works. Our minds have systems of information we can access to come up with conclusions. We analyze data, predict potential outcomes, and make decisions. A single individual learns, remembers, and draws conclusions in dozens of ways depending on which methodology is best suited for the decision at hand.Researchers are realizing it's the combination of all these disciplines that allows for a genuine thinking machine. Each has yielded amazing results independently, and by combining them, one technique's strengths augment another's weaknesses. A connectionist system, for example, requires huge amounts of properly tagged data to recognize what it sees, but probabilistic programming mitigates this concern.This approach solves one of the biggest problems facing AI: anticipating uncertainty.Even with AI getting so much buzz, jumping on board isn't as easy as you'd think. Unless your goal is to build a company that utilizes fuzzy systems or Gaussian processes, there's little way your specific website or application can create a viable input-output contribution to the discipline. There's still hope to join the fray, however, by following three simple steps:What's currently missing from the AI arms race is the combination of all these features. Saying \"OK Google, set up a date night for me and my wife\" will one day cover everything. The AI assistant will schedule an Uber, reserve a table at your favorite restaurant, find a movie you'll both enjoy, and even find a frozen yogurt place for dessert.No taps, swipes, or iFuss -- just a combination of every AI methodology integrated into one seamless experience. That's the next evolution of AI.Q Manning is CEO of Rocksauce Studios, which crafts custom mobile apps for all platforms.",

    "content": "One of Valve's most visible public faces has moved on from the company.Above: Faliszek (middle) with Valve founder Gabe Newell (left).Chet Faliszek, writer on games like the Half-Life episodes and Portal, left Valve more than a month ago. For over a decade, Faliszek worked at Valve as one of its primary storytellers. Most recently, however, he has worked as Valve's virtual reality ambassador. Faliszek would travel to events like the Game Developers Conference, Slush Play, and more to talk with developers about creating VR games and experiences on top of Valve's open SteamVR tech. While the company has experimented on VR for years internally, it was Faliszek who turned the company into one of the best communicators on how people could best approach the technology as creators.\"I was with Valve for 12-plus years,\" Faliszek said in a social media post. \"But [I was] a fan for even longer. Can't wait to play what is coming next.\"Faliszek did not say that Half-Life 3 is what is coming next. He also did not mention what he is doing next. On Twitter, he noted that he has spent the last month hanging out with his cats and not traveling.@willsmith Yep, I have actually been gone for almost a month - hence all the cat pictures and no travels.  #priorities...-- Chet Faliszek (@chetfaliszek) May 2, 2017Faliszek's exit from Valve comes after some other notable Valve writers have left the company. Portal co-writer Erik Wolpaw left in February, and Half-Life co-writer Marc Laidlaw departed in early 2016. Faliszek is also leaving more than six years since the release of Portal 2, which is Valve's last game that focused heavily on narrative and characters. The company now puts much more of its effort into running its live online games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2 as well as its Steam store for PC games.",

    "title": "L'Oreal beauty bot learns your style to make gift giving easier",
    "content": "L'Oreal has launched a bot named Beauty Gifter that asks both the gift giver and the recipient questions in order to sell personalized makeup and skin care gifts via Facebook Messenger.The bot was first made available in a soft launch last week.Beauty Gifter is one in a series of conversational experiences L'Oreal plans to create together with Automat Technologies, a Montreal-based startup that has operated primarily in stealth since its launch last year.Upcoming initiatives could include the use of in-store QR codes to promote conversational experiences, Automat CEO Andy Mauro told VentureBeat in a phone interview.\"There's a lot that can be done with that capability, and what I would say is stay tuned for where we're going to go with that, because that's a big part of where we're headed,\" Mauro said.With the debut of Messenger Platform 2.0 last month at Facebook developer conference F8, the Messenger camera is now able to scan QR codes. Recent changes to Facebook Messenger mean QR codes can be linked not just to a bot or profile, as was the case before, but to a broader range of destinations including a specific conversational experiences within a bot, like someone who wants to look for a gift as opposed to someone who can jump directly to sales.Beauty Gifter begins by asking the price range of the gift giver and age range of the recipient. Then the gift giver sends a card to the recipient that says, \"I want to buy you a gift.\"The bot then asks the gift receiver a series of questions about their skin tone and type, what color combinations they prefer, and whether dry or oily skin are concerns. Once questions are finished, the bot then sends a series of gift options to the gift giver.According to Mauro, asking the gift receiver what they want doesn't spoil the surprise because L'Oreal owns dozens of brands, from The Body Shop to Giorgio Armani.\"There's a whole bunch of crappy gift bots out there right now, and they mostly ask the gift giver to answer those questions. Well, the gift giver doesn't normally know the answer to those questions, but the gift receiver does,\" he said. \"A lot of people say, 'Hey, it will spoil the surprise'; we've actually found most people don't care about that. It doesn't really spoil the surprise since like a dozen L'oreal brands are a part of this.\"Both L'Oreal and Automat were mentioned onstage at F8 last week during the keynote speech from Messenger VP David Marcus as examples of innovative bots being made on the Messenger Platform.Marcus referred to Automat as one of a handful of companies that play crucial roles in the early Messenger bot ecosystem.Also mentioned at various times during the annual Facebook developer conference were Messenger Platform 2.0 were Epytom Stylist, a fashion recommendation bot, and a Sephora makeover appointment scheduler bot, two bots that also help with beauty and fashion tips.In another sign of the rush to combine fashion, bots, and ecommerce, last week Amazon launched its Echo Look, which combines Alexa and computer vision to help people pick outfits.Marketing and sales are due to play a large role in the future of the Messenger platform. Last month in an interview with Recode prior to F8, Marcus said Messenger's business model is centered on advertising, while earlier this year Messenger began testing advertisements on Messenger.Mauro thinks conversational marketing could give people an experience more like what you'd find in a store and reshape the business-customer relationship as brands begin to have more direct conversations with customers.L'Oreal also recently committed to \"establishing a new center of excellence for AI in Montreal.\" Montreal is a city increasingly associated with the growing AI industry. In recent months companies like Microsoft and Google have also made investments in AI centers in Montreal.Last fall Google opened an AI lab in Montreal and announced plans to grow a team there to beef up its representation in the city's deep learning community, while Microsoft doubled the size of its AI presence in Montreal earlier this year.Beauty Gifter will initially be available for sales in Canada only, though L'Oreal may deploy the bot in additional markets like the United Kingdom in 2018, Mauro said.Up until now, Automat has mostly run in stealth mode, but Mauro told VentureBeat his startup is beginning to gel around what it believes is the biggest opportunity in the age of bots on chat apps like Messenger: conversational marketing that delivers direct sales or a salesperson-like experience over digital channels.In some of its initial projects, Automat also created a Kalani Hilliker bot for fashion advice on Kik and a bot to educate people about the dangers of digging in your yard without identifying things like gas or water lines for California 811.\"I know we've been very quiet, very stealthy at Automat,\" Mauro said. \"It's very clear to me the biggest aspect of messaging and chatbots is going to be conversational marketing, more so than things like customer service and other aspects of it.\"\"Ecommerce in the last 25 years has built web and mobile storefronts that are just devoid of people, and I think conversational marketing is going to start populating those digital storefronts,\" he said.",

    "title": "7 lessons from developing a voicebot using Amazon Lex",
    "content": "I spent the past five months developing an AI-powered VoiceOps interface for the enterprise. Since Amazon Lex wasn't available at the time, my team open-sourced the project. We successfully launched it into production in February; it is now live with several customers, helping them prioritize problem resolution for enterprise apps. More recently, we started beta testing with Lex. Now that Lex is widely available to developers, I wanted to share with others some advice and best practices, based on our experiences.One of the foundations of building a voicebot is to be able to infer the user's intention from a spoken phrase. One of the things we quickly learned was to avoid combining too many related phrases into a single intent. For example, we originally mapped questions like \"Are there any problems at the moment?\" or \"Have any problems affected travel this week?\" to the same problem intent, which just overloaded the bot's logic. A better approach is to keep the scope of each intent as limited as possible.You're going to be tempted to add as many phrases as possible so that the user can speak naturally without having to worry about a specific required syntax. However, too many similar but different phrases can confuse the classifier and cause unexpected results. We found that it's much better to have a smaller subset of specific phrases that are sufficiently distinct. Lex may be more restrictive than true natural language, but it makes the results more consistent.It might seem that matching a phrase with a specific intent would be straightforward but, without context, it becomes confusing. For example, if a user says \"yes\" to a question, you need to store enough contexts in the voicebot to know exactly which question the user is answering.Accents and different pronunciations can be tricky for voicebots. In my experience, Lex works best with a Midwest American accent! But if you know your application is going to be used by people with a range of accents, it all comes down to training the system. You have to accurately train the voicebot to learn each very specific phrase and pronunciation so that the system knows how to match it with the desired intent. The same goes for specific words. For example, our company's name, Dynatrace, is not in Lex's dictionary. It hears \"diner\" or the name \"Dinah,\" so we had to train it to recognize not just the word, but also the specific actions and intents associated with its use when spoken.The key to being successful with voicebot development is to think broadly and laterally about all its potential use cases. Don't limit yourself.There's plenty of documentation that comes with Lex, but it can be technical and overwhelming -- so much so that you might not want to experiment. But the good news is that, despite the complexity of building voicebots, Lex makes it simple to create test apps and quickly discover what works and what doesn't so you can learn as you go.Most parsing services such as Amazon Lex will assume a future intent. For instance, if a user says \"What happened on Thursday?\" she is obviously asking about something that happened in the past. However, Lex doesn't inherently understand that. This is more of a challenge with the current state of natural language processing (NLP) and not a Lex-specific problem. As companies like Amazon invest in NLP, I'm hopeful we'll be able to distinguish timeframes with more clarity. But in the meantime, making tense super-specific is something developers will need to factor in.Michael Beemer is a DevOps engineer at Dynatrace and led the VoiceOps development team for Davis, Dynatrace's AI-powered digital performance virtual assistant.Above: The Machine Intelligence Landscape This article is part of our Artificial Intelligence series.

    "title": "Gaming beat the Supreme Court -- now it's time to defend AR and VR",
    "content": "The gaming industry has successfully fought off critics and their moral panics for decades, and now it's time to look ahead to the next battle.Two of the people who helped games find First Amendment protection revisited that battle today while also discussing how those lessons could stave off similar legal challenges to the emerging augmented and virtual reality industries. Ted Price, chief executive of Spider-Man and Ratchet & Clank studio Insomniac Games, and Mike Gallagher, chief executive of game-business lobbying group the Entertainment Software Association, took the GamesBeat Summit stage at Berkeley, California today to discuss what it means to take on a leadership role on an industry level.As an example, Price recounted working with the Entertainment Software Association to shape the organization's friend-of-the-court brief in the 2011 U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association. That heart of that legal fight was over a Californian law that sought to ban the sales of certain games to minors.\"We were shocked about what was happening with our constitutional rights,\" said Price.That led the Insomniac boss to agree to help the ESA prepare a legal defense of the industry. Price explained that he actually relished that opportunity.\"For me, what was really gratifying about that process is that it forced me to look at what we do,\" he said. \"I reevaluated how important our craft is to the world. We are in one of the most vibrant, living, evolving forms of media ever invented. And what was happening is that people who didn't play games -- in particular, legislators who didn't play games -- were looking at our stuff and saying, 'this is harmful. I don't know anything about it, but it's harmful.' And we had to take a stand against that and say, 'you're wrong.'\"In the end, the Supreme Court voted 7-2 to overturn California's law, which enshrined a First Amendment protection for video games. So now the ESA is preparing for new fights. And Gallagher expects the next legal battleground will happen when it comes to VR and AR.\"When we see these new technologies begin to be adopted in greater numbers, we worry that the critics will come forward and say that this is harming society,\" said Gallagher. \"Just like comic books, cable TV, or video games went through that, we could see those types of challenges [come to VR, AR, and mixed reality]. And we're ready for those.\"The moral panic surrounding VR has already begun to pick up some steam. If politicians aren't calling for a ban or censorship quite yet, some people in the media have started to ask for those kinds of regulations. In November, Aeon writer Angela Buckingham wrote, \"murder is illegal -- it should be illegal in virtual reality, too.\"So now, even if traditional games are protected, the ESA will likely have plenty of reasons to keep a few lawyers on staff for the foreseeable future.",

The Force Pro Package I provides a LE50 32GB body camera, Veripic       Evidence Storage Locker software, unlimited tech support and a 3-year       warranty to law enforcement departments for $18 per month (3-year       contract). This package can be used with in house or cloud storage.          The cost to implement Body Camera programs can create a strain on       municipal budgets due to high camera cost and lengthy contracts. The       Force Pro 1 package alleviates the overall cost to less than most       competitors charge for a camera.          \"We have already received over 100 orders for this Force Pro 1 system,\"       Stated Paul Feldman.          The LE50 key design features are:          Industry leading record time (10 hours @1080,12 hours @720)50       hours of standby time32GB of internal tamperproof storageWhite       LED illuminationAudio announcementsGPS recording30       second pre and post recordIntegration with VeriPic(c) Evidence       Management Software.          Mr. Feldman further commented, \"the LE50 was developed using current       guidelines that Law Enforcement nationwide have written into their       requirements for purchase of Bodycams for their officers. Our camera and       software via VeriPic(r) meets and exceeds these requirements. We are also       the first company to build into a Body Camera an audio announcement       feature. When the camera first starts to record an announcement clearly       states \"ATTENTION AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDING HAS STARTED\", when the       camera's recording mode is stopped it clearly states, \"ATTENTION AUDIO       AND VIDEO RECORDING HAS STOPPED.\" Our studies show when someone is made       aware of a recording taking place their attitude and demeanor tend to       turn more positive and less aggressive towards police officers.          The LE50 uses white diode lighting in our design because of a safety       issue. Cameras that utilize IR lighting can be harmful due the       brightness of the IR light and the fact that the human eye does not       react to this source of light, there is a high probability of whomever       looks at these lights can possible damage or injure their sight.\"          VeriPic(r) is a leading supplier of enterprise photo and evidence       management software to Law Enforcement Agencies.

    "content": "Skillz is taking mobile esports to a new milestone, announcing today that its revenue run-rate has doubled in the past eight months to more than $100 million.The San Francisco startup provides a platform to turn any mobile game on iOS and Android into a game you can play with friends or strangers for cash, prizes, or points. And it enables esports tournaments for games that integrate the Skillz platform.It took skills more than 36 months to generate its first $50 million annual run rate, and it took just eight to bring in the additional $50 million. That shows how fast the platform is growing. In the first quarter, the company had 3 million new users and higher player engagement, said Andrew Paradise, CEO of Skillz, in an interview with GamesBeat. (Paradise is speaking on an esports panel today at GamesBeat Summit 2017).\"The technology and concept of esports on mobile devices is shifting in the market,\" said Paradise. \"Mobile gaming keeps growing at crazy rates. It is now half of the total gaming market, but it was less than a fifth in 2012 when we started.\"Skillz reported revenue of $54 million in 2016, up 170 percent from $20 million in 2015. The esports economy will grow 41.3 percent to $696 million in 2017, according to market researcher Newzoo. The total market is expected to nearly triple to $1.5 billion by 2020.\"Every six months or so, the projections are growing,\" Paradise said. \"The speed with which esports is growing in mind-blowing.\"In 2014, Skillz awarded 8 percent of all esports prizes, with that figure increasing to over 21 percent in 2015. After initially projecting that the company would account for over 30 percent in 2016, Skillz exceeded expectations, finishing the year at over 46 percent of all esports prizes.Above: Let's go bowling with Skillz!Skillz wants to bring esports to the mass market by expanding the category beyond an audience that is currently 85 percent male, according to SuperData Research. Since June 2016, the Skillz user base has grown by more than 32 percent to 11.9 million. While acquiring almost 3 million additional players, Skillz also increased its number of female players from 49 percent of the company's user base in June 2016 to 53 percent today. This marks the first time that the majority of the Skillz user base has been female.The company has also seen its average player spend an increasing number of minutes competing in mobile esports tournaments on the Skillz platform. In June 2016, Skillz said its average player competed for over 50 minutes per day. By October 2016, that average increased to 58 minutes a day. As of March, engagement increased again to over 61 minutes a day, a gain of over 5 percent, which pushes Skillz past the coveted one-hour daily engagement mark. By comparison, people spend 40 minutes a day on YouTube, 35 minutes a day on Facebook and 25 minutes a day on Snapchat.\"You see more casual games adding esports,\" said Paradise. \"People compete in higher levels, and they are spectated. It's like the birth of television or the NFL launching in 1919. You see some of the same kind of changes in content.\"One of the customers is Tether Studios, a two-person studio that had trouble getting organic growth for its Solitaire Cube game. The company had incorporated ads, but it had disappointing results of average revenue per daily active user (ARPDAU) at 2 cents. Then Tether integrated the Skillz platform into the game so that players could compete head-to-head in competitions for prizes. Each player has five minutes to solve a solitaire puzzles, and the winner gets bragging rights on leaderboards.Above: SkillzThe result was a big boost in retention. The percentage of players who came back after the first day was 64 percent. It was 50 percent at day seven, and 33 percent after 30 days. The number of daily active users increased, and, with hundreds of cash tournaments running daily, the ARPDAU rose to 45 cents, or 20 times better.\"With the Skillz platform, we were easily able to add a competitive spin to Solitaire Cube that, in turn, increased our monetization and provided an ad-free experience for our users,\" said Tim and Ether O'Neil of Tether Studios.Another customer is Game Masons, which made the game Mini Golf Stars. Game Masons had a hard time getting players to come back. It partnered with Skillz to add tournaments and leaderboards. Not only was Game Masons able to increase ARPDAU, retention, and new installations, it said day seven retention is 27 percent, and ARPDAU is 40 cents, up 1,400 percent from before Skillz.Before it added Skillz, the Mini Golf Stars! Retro Golf Game ranked No. 136 among all U.S. sports apps. After the Skillz integration, the game reached rank No. 12 at its highest.Skillz provides the esports platform for more than 3,000 game studios. The company was founded in 2012, and it has 68 employees. Its investors include the owners of the New England Patriots, Milwaukee Bucks and New York Mets.\"The Skillz platform has increased the depth of Mini Golf Stars, and the leaderboards and player matching have been instrumental for my players,\" said Matt Fossati, CEO of Game Masons.",

THQ Nordic is announcing today that it is developing Darksiders III with Gunfire Games with an eye on an unspecified 2018 release date.Lars Wingefors, the CEO of Vienna, Austria-based THQ Nordic, said his company (formerly Nordic Games) acquired the rights to Darksiders when it bought the old THQ properties in bankruptcy proceedings in 2013. Last year, Nordic Games rebranded itself as THQ Nordic, and fans started asking if the company would bring back the Darksiders franchise of action games, which first appeared in 2010 (the second hit in 2012).The time may be ripe. THQ Nordic is tapping Gunfire Games in Austin, Texas, because it was founded by key members of Vigil Games, which made the original titles for THQ. Dave Adams, president of Gunfire Games and cofounder of Vigil, is leading the development effort.Above: Reinhard Pollice, head of business and product development at THQ Nordic.\"We brought them back to the franchise,\" said THQ Nordic's Reinhard Pollice, head of business and product development, in an interview with GamesBeat. \"We're very excited to share this news with everybody because it has become a dominant topic for us.\"Darksiders will star a female character known as Fury, who the original Darksiders briefly referenced in its tale about War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\"We went to the drawing board and tried to understand what the character Fury stands for,\" Pollice said.Above: Lars Wingefors, CEO of THQ Nordic.\"We are excited about what kind of reaction people will have for it,\" said Lars Wingefors, CEO of THQ Nordic, in an interview. \"We've been thinking about doing a new Darksiders game ever since we acquired it. There are big expectations for it. This is our biggest franchise.\"The story for the game happens before the first Darksiders takes place. It is during the time of the apocalypse, when the Seven Deadly Sins roost on Earth. Fury must restore the balance on the mortal plane and hunt down the Seven Deadly Sins, Pollice said.\"Darksiders II was both action-adventure and role-playing game,\" Wingefors said. \"We wanted to deliver a more-focused Darksiders III.\"The main pillars are on exploration, combat, and story. Fury wields a whip, which will make combat much different from the previous games. I guess that makes it a whip-and-slash game, rather than a hack-and-slash romp.In the story, the Charred Council calls upon Fury to battle from the heights of heaven down through the depths of hell in a quest to restore humanity and prove that she is the most powerful of the Horsemen. As a mage, Fury relies on her whip and magic to restore the balance between good and evil.Above: Darksiders III is coming.THQ Nordic said the expansive, Darksiders III game world will be an open-ended Earth that is dilapidated by war and decay, and overrun by nature. Fury will move back and forth between environments to uncover secrets while advancing the Darksiders III story.Wingefors said the company received a huge amount of fan suggestions for Darksiders III, and it reviewed all of them.THQ Nordic has more than 100 employees and 375 contractors. Gunfire Games has 60 people. They are building the game for the PC and the consoles.",

    "content": "The PC's hottest game is PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. It has everything: nude skydivers, janky physics, and Army of Two face masks. It also has an enormous audience.The Bluehole game studio announced today that Battlegrounds has surpassed 2 million copies sold through Valve's Steam PC gaming service since its March 23 debut. This comes after the multiplayer survival sim hit 1 million copies sold less than a month ago on April 10. Battlegrounds, which is similar to the Japanese Battle Royale films and books, has 100 people jumping out of a plane and onto an island. You start with nothing but your wits, and you spend match looking for weapons, armor, and other items to help ensure you are the last person standing.Battlegrounds has is still in an unfinished state as part of Steam's Early Access portal, but it has caught on with such a huge number of players due to its premise and its popularity as a streaming game on YouTube and Twitch. Bluehole is continuing to work on its hit game, and it has already rolled out a number of updates that has kept players engaged and coming back to see the changes and new weapons. The studio plans to continue with regular updates for the foreseeable future.\"One of the main reasons we were able to hit this sales milestone is that we have a dedicated community who has helped us refine PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,\" Bluehole chief executive Gang-Seok Kim said in a statement.To celebrate this latest milestone, Bluehole revealed that it is planning to match donations as part of its upcoming charity event. On Thursday, the studio will hold the PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds 2017 Charity Invitational.

    "content": "Blackstorm Labs is launching an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot for its EverWing game on Facebook Messenger's Instant Games platform.The chatbot is part of the rich new features that Facebook is enabling today for Instant Games makers, which generated more than 1.5 billion plays in their first 90 days. Facebook has more than 50 games out on the platform, and with it, you can jump into games on Messenger without having to download an app.EverWing players can now communicate with a \"Gamebot\" directly on Messenger. Facebook Messenger also announced the launch of other rich platform features, notably in-chat messaging between the game and groups of players. These have been integrated into a new crop of EverWing game features designed to push growth and engagement on this new platform. Blackstorm cofounder Ernestine Fu will talk about platforms at our GamesBeat Summit 2017 event today in Berkeley, California.The team at Blackstorm developed the EverWing Gamebot in collaboration with Facebook, which helped to build the new applications programming interface (APIs) necessary to connect Messenger's AI chatbot functionality to the inner workings of the Instant Games platform.Facebook announced these platform APIs at F8 this year, and Blackstorm showed off EverWing as the example of a beta gamebot integration.Andrea Vaccari, Messenger Games lead and product manager, said in a statement, \"When it comes to Gamebots, Blackstorm was as excited as we were from the very first day. Our teams worked closely together to find new and unique ways for players to interact with Instant Games, and we're so excited to see what they've built on their first try. For example, Everwing's Gamebot makes it easy to track and manage side quests, and elegantly complements the main in-game experience. We think players will love this new type of interaction, and we expect other games to start integrating these best practices soon.\"Above: Blackstorm Labs launches chatbot for EverWing, a Facebook Instant Game.More than just notifications, players can message the EverWing Gamebot in the same way that they might message a friend, and even more, they can also control certain game mechanics and actions directly through the chat interface.Michael Carter, co-founder and CEO Blackstorm, said in a statement, \"The new AI chat bot in EverWing is going to completely revolutionize the way that players are able to interact with the game. Messaging and gameplay -- which are typically separated across two completely different worlds -- have been fused together to create a whole new user experience that our players love. I'm thrilled to have been able to work closely with Facebook to develop these new features. The whole Messenger team has been a great partner and together we've pushed each other to expand what is possible for EverWing, and Instant Games.\"Currently, the EverWing Gamebot has a few roles: narrating adventures, boss raids energy, and social power-up awards. When narrating adventures, the EverWing Gamebot can send rich, chat-based updates to players that describes the details of their quests, and allows those quests to be claimed and managed simply by chatting with the Gamebot.With boss raids energy, the EverWing Gamebot updates players as their energies refill and also allows them to see all their raid bosses at once. The EverWing Gamebot also can help players to share social power-up awards, which enable users to share a special ability with their entire Boss Raid group, allowing players to coordinate their timing, skills and special abilities to more effectively take on bosses.Besides the Gamebot, Blackstorm is also launching another feature: Group Shopping Sprees. In order to help players to try to obtain expensive items, like the game's valuable Legendary Dragons, EverWing helps players post a short-lived but significant bonus for all other players in the group, enabling them to purchase more items with the gold they've collected (something studios will enjoy for monetization).Above: Blackstorm Labs' EverWing chatbot.",

Game bots help re-engage players by calling out new game options and encouraging competition with updates on the leaderboards.When developers start to take advantage of these new capabilities, the games will become more dynamic and engaging, said Andrea Vaccari, the product manager for Messenger at Facebook.One of the first games to take advantage of the update is Zynga's Words With Friends. Words With Friends, one of the most popular games of all time, is now available as a feature-rich, turn-based game directly in Messenger.People will see changes as game developers start to incorporate the new capabilities. One of Instant Games on Messenger's biggest hits, Blackstorm's EverWing, is among the first to use game bots.Depending on what device you use and where you are located, there are now up to 50 games titles available on Messenger, with more being introduced almost every week. The No. 1 Pool game -- Miniclip's 8 Ball Pool -- will debut on Instant Games very soon.The new Instant Games on Messenger will roll out over the next few weeks worldwide for both iOS and Android, starting today.The creators of Instant Games hope that it will bring virality back to the social-mobile games business and offer a chance for breakout hits on messenger platforms. Those hits can spread on social, bypassing the app stores.Bypassing apps can be disruptive because they come with a lot of friction. Apps have to be advertised heavily because it's hard to find them amid millions of other apps in the stores. Then they have to be downloaded and installed. Then the user has to open the app and play. Each one of those points is a source of friction where some of the potential users will drop off.HTML5 games had problems for a long time, with the first games based on the HTML5 standard launching way back in 2008. Initial games were slow and didn't perform well. But as smartphone hardware improved over time, the performance problems went away.",

Windows 10 S is limited to apps that exist in the Windows Store, thus preventing third-party apps from slowing down machines by hooking into the boot and sign-in process.Broadly, Windows 10 S represents part of the company's strategic response to Google's Chrome OS, except Microsoft is placing a firm focus on full offline access by default.Partner manufacturers will begin selling Windows 10 S PCs this summer, starting at $189.Read more on Windows 10 S here. Though Microsoft's event was largely focused on software, the company did unveil a brand new piece of hardware that showcases its new Windows 10 S operating system. The Surface Laptop sports a 13.5-inch touchscreen display and promises 14.5 hours of battery.The device is open for preorders today starting at $999, with shipping kicking off on June 15.Read more on the Microsoft Surface Laptop here, or check out our hands-on with the device.Relating to the Windows 10 S news, Microsoft also announced that it's bringing Microsoft Office to the Windows Store, which makes sense given that Windows 10 S will only be able to run apps that can be downloaded from the Windows Store.Read more on Microsoft Office in the Windows Store here.Microsoft launched its Slack-like group chat software Teams globally in March as part of Office 365. So far it has largely been aimed at businesses, but it was also available in the Office 365 Education version for students, faculty, and staff to collaborate.At its event in New York today, Microsoft said that it wants Teams to \"become the collaborative hub for classroom project-oriented learning,\" and it debuted a handful of new collaboration tools designed specifically for the classroom.Read more on Microsoft Teams in education here.Microsoft also announced Code Builder, a tool that lets Minecraft players create structures inside the game using JavaScript.

The final version launches Thursday on the Windows PC and Mac. Minecraft, its competitor, has sold 122 million copies and has 55 million monthly active players.More than two years ago, Creativerse quietly debuted on Steam in the Early Access program, a business model that enables a game studio to sell their produce in an unfinished state while collecting feedback from players and adding new content and mechanics. Since then, Creativerse has grown by hundreds of thousands of players thanks to word of mouth.Now, Playful is officially launching Creativerse as a complete experience, opening the doors to an even bigger audience, and all while development continues.Creativerse is a massively multiplayer sandbox adventure. It has a gigantic open world of breathtaking vistas, treacherous catacombs, strange, quirky creatures, and other surprises.\"The response to Creativerse has been staggering, given our under-the-radar strategy for marketing during Early Access,\" said Paul Bettner, founder and CEO of Playful, in a statement. \"It shows people are hungry for this type of game, one that makes it delightful and easy for anyone to build anything they can imagine. And it's really gratifying to see how much our players enjoy being involved in the development process, as their feedback was invaluable in making the game what it is today.\"Like in rival Minecraft, players can use materials, tools, and customization options for shaping their world, including intuitive crafting, a catalog of blocks and decorative pieces, and step-by-step guided blueprints to help players get started.Additional features include a simplified multiplayer experience that makes it easy to connect with friends in a private world, or find new friends in a public world. Early Access players have been particularly excited about the player-published adventure feature that allows them to share their creations with millions of other Creativerse players.While some games launching from Early Access stop receiving updates, this will not be the case for Creativerse. The studio has ambitious plans, such as tools to making building quicker and easier, more customization options, tinkering with game mechanics, and better sharing of player-created content. The studio plans to sometime add an in-game marketplace where players can make real money from their work.\"If there's one thing our players have taught us, it's that their imagination and creative talent is as vast as the universe,\" said Daniel Havens, Creativerse's game director, in a statement. \"The best thing we can do for them is continue providing more tools to unleash that creativity.\"",

Panos Panay, head of engineering for all of Microsoft's devices, took the stage to show off Microsoft's latest mobile device, available for preorder today and shipping on June 15 starting at $999.Microsoft's new laptop features a 13.5-inch PixelSense display with 3.4 million pixels (1080p, 3:2 aspect ratio). Panay declared that the Surface Laptop has the \"thinnest LCD touch module on a laptop.\" Best of all, he promised a battery life of 14.5 hours.Basic specifications include an Intel Core i5 CPU (upgradeable to core i7), 4GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD for storage. The laptop's thickness ranges from 9.9mm to 14.47mm. The device has very few ports: a USB port, a mini DisplayPort, the Surface power connector, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.The keyboard uses alcantara, the same fabric used in Surface Pro 4's premium keyboard option. For better or for worse, Microsoft integrated the speakers right under the keyboard.The Surface Laptop weighs 2.76 pounds, which is a bit more than a Surface Pro 4 (2.37 pounds) but less than a Surface Book (3.34 pounds). The device will be available in four colors: burgundy, cobalt blue, platinum, and graphite gold.Panay also said the Surface Laptop is thinner and lighter than any MacBook or MacBook Pro, 50 percent faster than the MacBook Air, and has better battery life than any Mac laptop.The purpose of the device is similar to others in the Surface family: to show computer manufacturers what's possible, and potentially define a new category. Microsoft once again is not looking to dominate PC sales, but rather invigorate them.Indeed, Microsoft today also announced that its partners will be offering Windows 10 education PCs starting at $189 this summer.

    "title": "Favorite to be France's next president is a big Silicon Valley fan",
    "content": "French voters will return to the ballot box this Sunday to choose a new president in a second round of voting that will pit far-right Marine Le Pen against centrist Emmanuel Macron.Polls have shown Macron with a pretty steady 60 percent lead over Le Pen since the first round of voting made them the two finalists. While the campaign has been heated, and will likely remain so this week, Macron seems like a good bet to win.This means that Silicon Valley is likely to have a big fan in the next president of France.Macron is a former investment banker who served for about three years as Economics Minister under the current government. Before taking that gig, he took a monthlong holiday in California, much of it in Silicon Valley, where he met with local business and government leaders to discuss innovation.From the begining of his term as Economic Minister in 2014, he made support for entrepreneurship a clear centerpiece of his agenda. The first time I saw him was at Le Web in 2014.He had just replaced the previous Economics Minister, a man who had caused a stir when he blocked the acquisition of France's Dailymotion by Yahoo. The feeling previously had been that protectionism was the best way to create jobs in France. But speaking at Le Web, Macron made it clear that he would have decided differently, and that allowing exits was critical to entrepreneurs and investors.He also spent a fair bit of time discussing the need to embrace disruption, to embrace change and the future, rather than setting up barriers to resist it.\"To be clear about the French momentum, we are accelerating,\" he said on stage at the Le Web conference in December 2014. \"They key question for us is how to accelerate, and how to help create new businesses. ... My job is to be sure that in the coming years we create thousands of new businesses to replace the old ones. ... My job is to protect people and allow them to be innovative and take risks.\"Macron became a big supporter of La French Tech, the program previously set in place to encourage and support startups and entrepreneurs in France. In 2015 and 2016, he accompanied delegations of French startups to the Consumer Electronics Show to promote their prospects, and to demonstrate the change in attitude he argued was happening across France.Following the 2016 CES, he travelled to San Francisco to meet French entrepreneurs there, and then stopped for meetings at Apple and Google.\"There is a cultural revolution in progress, that of the entrepreneurial force in France that the country needs,\" he told French entrepreneurs in San Francisco. He said he wanted to change the culture in France, where there is a great fear of failing, but also a suspicion of people who want to be too successful: \"That leaves little room to maneuver.\"Indeed, Macron has built his campaign like a startup. He hired a political technology firm last year to help him research and interview thousands of French citizens to learn about their hopes and fears. Using his website, mobile apps, big data, and data visualization tools, he created En Marche!, an independent political movement that offered a new centrist philosophy.Macron embraced trade, disruption, the European Union, immigration, and the need to support entrepreneurs with new programs. He has emerged as the clear favorite of France's startup set. That platform also saw him finish first among 11 candidates in the first round of voting last month.With Macron in charge, Silicon Valley can expect a sympathetic ear, but not necessarily one that will accede to its every wish. In the past, for instance, Macron has supported Uber's right to operate in France. But he has also been insistent that companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Google pay their fair share of taxes.That said, under Macron Silicon Valley can likely expect a warmer welcome than it has ever experienced in France. The question for France's economy is whether that will encourage more U.S. tech firms and investors to plant a flag in Paris and give the country's start ecosystem another shot of adrenaline.",

A week later, the company made Teams available in Office 365 Education so faculty, staff, and students could also use the chat-based collaboration tool.Joe Belfiore, corporate vice president in Microsoft's operating systems group, told VentureBeat that Microsoft wants Teams to \"become the collaborative hub for classroom project-oriented learning.\" Teams naturally offers a very chat-based workflow, which Microsoft hopes will help foster a variety of types of discussions in and out of the classroom.But the pitch to schools takes this one step further: Teams is billed as a \"modern, state-of-the art collaboration system that's just like the collaboration systems used in companies.\"Put another way, Microsoft hopes that teachers will want to use and teach with Teams like they already do with Office. The idea is that using Microsoft tools could not only make their lives easier, it also prepares their students for the workplace where these tools are being used.More specifically, teachers can use Teams to automatically load settings and projects whenever a new class starts. This is not just on their device but also on devices their students pick up and sign into at the start of class. When a new class or workgroup is created, it comes with its own OneNote notebook, so students can always look back at what was shown five minutes ago or five days ago. Teachers can also easily offer assessments, quizzes, and so on right in Teams.Microsoft Teams for Education is also getting an assignment service. The teacher version of Teams allows users to create assignments, put a due date, and assign work to a class or subset of students. The student version, meanwhile, includes everything needed to let users submit assignments.Microsoft is moving incredibly quickly with Teams. Today's education-specific updates are just a small piece of a bigger push to get millions using the chat-based system, though the company still has no plans to offer a free version.",

    "title": "500 Startups promotes Chris Neumann to venture partner, launches data track",
    "content": "500 Startups is making a significant commitment to startups working in the big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence spaces. Today, the firm promoted its entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) and former DataHero cofounder Chris Neumann to venture partner, where he'll be tasked with finding worthwhile investments. In addition, 500 Startups has launched a data track to provide specialized advice and resources to big data startups that are part of the firm's accelerator program.Neumann first joined 500 Startups in February as an EIR. He told VentureBeat then that his goal was to help companies with \"a heavy focus or influence of data on technology\" bring their product to market and sell it to customers, particularly those who may not have day jobs as data scientists.Traditional venture capital doesn't work for enterprise data companies, Neumann asserted. \"You bootstrap your company, then raise money, and 18 months later you have a minimum viable product (MVP), and months later you have traction,\" he said. \"But with deep tech companies, building a product takes longer than 18 months. It can be more capital-intensive and can take years.\" In his mind, when it comes to big data, machine learning, or AI startups, investors have to move beyond a one-strategy-fits-all mentality.\"Last year, while exploring what I wanted to do, I talked to a lot of people that were data founders,\" he said in an interview. \"When I had the opportunity to talk to 500 Startups, it was about mentoring, about giving an opportunity to see the value of an accelerator. But what if we did something...not like a general purpose accelerator, but the pieces that people building interesting data companies need.\"With Neumann's elevation to venture partner, he joins a roster of existing partners at 500 Startups -- like Adam Benayoun, Philipp Moehring, James Riney, Matt Lerner, Tristan Pollock, Binh Tran, Cjin Cheng, Monique Woodard, and others.Recognizing that data tech companies may require some extra hand-holding when it comes to growing their business, tapping into their market, and finding customers, 500 Startups is launching a data track, which is similar to the fintech, health, and beauty and fashion tracks previously launched. The firm has enlisted the help of numerous industry experts, such as Keen IO founder Kyle Wild, Sophos vice president of security analytics Raffael Marty, GE Aviation vice president of sales Lee Paries, Amazon AI principal product manager Robert Munro, and Parrable founder Carla Holtze. Neumann is spearheading this program.Startups wishing to participate in the data track must be part of 500 Startups' most recent accelerator batch, which has begun accepting applications. There are no extra costs associated with the program -- think of it as added college elective courses. But Neumann is going to be pretty selective about who it admits and will limit the program to between eight and 10 companies. The lucky ones will be those with deep technology at their core -- it's about the application of data, after all.\"I definitely have a thesis on what's interesting: generally, infrastructure (platforms that will benefit a lot of people), last-mile technology (interesting systems exposing data in unique ways), and vertical-specific business apps that are not just business apps with data, but data is really at the core of what they're doing,\" Neumann stated.Applications for the 500 Startups' 22nd batch and data track are now being accepted.",

    "title": "Microsoft is bringing Office to the Windows Store",
    "content": "At its Microsoft EDU event in New York City today, the company announced it is bringing Microsoft Office to the Windows Store. We're talking about the full Win32 version of Office -- this is not a mobile version, Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app, or an otherwise dumbed-down release.Terry Myerson, executive vice president for Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, confirmed onstage that Word, Excel, PowerPoint, \"and more\" were coming. He did not give a date for the launch (Update: Microsoft confirmed after the event that the target is June).The timing of this announcement is no coincidence. At the event, Microsoft unveiled Windows 10 S and the company's broader strategic answer to Google's Chrome OS. Being able to get the full version of Microsoft Office from the Windows Store and use it without an internet connection is a notable differentiator.We had the opportunity to discuss today's news with Joe Belfiore, corporate vice president in Microsoft's operating systems group. The only time Belfiore mentioned Chromebooks during our conversation was in respect to the fact they can't use Office offline.You can expect Microsoft to play up this fact in the months to come: Windows 10 S, and the Microsoft Office version that you can run on it, works offline. You can't get that on Chrome OS.Office is not the first set of Win32 apps in the Windows Store. This is part of a broader effort called Project Centennial, which lets desktop developers package and publish their existing .NET and Win32-based Windows applications to the Windows Store. The app type was first unveiled at Microsoft's Build developer conference in April 2015, but the first apps only started arriving in September 2016.If Windows S is to succeed, Microsoft will need to keep pushing Win32 developers to use the Windows Store. Bringing its arguably most successful software to its app store is an important step in that effort.",

    "title": "Microsoft unveils Windows 10 S, an education edition limited to Windows Store apps",
    "content": "At its education event in New York City today, Microsoft announced a new edition of its latest operating system: Windows 10 S. Available on first-party and third-party hardware -- Microsoft will be releasing its own Windows 10 S device and will also let manufacturers sell their own -- Windows 10 S is a streamlined edition of Windows 10 aimed at the education market. Microsoft partners will begin offering PCs running Windows 10 S this summer, starting at $189, and Microsoft will also ship its own Surface Laptop running Windows 10 S, starting at $999, on June 15.The main way that Windows 10 S differs from the other editions is that it can only run apps from the Windows Store. That includes Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps and Win32 apps that Microsoft has accepted into its app store. Not coincidentally, Microsoft is bringing Office to the Windows Store.The goal is to avoid the problems of traditional Win32 apps that often run in the background and push their own updates. Microsoft wants to stop apps from hooking into the boot and sign-in process to handle all their own updates, which in turn slows down startup time. Windows Store can take care of this today, but Windows 10 S makes it the only way to install and update apps. As a result, Microsoft hopes Windows 10 S will be able to offer faster sign-in times (about 15 seconds) and better battery life.Terry Myerson, executive vice president for Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, demoed Windows 10 S on stage. He showed how users are blocked from installing apps from the web (pictured above); how much faster Windows 10 S sign-in is compared to Windows 10 Pro, which has many apps in the boot process; and how schools can manage hundreds of devices. For example, teachers can preload software using only a USB key.This is still a full version of Windows 10. It's just locked down to only work with apps that Microsoft has approved, similar to how Apple and Google lock down iOS and Android to their respective app stores.Windows 10 S also differs in two other ways. It is cloud-manageable (Windows 10 Home is not, but Pro is) through Microsoft's Intune, Intune for Education, and other modern management systems. It also sets up OneDrive cloud syncing by default, whereas other editions allow the user to skip this step and opt out of using OneDrive.Here's the picture Microsoft is trying to paint for schools. You have a 45-minute class. Your students need to be able to sign in on a device they didn't use yesterday. The login process gets all their content, reliably and quickly. You don't sit there waiting five minutes for your kids to log in. The devices need to last all day (no battery dying in 7th period). Lastly, the devices need to be easy to manage so you can install and update apps effortlessly.For the record, the \"S\" in Windows 10 S does not stand for \"student.\" It refers to Windows being more streamlined and secure and having superior performance. It's the same idea as the Xbox One S -- Windows 10 S is the core essence of Windows. Myerson called it the \"soul\" of today's Windows.The reason Microsoft isn't using the word \"student\" in the name is pretty simple: Although Windows 10 S is clearly aimed at this group, the company doesn't want to pigeon-hole it. Microsoft is hoping non-students buy Windows 10 S devices as well. If they find it inadequate, they can always upgrade.Windows 10 S will be easily upgradeable to Windows 10 Pro via the Windows Store. For educators, the upgrade is free. For end users and businesses, the cost is $49.Schools running earlier Windows Pro editions can move to Windows 10 S for free. This means running a later version of Windows, but they have to be okay with limiting their devices to only Windows Store apps.Windows 10 S is Microsoft's answer to Google's Chrome OS, and even Apple's iPad push in schools. Myerson didn't mention the latter, but he did knock Chromebooks a few times onstage. This will be a fierce battle as tech giants strive to have students taught on their own platforms -- get them young and you could win them over for life.",

    "title": "Docker replaces CEO Ben Golub with former Concur cofounder and CEO Steve Singh",
    "content": "Docker, the high-flying startup behind an open-source platform that helps developers build and ship distributed applications, has announced that CEO Ben Golub is stepping aside and will be replaced by Concur cofounder and CEO Steve Singh. Golub, who has served as CEO of Docker since 2013, will remain as a director on Docker's board, while Singh will continue to serve as chairman of the board.Singh has served as an executive at SAP since the company snapped up Concur, a finance and expenses software platform, in an $8 billion deal in 2014. But news emerged last month that he was leaving the company after more than 20 years. With almost $200 million in equity financing, Docker is regarded by many as a potential IPO candidate, so grabbing an executive of Singh's caliber as its new CEO is a major coup.\"Over the past four years, Docker has grown at an incredible rate. We are now seeing widespread traction in the developer community and the enterprise market,\" said Docker founder and CTO Solomon Hykes, in a press release. \"Without Ben, Docker wouldn't be in such an incredible position as a platform and as a company. Under his leadership, we built a world-class team and a huge, diverse community that is rewriting the rules of software development and distribution. Ben built the foundation for an exceptional company, and demand for Docker's product is off the charts. With Steve's unique expertise, we will build an organization capable of delivering on that demand and serving our customers across the globe.\"In short, Golub helped Docker get to where it is today as a leading player in the developer tools realm, while also helping it grow in the enterprise software market. Singh's experience taking Concur from startup to a publicly traded company to part of a bigger corporate giant, in the form of SAP, will surely help take Docker to the next level.\"As companies look to create a new generation of applications and services to bring their business into the global digital economy, many are turning to Docker for dramatic improvements in developer productivity and new operational and capital efficiencies,\" explained Sing. \"I look forward to working with the entire Docker team, as well as the broader Docker community to help usher in the new era of application computing.\"",

    "title": "How Watch Dogs 2 stayed ahead of current events",
    "content": "For Watch Dogs 2, the truth turned out to be stranger than fiction.At the GamesBeat Summit today in Berkeley, California. (watch it here), tech journalist Violet Blue and Watch Dogs brand content director Thomas Geffroyd spoke about the eerie similarities between the open-world hacking series and current events. Blue, who's reported extensively on the underground hacking culture, was a consultant on last year's Watch Dogs 2.According to Geffroyd, one of the reasons Ubisoft's Montreal studio started working on the first Watch Dogs game seven years ago was \"because of the phones we have in our pocket and how technology was basically taking everything around us in a new spiral of uncertainty.\" The studio wanted the brand to accurately represent some of the real-world anxiety behind hacking and constantly connected devices -- as well as show the possible futures that can lead to.As an example, Blue talked about how in Watch Dogs 2, the police use a special profiling software to target hero Marcus Holloway. During the press tour in October 2016, Blue said predictive policing was just starting to get media coverage.\"It was something that a lot of us, and a lot of us hackers, knew about,\" she said. \"It's essentially the buying-and-selling of data through third-party companies to police departments across the United States to profile, follow, and track protesters. And to also do what they call 'predictive policing' in different areas, where they would do algorithmic predictions on certain areas in certain neighborhoods to predict where crime would happen.\"Not surprisingly, it was a really racist algorithm. Which is how it ended up playing into the storyline in the game.\"After Watch Dogs 2 came out in December, more real-world examples emerged. Blue pointed out Geofeedia, a social media analytics company who sold data to police that specifically targeted Black Lives Matter protesters.\"Geofeedia was essentially using developer tools to scrape data off of things like Facebook and resell it to police departments. ... [Watch Dogs 2] had created and followed that to its natural conclusion of what could possibly go wrong,\" said Blue.Hacking was also a big talking point in the news during and after the fraught U.S. presidential election due to Russia's alleged interference.\"We've put so much energy into trying to be true to the technology and trying to leverage the point of view of hackers, which is very unique ... . It has allowed us to extrapolate on technology that was already there, but with which the dark side wasn't already seen or planned,\" said Geffroyd.Geffroyd credits Watch Dogs's prescient stories to the hacking community -- \"who's a step ahead in terms of technology and risks\" -- the developers spent a lot of time with while doing research for the game.\"[The similarities were] uncanny, actually,\" said Blue. \"What was amazing about [Watch Dogs 2] was that it did the thing that great games do in that it told a story to the player that was familiar and resonated with everyone, tapping into a lot of fears and concerns ... . But it also told a new story about these concepts that everyone is learning about and dealing with when it comes to data being bought and sold in the background, profiling algorithms, and things like that. And it told them something new about it.\"",
