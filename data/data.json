The competition saw 50 applicants from over 18 countries competing for the top positions and cash prizes. The Amman competition follows the first Fincluders challenge held in Berlin last year. The top position of the Fincluders challenge and a cash prize of $20,000 went to AgroCenta, a startup which provides an online trading hub for farmers and their customers using real-time payments leveraged by mobile-money technologies. In addition to the trading hub, the startup also provides an on-demand logistics service. \"The Fincluders Startup Challenge has been an eye opener for us, helping startups accelerate by giving them the opportunity to network and meet potential investors and partners,\" said Francis Obirikorang, co-founder and CEO of AgroCenta in a press release to Ventureburn. Second place with a cash prize of $10,000 went to Liwwa, a marketplace lender to SMEs in Jordan. Democrance, a Jordan-based micro-insurance provider for those living in low-income populations, took third place, with a cash prize of $5,000. BenBen, a startup providing access to blockchain \"land transactions\", while not making it into the top three, received an honourable mention at Fincluders. \"We are both elated and humbled by the interest in the Fincluders Startup Challenge here in Amman. The finalists proved their skills and determination during the pitching round of the competition, and we are confident these fledgeling businesses can contribute to spreading access to finance in the region, which is also the main goal of our fund,\" said Sanad board chair Daniela Beckmann. Finalists were provided with flights and accommodation for the duration of the competition. The first day featured mentoring sessions conducted by range of industry experts, while the second day required finalists to present their products and services to a jury of industry experts. ",

Seedstars World will hold events in Johannesburg on 26 May and in Cape Town on 8 June, with the top applicants to be invited to the finale hosted at the Standard Bank Auditorium in Johannesburg on 29 June. The SA leg of Seedstars World is being held in partnership with Standard Bank and other local partners such as Enel, Microsoft4Afrika, Orange, Merck, TRECC and Deloitte. Other local partners include Entrepreneur Traction, PayU, Seedspace, Simodisa and Startup Grind. To be eligible to apply for the competition startups need to be less than two years old, have raised under $500,000 in funding and have built a minimum viable product. Additionally, eligible startups would need to have existing traction and some regional and global scalability. \"Standard Bank is proud to be the country sponsor of Seedstars South Africa for the third year,\" said Jayshree Naidoo, head of the Standard Bank incubator in a press release to Ventureburn. \"These partnerships allow us to help change the narrative of the potential that exists on the continent and helps us recognise and create access to market opportunities for those businesses that make it to the regional finals and the finals,\" said Naidoo. In addition to the SA leg, the global competition will travel to 80 countries in search of their best startups to pitch for their chance at winning $500,000 in investments. Previous Seedstars World participants have raised over $61-million collectively, providing employment to more than 800 employees worldwide. \"South Africa does indeed have world class entrepreneurial talent. Our priority for 2017 is to cast the net event wider and give the opportunity to the whole country to participate and become part of a global journey,\" said regional manager for Africa at Seedstars World Claudia Makadristo. South Africa has been represented before at previous Seedstars World finals. Giraffe won the global prize in 2015 and in 2016 IDWork was the competition's wildcard winner. \"The entire Seedstars world experience has been absolutely amazing -- from the regional summit in Rwanda to the global summit in Switzerland. I have been very inspired by the entrepreneurs from all different corners of the world. \"Together with them, I got to meet investors, mentors and corporates,\" said IDWork co-founder Arjun Khoosal.

      "content": "Nigeria must overcome its infrastructure challenges and shortage of skills if it is to help the country's nascent tech scene to grow, say analysts and entrepreneurs. The country boasts such successful tech companies such as fintech company Interswitch, edtech firm Andela and e-commerce site Jumia, which last year raised $326-million in funding. In addition, investments from overseas programmes such as Y Combinator, Village Capital and 500 Startups continue afoot, despite the country having slipped into a recession last year. Nigeria's burgeoning startup scene and its large market and entrepreneurial population with over 180 million people is what lured Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to Lagos's Yaba startup district in September last year. Generation Enterprise managing director Bunmi Otegbade, who helped get 30 entrepreneurs to pitch to Zuckerberg and President Muhammadu Buhari, believes the government's lack of support for the sector is not the problem. For Otegbade it's rather the country's poor infrastructure and shortage of good talent -- better software engineers and technical workers -- that is holding back the tech sector. \"The people in the tech system is the first problem. If we can improve them we can then work towards improving policies,\" he reckons. \"If there are investors in Nigeria who asked what needs to be done to find better deals, they would say you just need to work on improving the team behind the entrepreneur,\" he adds. Harsh business climate While the country is ranked by the World Bank at 169 on ease of doing business, Bunmi believes Nigerians have become used to operating in a harsh business environment, with few incentives for startups. For instance, businesses must start paying taxes from day one. Electricity is rarely stable. \"Most tech companies need to spend 40% (of revenue) on power revenue, compared to six percent in other countries,\" he says. But adds Otegbade: \"We have become so used to them (the problems) that we don't see them anymore\". 'Better government policies' However, Collins Onuegbu, from the Lagos Angels Network and executive vice chair of Signal Alliance, disagrees. He says better government policies can play a catalysing role in the initial surge of startups in Nigeria. \"Nigeria is currently trying to diversify its economy from oil. Tech is one of the areas of that diversification so we are hopeful that government involvement will allow the sector to keep its current trajectory and become a bigger contributor to the rebound of the Nigerian economy.\" He believes the worst of the recession that started last year is over and that foreign investment will start flowing back into the country soon. Investor confidence needed For Polish entrepreneur Marek Zmyslowski, who has been living in Lagos for over four years, there are no shortcuts -- Nigeria needs more educated customers and better competition. \"You don't just need more government support, you need investor confidence.\" For Zmyslowski, who runs software service for hotels called HotelOga, the state of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Nigeria is comparable to what it was in Poland 30 years ago. He says many Nigerian startups make the mistake of believing that they will acquire customers quickly online. However he says because not enough customers are online this is often not the case. For instance half his startup's marketing budget has gone on radio adverts or paying for sales agents at bus stations and airports. \"Many times we find it's the first purchase anyone has made online,\" he says. With the cost of internet so-called \"zombie phones\" are common -- where users turn off their data access to prevent apps from automatically updating and using up their expensive data. 'Fallen behind' But Nigeria wasn't always like this, argues Nigerian tech expert Emeka Okoye of Cymantics. Last month he said in an interview with Nigerian tech site Techpoint.ng that while Nigeria once sold software systems to US banks, the country has fallen behind such that it has no tech ecosystem. He says more must be done by the government and other roleplayers to get Nigerians to produce technologies rather than consume imported goods But Onuegbu chimes in that the press in Nigeria assume wrongly that tech entrepreneurship there is only a recent phenomenon. \"Over 20 years ago, a class of startups did exactly what Emeka described from a part of Lagos called Surulere. For some reason, most of these companies failed to scale and grow their businesses beyond their initial promise.\" Held back by state He says while Nigerians are an entrepreneurial people, the country has been held back by a government that focused on a one product, oil-based economy, adding that this has stifled creativity and entrepreneurship. \"The current struggles the economy is going through should be an opportunity to reset the country and its economy and build a future based on entrepreneurship and creative business development. \"I believe that this should not only benefit tech but every other sector that a country of 180 million people needs to help citizens enjoy better livelihood and  professional fulfilment.\" For entrepreneur Dayo Elegbe, who runs Lagos based mobile marketing startup Sponge, Nigeria is on the cusp of something big, He returned to Lagos after living and working for 20 years in the UK, because he says the opportunity was too great to forego. \"One of the reasons I came back is I'm an entrepreneur and I couldn't literally walk away from such a good opportunity. I came back to Nigeria and realised that this is going to be one of the biggest mobile markets in the world,\" says Elegbe. Ventureburn was unable to get in contact with anyone at the Nigerian Information Technology Development Agency. Last month Nigeria's Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Okechukwu Enelamah revealed that his ministry is working on plan for a digital economy which would create over three million jobs.

These are just some of the seven biotech and agricultural projects that will each receive seed funding of up to R500 000 from the Cape Craft and Design Institute (CCDI) in partnership with the Technology Innovation Agency's (TIA) seed fund and the Western Cape government's Department of Economic Development. CCDI executive director Erica Elk said at the announcement that an investment committee made up of experts from various sectors assessed the shortlisted applications in December and January. The seven projects were selected from 21 shortlisted candidates. A total of 57 applications were made when the application process opened in October last year. During the CCDI's first seed fund which ran from 2014 to last year, the non-profit worked with 12 firms, which generated R1.5-million in revenue over the period, created 18 jobs and leveraged an additional R10-million in funding. Elk said a key lesson from the organisation's first round was the need to work with individuals' sectors. The current round focuses on certain areas identified by both the national and provincial departments as growth sectors. These are: biotech, health, agro-processing and manufacturing. TIA acting seed fund head Vusi Skosana said the agency's seed fund is supporting 324 university projects with R142-million and 104 small business projects with R37-million. He added that the agency is looking to set up a rapid fund in which former seed fund participants will be able to get additional funding approved \"within 24 hours\" for development and projects costs. The seven projects to be supported are: The Optishunt -- A medical device to be developed by Daemon McClunan which uses a novel method to treat glaucoma.\nOranet -- An innovative method conceived by Woolf Katz to manufacture oak extract for use in the manufacture of wine and spirits.\nDNABurn -- A cellular molecular biology solution developed by Karim Dhanani of Signal Bioscience to help fight non-communicable diseases.\nFlyH2 -- A hydrogen-powered drone conceived by Mark van Wyk and Onno Huyser that releases lab-bred insects to wipe out pests.\nMicropatch -- A self-testing kit for HIV being put together by Incitech which was founded by Loretta Magagula, Dineo Lioma and two other alumni of the Allan Gray Orbis Foundation.\nSuction dissector -- A medical dissecting tool for soft tissue developed by Disa Vascular.\nSmartBlade -- An affordable video laryngoscope developed by Nick Levin and Caroline Corbett, which uses a smartphone.

Speaking in Cape Town, he said he and officials from the Western Cape government, including Finance MEC Ivan Meyer, were asked by the Reserve Bank to present to the bank on happenings in the Western Cape ecosystem and economy. The presentation took place last month and Winde said that it was the first time that his office has been asked to present to the Reserve Bank. \"And when they did their presentation, the presentation opened up with a discussion led by Silicon Cape and the kind of work that has been happening here by Webber Wenzel about how do we change IP and the rule around IP and the enabling environment so that our entrepreneurs can play a far more meaningful role.

However he stressed that SA entrepreneurs shouldn't sell their innovations and companies to foreign firms. \"We mustn't sell it to Silicon Valley or anywhere else. We must own it,\" he stressed.

This disruption, caused by many startups, could be leveraged by those same startups to scale. It's this mindset that the global cellular standards body, GSMA, has launched the Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund to help startups take advantage of the current disruption. \"Nevertheless, these mobile operators face a plethora of challenges. Sustainable competitive advantage in the telecommunications sector is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve. Likewise, while startups are vital forces in both the innovation ecosystem and the wider economy, the majority struggle to reach scale,\" the report stated. The fund will provide Asian and African startups with much-needed grant funding, technical assistance as well as the opportunity to partner with mobile operators within their markets. This assistance will help startups scale their products and services into sustainable businesses. The first round of the applications have already closed, however, the second round will open on 1 June 2017 with pitches due on 16 July 2017. \"We are extremely excited to start working with these innovative entrepreneurs, in particular, to help them explore synergies with mobile operators, and how to leverage mobile technology to its fullest to maximise socio-economic impact,\" said the head of the Ecosystem Accelerator Max Cuvellier in a press release. The first round winners of the Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund are: \"Today in emerging markets, more than anywhere else, there are opportunities for mobile operators and startups to collaborate,\" the report concluded.

Finfind CEO Darlene Menzies has been selected along with five other women by the World Economic Forum (WEF) as the continent's top female entrepreneurs. \"I think that we have a bit more of an advantage over men in this country in terms of starting a business from all the different accelerators and programmes,\" Menzies, whose web platform helps small businesses to source finance, told Ventureburn. Read more: Finfind initiative to link SA lenders with entrepreneurs seeking finance Menzies believes there are now more women in South Africa starting small businesses than there are women holding executive positions in the corporate world. \"I would encourage and challenge any women that the opportunities are awaiting them and that they should just get into them,\" she said. WEF searched for the top female entrepreneurs in tech to demonstrate and highlight the positive role they play in helping to drive growth, create employment as well as prepare their regions for more economic growth. During the search, hundreds of applications were sent in, during the search the top six emerged from all over Africa including SA, Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda. WEF set strict criteria for entrants. Eligible startups needed to be less than three-years old, show at least one year of revenue and have an innovative technology or business model operation. The selected entrepreneurs are: Commenting on how it felt to be one of the women recognised as the best in tech in Africa, Pandor said it was an honour to be listed. \"To be recognised on that level is a big honour, it's also a show of commitment from the WEF to want to understand and engage with businesses that apply their technology on the African continent.\" However, when it comes to equality in entrepreneurship, she feels that there's still a way to go. \"We're not there yet in terms of numbers and in terms of support that women get at the higher levels, so there is certainly a lot of work that needs to be done. \"But I feel very positive as a young female entrepreneur as to where my position will be in the next five to 10 years -- I feel like things will change in terms of numbers and percentages.\" Featured image: Jolanda Flaubacher via World Economic Forum Flickr (CC 2.0, resize) (Edited by Stephen Timm) ",

Sam Paddock (pictured on right), who is the company's CEO, said he and his co-founder and brother Rob weren't looking to be acquired. \"It became clear that joining forces would result in an organisation that could power the world's best digital education. This was too big an opportunity to pass on,\" he said. The deal, reported by Forbes magazine in an article yesterday includes an earn-out provision of as much as $20m in cash. Founded in 2008 by brothers Sam and Rob Paddock, GetSmarter delivers short-term online certification courses to distance-learning students in partnership with a number of top universities. Sam Paddock said while the deal was signed on Monday evening he expects it to close only on 3 July, adding that the entire executive team would remain with the company. When asked about how the deal was valued Paddock said this wasn't something he is able to disclose. He said GetSmarter has served over 57 000 students from 150 countries. \"We work on a revenue share model with our university partners,\" he added. \"There was a transaction (of $5m in venture-capital funding) with DiGame (and not Zouk as earlier reported by Forbes, he said) in 2016, but we didn't use it to fund our growth. We have bootstrapped the business entirely from founding. We have reinvested profits to fuel growth for many years. Forbes reported that the company last year made about $17m in sales and has about 400 employees, including performance coaches, technologists and video producers, as well as academic tutors that operate remotely around the world. Paddock said about 300 of these employees are fulltime, with the balance being part-time tutors and freelancers from around the world.

      "content": "Nigerian startup PiggyBank.ng and Kenyan startup Olivine Technology have each scored $50,000 in funding from investment firm Village Capital, following the conclusion of FinTech Africa 2017, a three-month investment readiness programme. The programme was organised in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation and the DOEN Foundation with support from VC4A. The two companies were a part of a cohort of seven peer companies. PiggyBank.ng allows Nigerians to save small sums of money through an automatic savings process by working directly with financial institutions, while Olivine Technology has created ASiM, a mobile app that serves as a point-of-sale and stock management solution that connects multiple distribution sites seamlessly with their respective head offices. Participating entrepreneurs were involved in a peer-selected investment process which allowed them to evaluate one another across multiple investment readiness indicators, directing the investment award to the top two companies. Olivine Technology co-founder Joseph Karanja said the funding would be ploughed back into the business. He said the startup, launched in 2010 by Karanja, Mark Mwaura and Charles Muigai, has gained some traction with its smartphone app, and has picked up clients in the cosmetics, fuel lubricants, beverage and edible products sectors. Karanja said the product would help business managers to replace handwritten sales receipts from sales people and distributors, while assisting managers to view where sales are being made geographically. Village Capital CEO Ross Baird (pictured above) said in a press release that the company had seen growing financial access in Africa over the last several years, but that growing access did not necessarily translate to growing financial inclusion. \"There is a real lack of savings, credit, and investment solutions that work for women, youth, farmers, small businesses, and other underserved communities. \"After witnessing the progress of the FinTech Africa 2017 cohort companies over the past several months, we're even more excited about their potential to expand financial inclusion in the communities they serve,\" said Baird. The remainder of the cohort included: \"We have been proud to work with Village Capital to identify and support the next generation of FinTech entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa,\" said Youssouf Sy, associate programme manager for the Mastercard Foundation.

VB: The FSB completed a report looking at equity crowdfunding regulation. When was it completed? What did the report broadly contain?\nCDS: The research we conducted was aimed at giving us insight on how crowdfunding is regulated in other jurisdictions and what legislation would govern crowdfunding activities in SA. VB: Is the FSB studying or planning to study equity crowdfunding regimes of any particular countries?\nCDS: We looked at crowdfunding activities in the Netherlands and other European countries, India, Kenya, New Zealand and the US. VB: What consultations has the FSB held so far and with which industry groups?\nCDS: We have engaged the Africa Crowdfunding Association. VB: Is the FSB allowing Wealth Migrate and ThundaFund to trial equity crowdfunding under a special dispensation?\nCDS: No, the FSB has not allowed anyone, platform or entity to trial equity crowdfunding. VB: What steps will be taken now by the FSB over the coming months to decide whether SA needs regulations on equity crowdfunding or not?\nCDS: The final phase of the project would include the following:\n(1) A demonstration of crowdfunding business models by members of the Africa Crowdfunding Association.\n(2) Consideration on whether we should test equity crowdfunding in a sandbox environment. The FSB anticipates that it would be in a position to communicate progress in this regard to the industry should there not be a need for more consultation with affected stakeholders.

      "content": "Accelerator programme Innotribe has chosen 10 startups for the third edition of the Startup Challenge Africa, for secure financial messaging provider Swift's African Regional Conference which takes place in Abidjan, in the Ivory Coast, later this month. The 10 were selected after 100 judges evaluated close to 100 applications. Applications came from a number of African countries with SA, Nigeria and Kenya filling up most of the positions. \"It is a pleasure for us to see the number of African startups applying to our programme growing year after year. Their calibre continues to impress, and there is no doubt they are going to play an important role in shaping the future of finance,\" said Fabian Vandenreydt, Innotribe's global head of securities markets and head of the Swift Institute, in a press release to Ventureburn. Participating startups are as follows: These startups will be pitching their new products on 17 May in front of hundreds of delegates from more than 40 countries, during Swift's African Regional Conference. This will also serve as a platform for the startups to network with potential investors, partners and customers. The selected startups will undergo coaching sessions in Abidjan with top entrepreneurs to prepare them for their pitching day. Once the selected startups have concluded with their pitches the audience will vote for who they thought were the top three startups. The top three will then go on to Sibos, Swift's global financial services conference which will take place from 16 to 19 October in Toronto, Canada. At Sibos, the winning startups will receive a $10 000 cash prize as well as share the stage with other FinTech experts to share their innovations and insights happening in Africa. \"The Startup Challenge is an enriching experience for all participating companies. They benefit from expert mentoring and get that much-needed exposure to financial institutions,\" said Vandenreydt. ",

      "content": "Silicon Valley based SA entrepreneur Vinny Lingham says he plans to open an office in Cape Town to hire developers for his new startup Civic, following reforms to South Africa's Intellectual Property (IP) control regulations. \"The Reserve Bank by listening to the community and making the changes (to the IP control rules) have opened it up to more foreign investments,\" Lingham said in a Skype call with Ventureburn from San Francisco on Friday last week. Lingham recently posted a link of Civic's Facebook account saying the startup is looking to hire in South Africa. It follows an announcement by then Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan in the Budget Speech in February that the IP exchange control would be relaxed. With the relaxation of exchange control, the SA Reserve Bank would allow certain authorised dealers to process cross-border IP transactions on its behalf. Read more: Startups take note: an update on IP control Lingham said previously it had been a complicated, \"messy\" and expensive process for any SA entrepreneur based overseas who wanted to set up an SA office for their company. \"The law prevented South Africans from investing back home,\" he added. \"Previously to set up an office in South Africa we had to have a separate company which is unaffiliated with the US company because I am a shareholder of the US company and I'm still a South African citizen.\" Lingham was not sure yet how many jobs Civic would add at the Cape Town office. \"We'll start up with a handful and we'll grow the office and as we expand into South Africa we will be able to invest locally there as well,\" he said. He said setting up an SA office was a good bet. \"There's great talent in South Africa and with the exchange rate as it is we don't see it coming back, so it's good value for money.\" He said he was in the process of applying for exchange control approval to set up the SA office. \"I've got some people on the ground who are doing it in Cape Town. They're working with the Reserve Bank and they'll be working with people there,\" he added. Lingham said he will launch his new startup Civic on 25 May at blockchain conference Consensus in New York. He said that a poll he ran on Twitter a few weeks ago saw 85% of respondents indicate that they wanted the product. He said the service would primarily be consumer driven, while some partner companies had already agreed to accept the service. The product will allow users to share information such as users' social security or identity number securely from any device with digital signatures that certify that the validity of the information hasn't been tampered with. Civic is working with a number of governments at present, although Lingham declined to say which governments these are. \"We give you a way to securely store that information on a device with cryptographic keys which guarantee that (the identity) is you, and so the person who is receiving the information can trust that it's you...\" \"We basically sign your information... and if it comes from your device it's you and when it comes from someone else it's not.\" Lingham says he and his team have been testing the product for 18 months now. \"We don't store data on our servers so there's no backdoor in... It's all on your device and it's all stored on your device using Apple's and Android's protocol.\" He says his product will decentralise the storage of data, such that one has to have physical possession of any device to appropriate the information. \"The thing is this -- if someone hacks a bank they can steal 20 million IDs. With us they can't because they don't hold it (the information). They can hack your device and get it, but they need to have physical access to it.\" Click here for the link to Civic job positions in South Africa.

      "content": "South African Peter Bauer, who just over 18 months ago listed his email management startup Mimecast on the Nasdaq, once turned down a R30 000 offer for his then business in the late 1990s, only to sell it a few months later for R20-million. Mimecast, which Bauer started in 2003 with fellow South African Neil Murray, listed on the Nasdaq in November 2015. The company's stock price has since doubled and trades at about $24 per share, bringing its total market cap to $1.2-billion. In the late 1990s, after selling his stake in a school stationery and goods supplier and after having travelled a bit and completed a Microsoft engineering course, Bauer started a tech business developing niche software and applications for corporates. \"We were running on scant liquidity again, and so were very tempted when less than a year into it, we were made an offer,\" he explains. It was from a larger IT company who wanted the business for R30 000. He and his two partners decided to hold out for R40 000. The would-be acquirer called their bluff, and headed back to Johannesburg with a closed chequebook. \"18 months later the dot-com ridiculousness was in full swing, and we sold for R20m,\" he added. But he explains that they only got to that point because the three were able to secure funding from friends and family. \"We each did what it took to bring R100 000 in. My dad had just retired as a teacher, and kindly gave me a meaningful portion of his retirement fund.\" In 2002 Bauer left for the UK with the proceeds from the R20m sale he made on his then tech business, intending to export South African tech services to a hard currency market, and profit take on the arbitrage. It never panned out, as he met Neil Murray, and within a year Mimecast was born to fill the gaps they saw in the state of email security and archiving offerings. His own capital had been dented by the failed software exporting venture, so the two never had buckets of money to start. \"The need for money shouldn't be at the expense of control, he believes. \"We ran very lean for years,\" he says. \"At Mimecast, we only got formal venture capital six years in. It came from Index Ventures, and it was very helpful, but we were able to negotiate it largely on our terms.\" In this and subsequent rounds, the two exchanged capital for reduced-voting stock. Bauer and Murray wanted to maintain control of their business, and they had a view on how it should grow, and at what pace. \"We could probably have sold Mimecast for $300m in 2013, and it would obviously have been the wrong route.\" Had the two not maintained control, the billion-dollar valuation that eventually came may well not have materialised. \"Things can get wrong-headed quickly, and it's important to stand firm and play the long game if that's what you've decided.\" He advises that founders understand the benefits of control, but not at the expense of growth. \"Retain control, structure properly, take on capital very carefully in order to grow.\" On the question of why he left South Africa, he says, \"It wasn't driven by the smallness of the South African market. But I had just come out of what was, for us, a huge exit, and I wanted to move into an environment where I would have to learn, stay sharp and start again.\" He says he fielded similar questions when he and Murray decided -- because of the bigger bang it would make -- to list on the Nasdaq and not in London where Mimecast was based. \"I always tell people Mimecast is a global company, with London roots, and a South African background. I think South Africa would benefit from more South African businesses thinking of themselves as global -- or potentially global -- from the outset.\" Bauer also recalls how he dropped out of a business and marketing course during his  first year to pursue a business supplying South African Model C schools stationery and other goods. His partner was older, wiser and had an MBA, and they bootstrapped the business out of a Cape Town garage. \"I learnt very quickly how to optimise limited capital,\" he recalls. \"Founding with a partner is better than going it alone, but I learnt some important lessons about what to look for and avoid in a co-founder. \"The business succeeded, but I never fully realised the difference between ownership and employment, so when my partner pressured me to sell my equity to him for a bigger share of the year's profits, I went for it. Once the realisation set in, and we fell out, I left.\" He says he was devastated at the time, \"but if it hadn't happened, I'd probably be the king of the Western Cape school supplies game now, so it was for the best\".

      "content": "Mentors can prove invaluable to entrepreneurs looking to grow their business as they can impart important knowledge and act as an important guide in the lonely world of starting a business. So says Alexandra Fraser, director of Silicon Cape and a Barclay's Rise mentor -- one of a number of Barclay's Rise Techstars mentors who spoke to Ventureburn on the benefits of mentorship, following the announcement earlier this month of the accelerator's next cohort of startups. Read more: Barclays accelerator announces latest participants in African programme Fraser said networks and relationships, much like ones you make with mentors are important, particularly when you're an entrepreneur. \"Being an entrepreneur is a fairly lonely journey and it's a hard journey, it's not a walk in the park, so I think the other thing about mentorship is that it keeps morale high. \"It encourages you and allows you to build connections with people who've done it before and for them to know that even though it's not an easy journey it's a fulfilling journey and you've got a support structure.\" Venture partner at Quonna Capital Johan Bosini echoed this, pointing to the importance of surrounding oneself not just with those you just, but with people who are different to you, as diversity can give you a fresh perspective on things. \"Historically it's just been each to his own and there seems to be, through programmes like this, a more collaborative approach to 'if one succeeds we actually all succeed as a community' rather than individually trying to beat each other,\" said Bosini. He has some tough advice for many budding entrepreneurs. \"I've always said to a lot of people starting out that it's the worst idea you'll ever have starting a new business. But, if you're insistent on doing it I would say talk to everybody and anybody even your competitors because it gives you a perspective and context in terms of where you are and validation.\" Fraser stresses that the relationships one builds as a mentor with startups are important. \"From a mentor perspective, it allows you to learn about new businesses, it allows you to learn about a new innovation, it allows you to think about technologies and how they're being applied. There's always a learning opportunity from being a mentor.\" Fraser added that being a mentor also allows one to give back and to build a community, and is a way to \"hopefully give before you get\". Parcelninja co-founder Justin Drennan also shared some of his experiences mentoring the previous group of Techstars. \"Last year was quite interesting in that we had a lot of international people mingled with our SA startups, so it was quite a cosmopolitan bunch which I think led to a lot of cross-pollination of ideas between a lot of the businesses.\" He recalled how he was able to get some of the participants' businesses market-ready. \"We (the mentors) got to add to that process and I think that a lot of experiences that we've had from being in business for let's say 10 years; we were able to distill and assist these businesses in a way that was productive for them.\" Read more: Do you want to be a mentor? These 5 tips will help One of his methods to assist the entrepreneurs is to help them come to their answers on their own using examples of past experiences. \"We try to share a lot of experiences we have in business and see if they can sort of pick up on that and learn and I think if they have access to competent mentors that can sort of shortcut the learnings then for all of the 'school fees' we've paid they can sort of benefit from that.\" Drennan said being a mentor requires you to participate fully in a startup, but pointed out that if you're giving by nature then the experience is fulfilling. \"At the same time I think it's something that needs to be done, entrepreneurship is something that needs to be embraced and we need to help people out that are starting a business,\" he said. \"I think that's the future of our economy, these people that are starting up businesses and they need people, mentors and individuals to help them accelerate that (growth) process. You can't have nine out of 10 businesses failing.\"   ",

      "content": "\"It was crazy, getting accepted into an accelerator held by Google of all companies -- we didn't expect it,\" recalls Vibescout co-founder Jonathan Myburgh, on being accepted into the Google Launchpad Accelerator last month. Myburgh told Ventureburn how getting accepted into the programme proved a great \"morale\" boost for he and his team from the event and content aggregator startup. Vibescout was conceived by Jonathan's brother and co-founder of the company, Paul Myburgh, while on a trip to Vietnam in 2014. Jonathan recalls how at the time his brother had exhausted all the available tourist activities and wanted to do what the locals were doing. But he couldn't find any information on how the locals liked to spend their time. His only source of information at the time were hotel brochures and fliers. Paul then approached his brother with the idea of creating a possible solution to solve this problem. It was then in 2015 that Vibescout was born. Two years on Vibescout was accepted into Google's world-renowned accelerator. Read more: Google's Launchpad Start to empower African SMEs \"The Launchpad experience was amazing. They really went all out with how they arranged the event, they handled all admin related to travel for the startups completely, the programmes were well planned and the quality of the mentors they arranged to interact with us in one-on-one sessions was invaluable,\" he said. Jonathan said the accelerator provided him and his brother with much needed time away from the day-to-day routine of the business, allowing them to focus on the fundamentals for their startup. The biggest lesson they took away was how to run a design sprint and effectively get the best user feedback, he said. \"We also got to sit down with a Google expert and take a critical look at the back-end of our system. They helped us reduce our server costs with Google by 40%, as well as to improve the overall speed of the platform.\" Vibescout also had the opportunity to interact with mentors such as Chris Grant, a senior director at King; Angus Brown of eBucks as well as ProSiebenSat.1 Accelerator MD Jens Pippig. \"The input they were able to give on specific challenges based on their experience was priceless for us,\" said Jonathan. Read more: Q&A: Google's John Kimani on Launchpad Start Jonathan said he and his brother were able to some great conversations with other startups on the programme about things such as their tech and marketing strategies. His only criticism of the programme was that the organisers tried to cover too wide a variety of topics within the space of just a week. \"If the programme was less 'one-size-fits-all' and took a more personal or targeted approach to some of the startup's needs, it could have been a bit more effective,\" he said.

      "content": "South Africa has been in hot water politically and economically after the country's credit rating was downgraded to \"junk status\" earlier this month. Despite this the local currency has shown resilience and economists believe that policy changes should steer the country towards a recovery. According to its central bank governor, the country is still attracting capital flows which should be good news for South Africa's tech scene. Africa, as a continent, has a growing tech scene with 314 active tech hubs. South Africa leads the continent with 54, according to a recent graphic by GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator. But if there's a tech scene South Africa can learn from, it's Poland's. Poland has positioned itself as the major tech hub of central and eastern Europe (CEE). Its roster of companies with multi-million dollar valuations is growing. Here are six lessons South Africa can learn from Poland's tech scene: Poland produces top tech talent. Computing is part of the curricula at all levels. Programming website HackerRank puts Poland at third globally as the country with the best developers. This hasn't been gone unnoticed by other major startups. Lower labour costs and an English-speaking population has enabled Poland to become a major outsourcing destination for software development work for companies in the US and UK. Polish software companies have made software-as- a-service (SaaS) their niche. SaaS allows these tech companies to have worldwide presence without having to worry about cross-border distribution or putting physical presence abroad. There is a wide array of services catering to both B2B and B2C markets. Among some notable SaaS brands include social media monitoring service Brand24, social  listening tool SentiOne and development platform SaaS Manager. Polish entrepreneurs also insist on building sustainable businesses. While there are active venture capital funds and angel investors active in Poland's tech hubs, most entrepreneurs insist on funding themselves. This allows their businesses to be profitable from the start rather than worry about making an exit to make money. South Africa has yet to produce its own unicorn. Perhaps Poland's best known billion-dollar companies are game developer CD Projekt and ecommerce auction site Allegro. Nurturing a homegrown unicorn can open up more opportunities. It communicates that the country continues to be a viable place for business and it also create prospects for spin-offs. Email marketing platform GetResponse, which now has more than 250 000 active users including enterprises such as Avon, Hilton, and Citroen, has enjoyed positive business and eventually spun off new services such as ClickMeeting. Part of cultivating the scene is presenting it as a regional hub. This includes hosting global events that gathers industry and thought leaders in the region. Poland is host to two of the biggest tech events - Pipeline Summit and InfoShare. These events draw developers, entrepreneurs and investors together and playing host to such events position the country as the epicenter of tech activities. It is also important to be the gateway for a bigger market. Poland has been that for the CEE. There's a reason why Google elected to put up a campus in Warsaw - it's the search giant's foothold for the rest of CEE. Since the move, Google has unveiled programs to fuel tech development in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic through is Warsaw campus. South Africa already enjoys being the gateway for business in the region in general. Nairobi and Kenya are also making strides in their tech scenes so there are contenders to South Africa's position. It's time for South Africa to refocus that image for tech. Ultimately, the challenge lies in the tech startups themselves. With such a troubled economy, it is critical to consider sustainable growth rather than rely on venture capital and exits. By bootstrapping and focusing on innovation, there's always the chance for a big break for any of SA's startups.

      "content": "SA entrepreneur Stephen Larkin claims that investors could be in for \"free cash\" of US$20-billion if his exploration company, which uses a unique algorithm to pinpoint possible gas deposits, makes a find in Namibia's Kalahari Desert. While he's raised millions of dollars from investors and written off millions more in research costs through a number of state incentives, industry analysts remain cautious. Read more: Will South African trio's algorithm be a boon for oil sector? His UK-registered company Africa New Energies, which is expected to list on the London Stock Exchange next year, has yet to discover a single barrel of oil. Larkin launched the company in 2012 with Brendon Raw and Shakes Motsilili. At a Startup Grind event at Workshop 17 in Cape Town last night, Ventureburn questioned Larkin on the concern some analysts have over the company's claims it would find gas in the basin. He said since registering his company in 2012 a number of local Herero people have reported oil seeping out of 731 places across a million acres in the basin. However he stressed that while drilling was expected to start next year, the existence of any gas deposits in the Kalahari had not yet been proven. Despite this, he said the use of an algorithm -- which combines satellite images, aircraft photos and other data to determine such things as the depth and pressure of any gas -- can greatly increase the chances of a successful find, while keeping costs low. Based on its use in 100 basins and 6000 wells, the algorithm gave prospectors about a 70% chance of finding gas, he said. \"I'm not saying we'll get 70% (certainty)...  you'll get to the 70% probability over a 10 well-drilling programme,\" he said. \"But the bizarre thing is because the expected value of what we're talking about and we're talking free cash of US$20 billion, they (investors) are prepared to say, 'well if it doesn't work we're prepared to lose a certain amount'.\" Those that have helped fund the exploration include 400 investors from 17 countries who have committed R40-million, after Larkin raised an initial R1-million from 30 former school mates. The company has also raised about 2.5 million pounds (US$3.2-million) in the UK, he added. He also revealed to Ventureburn that Chinese investors are expected to put in a further $500-million, which will form the company's initial listing value. In addition to this, the company has also been able tap funding from South Africa's Support Programme for Industrial Innovation (SPII) fund, which falls under the Department of Trade and Industry, while having utilised research and development (R&D) tax credits in the UK after registering the company there. Added to this the company has received support from the German government, a deal in which Larkin says the German government will cover three quarters of the company's budgeted R&D spend but in which the company will be able to maintain ownership of its IP. He says the recent low oil price has driven interest by investors in the company's algorithm. \"What has amazed me is that we are starting to get bids where certain players are starting to get worried, because it's cheaper and it's better if it works. \"And a couple of them have got to a stage where they are trying to secure the algorithm before we strike. Because if we do there will be such a bunfight over it.\" However when questioned later by Ventureburn, Larkin admitted that there are other operators in existence that are using similar algorithms to prospect for oil. In response to an audience question on whether the company would use hydraulic fracturing to recover gas deposits, Larkin said he \"loathed\" fracking and added that his algorithm \"will destroy the economic justification for fracking\". However when probed further by Ventureburn on whether fracking would be involved in recovering the gas, he agreed that while it would be deployed, the algorithm would however limit the number of test wells that would need to be drilled. Larkin said he was contacted in 2011 by the then Namibian foreign minister Utoni Nujoma to build a solar park. However after carrying out a pre-feasibility study Africa New Energies advised that solar would be financially unsustainable. It's then, he says, that the company hit on the idea of prospecting for onshore gas to pay for the installation of solar. As a child Larkin, who is dyslexic, was told that he would need to go to a special school. But he said his scientist father would hear none of it. While at Marist Brothers College in Cape Town, a former headmaster of Bishops spotted his potential and offered him a chance to write a scholarship exam to enter the prestigious private school. The night before the final exam, his sister was beaten and thrown into prison by police who suspected her of being involved in radical left-wing politics at the time. \"She was in prison when I wrote that exam and I just let rip with left-wing vitriolic that would have made Karl Marx wince.\" Larkin was in luck because the regular marker, who was a conservative Afrikaner, was off work that day. \"They desperately needed to find someone to mark the exams and they found this hippy guy from the UK and he read this paper and he thought, 'wow this is alternative' and despite my four percent for Latin I won a Bishops scholarship.\" He recalls the time when his fellow room mate at his University of Cape Town residence, who was from one of the country's former homelands, told him that what he was most looking forward to doing at the university was studying at night. \"That day he basically made me work out what I wanted to do -- I wanted to give everyone else who didn't have electricity, electricity,\" he said. I was there and I do not remember Stephen saying that he will be fracking, do you have video fooage of him saying? Ventureburn focuses on startup news and technology trends in emerging markets.

The MEST, incubator and entrepreneurial school tech, is part of the MeltWater group. It is the flagship of the Ghanaian tech ecosystem. \"This agreement, which is the first in our bilateral relations, shows the increasing role of France in the digitisation of Africa. In the case of Ghana, young entrepreneurs have been and will be invited to France in order to support innovation,\" said Pujolas. The signing of the agreement comes as France hosts Station F, the largest incubator in the world, with French digital operators already present in Africa within the French Tech hubs of Abidjan, in the Ivory Coast and Cape Town, South Africa. PARIS&Co prospects and provides support for foreign direct investments and promotes the international attractiveness of Paris abroad. In addition the agency fosters the Parisian innovation ecosystem by incubating startups and organising events between startups and global players. As part of the \"France and Ghana 1957-2017: moving forward together\" initiative, which runs from 1 to 9 June, the French embassy and its network of partner institutions are planning to organise several digital events in Ghana dubbed The French Digital June. The events include a French language hackathon and a two-day forum on \"Ghanaian Tech\" and the \"French digital\", which will close with an exhibition at Alliance Francaise Accra. ",

      "content": "Andi Friedman is feeling \"energised and excited\" following a R16-million investment his startup Mobenzi received from Vumela Fund. Friedman said the Series-A funding served as a good recognition of all the hard work the company has done. He said the fund, which is managed by FNB and Edge Growth, took a significant minority stake in Mobenzi. The startup clinched the investment after taking part in one-on-one mentoring with accelerator and capital advisory firm Impact Amplifier. The accelerator provided the company with strategic support as well as other acceleration services. Mobenzi was founded in 2009 by Friedman and Pete Fowles. The two have developed a suite of products which include a range of flexible mobile apps and software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms. This suit can rapidly be configured to apply to a variety of sectors. Mobenzi's platform is aimed at those who work directly with customers and enables mobile interactions such as data collection and case management. The platform is also by nature, self-service while still providing a solid foundation for flexible turnkey solutions. An example of this is the Community Health Worker Service used in the Western Cape and the North West. \"We are excited to have the Vumela Team on board. We are at a critical stage of our growth, and having a long-term partner, which can help us scale and is aligned with our social mission, is imperative,\" said Friedman, earlier in a press release to Ventureburn. Impact Amplifier partner Maximilian Pichulik said Mobenzi will use the investment to help the company to build their suite of products and accelerate their expansion internationally. Pichulik said the accelerators was attracted by Mobenzi's commercial scalability and the company's strong focus and talented team. Edge Growth fund head Richard Rose added that the startup is an exciting addition to the fund's investment portfolio. \"Their software solutions will be a powerful enabler for job creation, and be globally competitive with the best out there.\" Featured image: James Lee via Flickr (CC 2.0, resize) ",

      "content": "The South African Breweries (SAB) Foundation is calling on social entrepreneurs who are involved in assisting disadvantaged South Africans, to apply for its Social Innovation and Disability Empowerment Awards. The awards are split into two categories: The application process opens early next month and can be completed by visiting the SAB Foundation website. \"We define social innovation as innovation that demonstrates both a sustainable business model and a measurable social impact,\" said SAB Foundation director Bridgit Evans in a press release to Ventureburn. Once the application process has been concluded, a panel of judges will be assessing the entrants to evaluate whether or not they're innovative and applicable to the lives of the disadvantaged. Once the judges have gone through applications, the best 25 applicants will be selected who will then be invited to attend a two-day workshop in September. Participants will then be asked to present their solutions and products to the judges. Based on the presentations, the judges will select the final winners who will be announced at an awards ceremony on 19 October. \"In the past seven years of the Social Innovation Awards we have been impressed with the quality and calibre of ideas and businesses that we have been presented with, over many fields and industries, including health, education, environment, community cohesion and more,\" said Evans. The awards' prize money ranges from R150,000 to R1.2-million, additional prizes may also be awarded on the night of the ceremony at the judges' discretion. In addition to the prizes, each winner will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and be placed into a programme with a specially selected mentor and technical expert. \"We hope to see many more applicants entering this year, so we can help take their ideas to the next level,\" said Evans. Previous winner, Thato Kgatlhanye from Repurpose Schoolbags said the SAB Foundation gave her startup seed capital to invest in machinery and train staff in the pilot and prototyping phase of the innovation. \"The funding helped us establish operations in buying quality machinery that we are still using to this day. Our operations grew, we moved from a 50sqm factory to a 200sqm factory, and we currently export product lines to countries such as Austria, UK and Turkey.\" Featured image via YouTube ",

      "content": "The World Bank has announced the launch of XL Africa, an acceleration programme aimed at supporting 20 top digital startups from Sub-Saharan Africa. XL Africa will run over five months and startups will be put through a tailored curriculum, while receiving mentorship and the chance to attract early-stage capital of between US$250,000 and US$1.5-million. \"Digital startups are important drivers of innovation in Africa,\" said Makhtar Diop, the vice-president for the Africa Region at the World Bank, in a press release. \"To scale and spread new technologies and services beyond borders, they need an integrated ecosystem that provides access to regional markets and global finance. \"Pan-African initiatives like XL Africa play a critical role by linking local start-ups with corporations and investors across the continent,\" said Diop. The programme will kick off with a two-week residency in Cape Town where the selected startups will be able to interact with mentors, peers and local partners. The residency will then conclude with a venture showcase in which entrepreneurs will present their business models before an audience of corporations and investors. \"XL Africa aims to put a spotlight on the continent's growing digital economy by scouting for and supporting the most innovative tech startups,\" said Klaus Tilmes, the director of Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice at the World Bank. \"The success of these ventures will create a demonstration effect that can attract much needed growth investment in the sector and catalyse scaling of transnational businesses in the region,\" said Tilmes. XL Africa will collaborate with African investment groups such as the African Business Angel Network (ABAN), AngelHub Ventures, Goodwell Investments and Knife Capital. The accelerator will also be collaborating with Nest Africa, Silvertree Capital, Singularity Investments, SA Business Angel Network (SABAN) and many others. Corporate partners include Orange, .Eco, Ringier, and Thomson Reuters. \"By connecting innovative business ideas with the knowledge and resources available in the ecosystem, XL Africa will create a pipeline of investment-ready companies, unlocking better investment opportunities for regional and global investors,\" said Lexi Novitske, the principal investment officer for Singularity Investments. Companies wishing to apply can do so online before 12 June. ",

      "content": "Computicket's acquisition of local company Entry Ninja is an opportunity to take on new technology and to learn more, says the Pretoria startup's co-founder Frans Jooste. \"It's a lot of fun to see your product blowing up,\" Jooste, 29, told Ventureburn today on Computicket's purchase of the online sporting events portal. \"It's like seeing your baby growing up.\" Computicket on Saturday announced that it has acquired the startup for an undisclosed sum. Neither Jooste or Shoprite Holdings, which owns Computicket, would disclose the amount of the deal. Jooste said the startup was approached in May last year by the ticketing company, which was looking at expanding into sporting events. \"They (Computicket) took a look at our product and said they liked what they saw,\" he added. He said the idea is to integrate Entry Ninja into Computicket's online portal and its 1000 ticketing outlets. While Computicket has said it wanted five founders to remain in the company, Jooste said he and his partners were still \"smoothing out\" the details around their involvement going forward. \"From our side we just want to continue growing emotionally, mentally and financially,\" he added. Since starting out two and a half years ago, Entry Ninja has handled booking for about 460 events, mainly obstacle course and road running races like the Joburg 10k Cityrun and FNB Cape Town 12 Onerun. Jooste said Entry Ninja has its roots in a timing company started six years ago when his cousin -- co-founder Francois Jooste, 28 -- and his father were organising local sports events and battled to find a good company to handle the timing. It's then that the approached Frans, who was studying software development at the University of Pretoria at the time. He was joined by then fellow students Phillip Buys, 28 and Jaco van der Berg, 27. They then joined up with the founders of a local GPS timing company, before they split in 2014. The four along with George Boot, 25, formed Entry Ninja. which was registered the following year. While things began slowly, Buys helped the startup to secure the Toyota Warrior obstacle course race involving 10 000 weekend participants. \"That's when things boomed,\" said Jooste. From their initial focus on timing, the five turned to focus more on events booking which Jooste describes as more scalable than timing, which relies on timekeepers on the ground to expand. Despite this, the company timed 152 events last year, with timings captured using electronic tags. His advice to other entrepreneurs is to focus on one's core business and ensure one has tested one's idea thoroughly before adding any more products or services. \"Don't just try to build everything from day one -- try to pick three things and try to master them,\" he pointed out. Shoprite Holdings Deputy Chief Operating Officer Joseph Bronn said in a press release that the company had been actively looking to extend into event registration to better service its customers. \"Entry Ninja's service extends to different types of sporting events, plus it makes allowance for team entries and even offers event organisers a timing facility. \"It really is a one-stop solution,\" said Bronn.

      "content": "South Africa's downgrade to junk status earlier this month by two rating agencies may have depressed Michael Jordaan, one of the country's most respected venture capital (VC) investors, but he believes the downgrade is \"nearly irrelevant\" to startups. \"In this tough economic climate it is useful that one of the advantages of startups as opposed to big business is that the macro economics are nearly irrelevant as it is far more important for the startup to first succeed in its narrowly defined micro-market,\" said Jordaan in an email to Ventureburn. However, in a wide-ranging interview, the former head of First National Bank, now the founder of Montegray Capital, bemoaned the present glum economic mood in South Africa. He said the current political situation and the junk rating depressed him, adding that the economy could \"easily\" grow at 5% if \"the right, albeit sometimes tough decisions\" were taken. \"We could be creating so many jobs every year if we just followed growth strategies that have worked elsewhere instead of being ideological,\" he added. \"For example solar power is growing exponentially elsewhere but in sunny SA we seem intent on doing an unaffordable nuclear deal. And we pour money into a loss-making airline that the private sector could run at a profit.\" Jordaan said though he has had no interaction with the SA SME Fund he found it disappointing that the fund, chaired by Discovery CEO Adrian Core, appears to be taking its time to set up and begin investing. Read more: Exclusive: 'Government won't match private sector in R1.5bn SME fund' \"Ideally they should have been disbursing funds within 90 days of coming up with the concept, probably by partnering (with) established VCs in the industry who are all seeing more promising deals than they can fund,\" he said. He added that the government's decision not to participate in the fund is \"highly regrettable\", saying startups are crucial to solving SA's biggest problems, from employment to education. However he believed the Section 12J venture capital tax incentive launched in 2009 had made a difference and hoped that the \"inevitable\" teething problems with would be addressed. Jordaan said Montegray Capital has invested in 20 businesses, with 19 already listed on the fund's website. He added that the latest investment would be announced in due course so as not to alert the competition yet. He declined to disclose the size of his fund or how much he had invested so far, pointing out that he had no third-party investors and was managing his own monies. He could not disclose the number of directors or jobs created as he did no track these, but added that \"the first priority of every startup is just to survive so we focus obsessively on proving the business model, which is tough enough\". The fund, he said, is not exit-focused and added that he simply wanted to help entrepreneurs to build sustainable businesses. \"Some of the companies in which we have invested have raised subsequent funding in higher rounds but without us taking any money off the table. We prefer it that way too,\" he said. However he said all the tech firms that he is involved with are creating jobs and are continually looking for skilled employees. \"The biggest skills shortage is for software developers and I am very proud that one of our initiatives, CodeX is training 40 junior developers in 2017. With more industry support the model can easily scale to 400 or even 4000 in time. \"These are students from underprivileged areas that prove that they have the critical thinking and problem-solving skills required to become great developers and employees, despite a pretty bad primary and secondary education system.\" He said while there had been a growth in black Africans involved in tech startups, this was \"sadly off a low base\". \"In time CodeX hopes to make a difference here,\" he added. In addition he said the country should be more open to letting in foreigners with skills that can grow the economy. \"It is sad when our policies have scarcity thinking -- that skilled foreigners will take locals' jobs -- and not abundance -- that thriving businesses create many more new jobs,\" he said. Cape Town and Johannesburg have been recognised as the country's top startup centres, but Jordaan said rather than trying to mimic these cities, authorities from other urban centres in the country would benefit more by adding to the network effect that the two cities have already created. Jordaan is also involved in VC fund Angelhub Ventures and said the team receives and processes up to 10 applications a day. \"There is simply not enough time to have coffee with all the prospective startup founders so we have to follow a slightly more structured process, which is where Angelhub excels,\" he said. Recalling his first two venture deals, which he conducted when he was still employed, Jordaan said these \"did not work out\", adding that he'd rather not mention the companies involved. \"It takes quite a bit of (lost) money to educate a venture capitalist. Failure is inherent in startups and in the venture capital industry, so it is very different from banking where a four percent bad debt ratio would set off the alarm bells. \"Venture capitalists expect five out of 10 investments to go bang, three out of 10 to do okay but then have two that shoot the lights out,\" he said. With Jordaan's former employer FNB this week cutting its economic growth outlook for South Africa to 0.7% in 2017, down from the 1.3% forecast in the Budget in February, he will likely be hoping that the investing outlook won't prove as gloomy as the country's deteriorating economy.

      "content": "Digital All Stars is a series of articles which aims to celebrate the best of South African digital. The articles, which will appear on Memeburn and Ventureburn, recognise and celebrate South Africa's best digital entrepreneurs, business people, advertisers, and media professionals among others. In this piece we take a look at some interesting African startups involved in developing artificial intelligence (AI) solutions.  South African startup DataProphet last year received a significant investment of an undisclosed amount from Yellowwoods Capital Holdings to expand its international offering. As part of the deal, DataProphet will act as the advanced analytics partner for the group. The startup, based in Cape Town, has developed various machine-learning interventions, mainly for the finance and insurance sector. It has also added a number of large industrial and fast-moving consumer goods clients, some of which are international clients. Among the applications the startup has designed are a conversational agent for inquiries and a solution to detect emotion via image which has been integrated into a game for major Japanese publisher Bandai Namco. Daniel Schwartzkopff (pictured right, with co-founder Frans Cronje) says four years on the company has seen it now turning a profit and no longer relying on \"burning VC funds\". The company has 18 employees and Schwartzkopff says their immediate plans include fleshing out its product offering for the conversational agent and expanding overseas sales, primarily in the US (the company already has a sales office in San Francisco). \"It is very cost effective for US businesses to utilise DataProphet as we have a major cost advantage by operating out of SA,\" he adds.  Founded in 2011 by Dayne and Ryan Falkenberg (pictured here) and Mark Pederson, the Stellenbosch-based company uses virtual advisors on artificial intelligence platforms to advise sales and technical consultants. The platform has been adopted by a wide number of large organisations in the banking, insurance, telecommunications, oil & gas, software and electronics sectors. These clients typically have large numbers of staff dealing with sales, service and operations. Clevva has since its inception been entirely self-funded by the company's co-founders and directors. At present the company has a team of seven. The startup has been recognised by a wide range of industry bodies, including being showcased by Gartner in 2015 as one of six African Innovations and selected by Microsoft to be part of its BizSpark programme. Clevva is looking to expand globally, starting with the UK and Australia and then heading to the US in the next 12 to 18 months.  Founded by Benji Meltzer and James Paterson (pictured left and right, respectively) in 2014, Cape Town based Aerobotics develops AI systems for drones. The company uses AI to assist farming consultants in South Africa, Australia and the UK to analyse processed maps and extract actionable information to identify problem areas in crops such as wheat, macadamia nuts, citrus and sugar cane. This enables the company to develop variable rate fertilisation application maps and predict the yield of crops. \"We have built technology that goes as far as identifying and classifying individual trees (using computer vision and machine learning) and then additional algorithms that track each of these trees, with a number of metrics per tree (health, biomass, canopy area, etc) over time,\" explains Meltzer. So far, the startup, which has 11 employees and has previously been selected for Startupbootcamp Insurtech accelerator programme in London, has used its own funds to finance operations, but signed a term sheet in March for its first round of funding. \"The tech is at a point now where we're ready to scale operations and we're looking to build partnerships with major players in industry. In the future we'd like to explore additional industries that would be interested in this data,\" says Meltzer.  Nigerian startup Kudi.ai has developed a chatbot which allows users to make payments and send money to friends and family in Nigeria via messaging. The company is a graduate of the YCombinator Winter 2017 batch. Pelumi Aboluwarin (pictured above, left with co-founder Yinka Adewale) says the founders began working on Kudi in July last year. \"We registered an entity two months after and ran a private beta in December 2016. We launched publicly in January 2017,\" says Aboluwarin. The company has seven employees. The company uses AI to understand user requests, drive conversations, understand user spending habits and prevent fraud. \"We developed it in-house using a variety of machine learning techniques,\" says Aboluwarin. The startup has put together a business-to-business solution too, which it is piloting with banks and telecommunication companies. \"After YCombinator we've raised additional seed funding from a group of angel investors in the valley and in Nigeria,\" says Aboluwarin.  Founded by former equity-derivatives specialist Annabel Dallamore (pictured here) together with Julian Dallamore and Mark Karimov in 2013, Johannesburg startup Stockshop.co.za offers a number of artificial intelligence solutions to financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. These include a conversational user interface (a bot in its infancy) that match-makes available financial consultants or brokers with client leads. The startup has also developed a bot interface that completes real-time identity verification checks on behalf of banks and financial institutions in line with requirements under the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA). The startup has also developed a solution that uses an algorithm that pairs financial behaviour, spending and other data along with emotional cues and provides clients with assistance around financial matters such as payments, administration, rewards, education, analytics and tracking. It's also launched a micro-insurance platform in April that is unique to the African market. In 2013 the company received support from the Seed Engine accelerator and has raised funding from two angel investors and a venture capital fund, for an undisclosed sum. It now has 11 employees.  Nigerian startup Aajoh uses artificial intelligence to help individuals that send a list of their symptoms via text, audio and photographs, to diagnose their medical condition. The business was started in February last year -- by Simi Adejumo (who is the CEO and pictured above), Zuby Onwuta, Vikas Ramachandra, Ike Ilochonwu and Charles Ademola -- with an angel investment of $10 000. The company has two companies and 35 users signed up for its pilot programme. \"Our present go-to-market strategy involves getting companies to sign up to the platform as part of staff health benefits,\" says Adejumo. Adejumo said the app won't replace medical diagnoses but will allow doctors to make the best use of their time by allowing them to focus on the patients that need physical care. \"In frontier markets, there's a high patient to doctor ratio with Nigeria having a 4000 to one patient-to-doctor ratio, in proper context on the average an individual spends about 20 minutes with a GP, so assuming the population fell ill (all) at once, it would take over 55 days to get care,\" he says. The company's immediate plans are to grow its pilot programme and then expand to India. \"By August we aim to have implemented partnerships with key pharmacies across Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria and increased our user base to 1000.\" Ventureburn focuses on startup news and technology trends in emerging markets.

      "content": "Over $300-billion of oil and gas exploration projects have been shelved since the oil price fell from a high of $120 in July 2014 to a low of $25 in early 2015 -- but three South Africans' use of a statistical algorithm promises to cut the cost of finding oil and gas. While unlisted UK company Africa New Energies (ANE) recently became the subject of a bidding war with valuations of hundreds of millions of dollars, analysts remain cautious, with the company yet to discover a single barrel of oil. The company, launched by Stephen Larkin, Brendon Raw and Shakes Motsilili in 2012, uses data collected from satellites, aircraft and ground-based earthquake detection monitors to scope for oil and gas. ANE is backed by both the UN and the Namibian government, which has awarded the company a  22 000 square kilometre concession - an area larger than Gauteng. It plans to start drilling in 2018. Zak Mir, the media pundit who hosts TipTV in London said ANE's algorithm was the first technology innovation with a realistic chance of success to emerge after the industry slump -- with many exploration techniques still overly reliant on seismic methods, which were introduced in 1924. \"While there is a bit of a dot com feel to these rumours, I have no doubt that interest in ANE's technology will reach fever-pitch if its drilling programme in the Kalahari does deliver.\" Andrew Turpin, a former head of media relations at energy companies Iberdrola and Centrica and Indian oil refining group Essar, said ANE's algorithm materially improves the notoriously low probability of finding land-based hydrocarbons through drilling expensive test wells. The algorithm can prove even more valuable, he said, in that it enables remote desktop assessment of hundreds of potential hydrocarbon deposits across entire continents, making it possible for investors to rank prospects before they have set foot in the country. This can eliminate the risk of wasting billions on infrastructure. \"In a world where oil majors are paying $17 to replace each barrel of reserves using their internal geological teams and investor sentiment is moving away from mega-hydrocarbon projects, ANE's algorithm is a potential game changer,\" said Turpin. \"However, there is still a risk for any bidder looking at ANE. Nothing is proven yet and most bidders would want clarity that the Kalahari acreage contains more than just fossilised sea water,\" he stressed. Edward Stock of Artaois, the London-based independent energy markets consultancy said \"the industry is facing a dilemma as to where new reserves will come from. This is a time where investment into high-cost exploration in hostile environments is waning and the current focus on fracking is seen as uneconomical at the current prices. \"Technology that will increase the efficiency of exploration while providing returns at current levels should be attracting investment back into the sector.\" But Stock agrees with Turpin's caution. \"Nothing is proven yet, and ANE's unorthodox funding model constrains the amount of capital it can raise.  The company claims a prospective resource of 1.6 billion barrels -- so -- at ANE's forecast of $40 per barrel -- the outcome of its drilling campaign is one that the rest of the industry will be watching closely.\" ANE's South African country manager Shakes Motsilili was tight-lipped when asked to comment on the bids, stating that if any discussions were happening they tended to be drawn out over many months and would be subject to confidentiality. ANE CEO Stephen Larkin will be hosted by Startup Grind Cape Town on 25th April to talk about the potential for crowdfunding to galvanise other South African tech startups. ",

      "content": "Global accelerator Startupbootcamp has announced the launch of its first African-based programme in Cape Town with the aim of accelerating 10 startups from September. The announcement was made yesterday. The three-month bootcamp, backed by BNP Paribas, the RCS Group and PwC, is open to startups that focus on a number of sectors. These include: blockchain, connected devices, payment solutions, asset management, ecommerce, alternative financing, identity management, data and behavioural analytics, digital connectivity, enabling technologies and integrated supply chains. Ten successful applicants selected for the programme will each be awarded EUREUR15,000. Selected participants will also receive free office space, convertible notes, access to funding as well as access to a network of partners and venture capital (VC) funds. Though there is no upfront cost for those startups that participate in the programme, the accelerator will take an eight percent equity stake in each participating businesses. The bootcamp will also bring together a network of mentors and experts from various industries -- including banking, insurance, consultancy, leasing and technology -- to help guide those startups chosen for the programme. Sam Ahmed, Startupbootcamp global public relations manager, said the programme would use a \"highly\" competitive application process. \"All applications are evaluated based on various criteria, however, having a team, a prototype, some sort of traction are all highly desirable. Naturally, they also have to be working on tech solutions,\" said Ahmed Those startups that qualify will be asked to present their ideas in a series of pitching days between May and July. Commenting on the Cape Town launch Startupbootcamp joint MD Philip Kiracofe said the African tech and digital landscape is growing exponentially. \"Cape Town is one of the most vibrant and creative hubs on the continent and we are both excited and humbled to contribute by attracting global expertise here.\" The Western Cape Minister of Economic Opportunities Alan Winde said Startupbootcamp's decision to launch its African programme in Cape Town demonstrated the business confidence the programme has in the Western Cape, adding that the region has emerged as a centre for venture capital activity in South Africa.   Startups that wish to apply for the programme must apply by 9 July and follow the application process.   Featured image: Startup Mena via Flickr  ",

      "content": "They may have secured R400 000 from two investors on SA TV show Shark Tank last year, but Jason Newmark and Chelsea Evans learnt a hard lesson when they recently lost R200 000 on tech developers. Speaking at a Fuckup Nights event held in Cape Town on Wednesday, Newmark and Evans, co-founders of wedding planning site Plan My Wedding, detailed how choosing the wrong website developers also set them back a year. The monthly event, in which entrepreneurs detail their biggest failures, was hosted by co-working space Cape Town Office at the Canterbury Club. \"We ended up spending R200k on developers we found out later on had no coding experience whatsoever. They had basically designed a template through WordPress...\" said Newmark. After the disappointment, Evans got a job and Newmark set up a side business to get by. The second developers the duo hired didn't share the vision and left a trail of errors on the back-end of their site. The two also spent cash on security upgrades after they discovered that these developers had tried to hack into the site more than 20 times. \"We went through background checks, but not knowing a thing about tech you think you've outsourced something to someone who knows what they are talking about,\" says Evans. She says the biggest mistake the two made was in hiring too quickly. \"With our third developers we gave them small projects and worked on the relationship slowly as opposed to give them one huge amount of coding work to do, before we knew they could accomplish the small steps,\" says Evans. She recommends entrepreneurs ask developers where they are learning from, what are their resources and what conferences they are attending, to ensure they make the grade.

      "content": "Nigerian entrepreneur Dayo Elegbe was feeling good. He'd worked with big names in the UK and his latest idea to give away a car on a Nigerian game show looked like a money spinner. Little did he know that he was one move away from losing thousands of dollars. \"I couldn't sleep for three years. I had crazy insomnia,\" says Elegbe, recalling his biggest failure in business, at a Fuckup Nights event held at the Canterbury Club in Cape Town last night. The monthly event, in which entrepreneurs detail their biggest failures, was hosted by co-working space Cape Town Office. Elegbe, founder of mobile digital marketing agency Sponge Africa, thought he knew it all, after nearly 15 years working in the advertising industry in the UK. Fresh in from the UK, he hit on an idea to run a television show using audience polls. He approached the concessionaire of the country's state lottery with the idea of getting funding for the project, while the concessionaire could use the show to run their own live lottery. \"I was so chummy with the chairman at the time, who is a billionaire, that he used to call me up and just say 'how are things going?',\" said Elegbe. The idea was to run an SMS poll to give way a Toyota Corolla every week. After a successful initial test, the poll went live. \"So we said, 'you know what, we're going to go out and we're going to launch this campaign', full blown. We'd bought all the cars, paid the expense of licenses and done everything. And I was so confident that I felt nothing could go wrong. Until it did...\" On the first day of the campaign he called one of the developers, who told him 100 000 people had already taken part. \"And at this point I was counting the money already, so I was like take a scene from Hangover 3. I was out with my mates, we were popping bottles, we were like 'I am going to make so much money' it's quite ridiculous.\" The next morning after a long night of partying, he got back to the office. \"I get back into the office and he (the developer) said he made a mistake... he said actually it's not 100 000, it's less than a thousand. At this point I had been on the phone to the chairman saying 'we're fucking hammering it', and he'd transferred all the money to the game show like that, straight away.\" He began wondering what could have gone wrong. \"It was simple. In my pride I just didn't do enough research.\" MTN had been giving away a house. \"So my promotion went head to head with someone giving away a house.\" He then held an emergency meeting with the chairman where he explained the problem. \"I really should've said 'just kill me now', but instead I said we'll turn this around and we will make your money back.\" The poll began picking up, from under 1000 respondents a day, it climbed to under 4000. \"And then the government decides to ban all lotteries. It was like a film... and then we literally had to stop.\" Elegbe says for three years it was \"like living a nightmare\" as he tried to pay back the debt he had accumulated. \"It dented my confidence for a long time.\" The experience he says taught him an important lesson of restraint and humility. \"I had close to 15 years of digital experience, I've run these campaigns. One of the first mobile campaigns in the UK. And yet I didn't know shit, when the biggest operator on the freaking African continent (MTN) decides to come up against you.\" Failure however is ever present in business, he says. \"You don't stop fucking up, you just get better at spotting things,\" he adds. But he said things are now turning around. \"About two months ago the chairman calls. At this point we'd gone quite far in developing the concept of a TV show. He calls me up and says 'I hear you're doing quite well with the TV show. When am I going to see the pilot so I can flight it?\" Featured image: Dayo Elegbe, founder Sponge Africa (David Peter Harris) Ventureburn focuses on startup news and technology trends in emerging markets.

      "content": "The Union Bank of Nigeria has partnered with the Co-Creation Hub (CcHub) to launch the Centenary Innovation Challenge with entries closing 19 May. It comes as the Union Bank celebrates its 100th anniversary with the theme \"Celebrate, Impact and Lead\". The bank aims to find innovative startups and offer them support to address the country's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The challenge is open to university students, software developers, entrepreneurs and academics from Nigeria. The Union Bank CEO Emeka Emuwa recently addressed the partnership at a press conference held last week. In his address Emuwa said the bank is committed to being at the leading edge of innovation, with emphasis on enhancing customer experience and driving social innovation. He said the bank was moved to partner with CcHub as it believed that by working together private institutions and individuals can tackle social problems in a sustainable way. The head of the Union Bank's group corporate strategy, Lola Cardoso, also spoke on how dedicated the bank is to being a \"socially driven and responsible bank\". \"Our approach to corporate citizenship helps us leverage on our heritage as a strong financial institution to support local efforts aimed at achieving sustainable development and driving social change.\" \"For the past two years, our approach to corporate social responsibility has focused on three strategic pillars - financial inclusion, agriculture and talent development,\" she said. \"This competition, our Centenary Innovation Challenge, focuses on addressing the SDGs while also aligned with the three strategic pillars we have identified as a bank. Specifically, we are focusing on agriculture, education and financial inclusion for the Challenge - these are areas we are committed to creating significant impact and establishing our leadership,\" she said. CEO and co-founder of the CcHub Bosun Tijani said the partnership would provide CcHub with a platform to implement its solutions for communities and the country as a whole. \"Over 98% of the support, we get as a hub is derived from outside Nigeria and this relationship with Union Bank is our first with a Nigerian financial institution. Clearly, this is a commitment we appreciate and we want other reputable institutions to emulate,\" concluded Tijani. Featured image: Jeff Attaway via Flickr (CC 2.0, resize) ",

      "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Nigeria's ban on equity crowdfunding \"is seriously slowing down\" the introduction of crowdfunding in the country, says a new report. The Crowdfunding Potential for Nigeria report released last month by the Crowdfunding Hub, says crowdfunding has significant potential in the country, but that the SEC's ban issued in August last year has stifled the setting up of crowdfunding platforms. The SEC believes that crowdfunding cannot be effective in Nigeria for now because of a lack of rules. Donation and reward-based crowdfunding are however excluded from the SEC's regulatory remit. This is despite a fast-evolving banking system which provides a promising infrastructure for crowdfunding in Nigeria, as well as a burgeoning entrepreneurial scene and a fast-growing population of 179 million. \"To move forward, donation and reward-based crowdfunding should be fostered as a first step towards crowdfund investing,\" says the report's author Suzanne Wisse-Huiskes of MatchBox Consultancy. Wisse-Huiskes, who lived and worked in Nigeria between 2014 and 2016, consulted with over 30 policy makers, NGOs, investors, and entrepreneurs in compiling the report. She pointed out in the report that these types of crowdfunding have successfully paved the way for equity crowdfunding in other regions. The report says the African continent accounted for about $83.2-million in crowdfunding in 2015, with Nigeria accounting for between seven and eight million dollars of this. At the start of this year Nigeria had one equity based platform, Malaik, launched in 2015. The landing page on its website asks those interested to leave their details to join a waiting list for the relaunch of the site. In addition as the beginning of this year Nigeria had three donations-based platforms, namely: Donate-ng.com, Naturad and Imeela. The report notes that the lack of patent laws is another concern. It discourages entrepreneurs to share their business ideas online. Wisse-Huiskes told Ventureburn that \"to my knowledge, peer-to-peer lending platforms are also illegal\". \"The legal provisions of crowdfunding are a big challenge to the organisation (SEC). However, they are looking for ways to go about it so that companies will enjoy the benefits of crowdfunding in the country as well,\" says Wisse-Huiskes, who adds that the SEC is looking at the crowdfunding rules in US and Canada in order to ensure an enabling legal and regulatory framework. She said equity crowdfunding could prove to be an expedient way for many struggling entrepreneurs to raise capital, since they are considered as high risk to banks. Derin Fagbure, a director of donations-based platform FundMyP, agreed, saying crowdfunding can help thousands of Nigerian business owners to access finance. She said business owners often battle to obtain finance from banks which are reluctant to advance small loans which they view as more likely to be defaulted upon. Those that approach the government for funding often have to battle bureaucratic procedures, she added. However Fagbure said scams on donation-based platforms are common, meaning crowdfunding platforms often have to battle to win the trust of the public by making them more aware of what crowdfunding platforms do. Attempts to get comment from the Securities and Exchange Commission by time of publication proved unsuccessful. \"GET MONIE\" get-rich-quick mentality is pervasive throughout Nigeria. Just look at how many Nigerians both believed in, gleefully embraced and then, fell victim to, the recent 'pyramid-selling' MMM Ponzi scheme. Even large tranches of university students naively gambled away their entire semester school fees on that '419' scam. Nigeria is far from ready for sophisticated trust and belief funding arrangements such as crowd funding. Nigeria'a artful 419'ers would immediately sswoop upon crowd funding as a 'Candy Store' playing field. The result would be a list as long as your leg (longer than your arm) of undelivered, dissappeared projects. It would be a veritable bloodbath of gullible scammed investors. The SEC, right now, recognises the state of the nation and is acting kind of like the Ministry Of Health, in giving early Financial Health education to the populace - whist setting out an immunisation and disease-control structure for what has been, for a very long time, a peculiarly-Nigerian pandemic scourge of Economic and Financial Criminology.

The 12-week programme aims to accelerate startups within the early and growth stages by providing them with insights and exposure to top financial institution executives. Selected participants will have the opportunity to develop and test their products and solutions in collaboration with senior financial representatives. These include representatives from the DIFC Authority, Accenture, Citi, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Visa, Emirates NBD, and Mashreq. \"The FinTech Hive at DIFC will connect innovators in financial services technology with the banks, financial institutions and service providers within our dynamic ecosystem at DIFC,\" DIFC Authority CEO Arif Amiri said in a press release. Amiri said the programme is aligned with the UAE National Innovation Strategy and Dubai Plan 2021, which aims to position Dubai as one of the smartest cities in the world. The programme provides selected participants with access to mentorship from partnerships such as Facebook and Envestnet. \"Emerging technologies are playing a pivotal role in the transformation of financial services.

      "content": "Fintech startups in the Middle East and North Africa have raised $100-million over the last decade, yet 28% fail in their initial years, says a new report by business support organisation Wamda and online payment gateway Payfort. Released last month the report, titled State of Fintech: Unbundling the financial service sector in MENA, estimates that about $50-million in investments are expected to go to fintech startups in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region this year. The region was home to 105 fintech startups by the end of 2015 (see featured image), with half of these having been launched since 2012. In all 30 firms are situated in North Africa. The UAE leads with 30 fintech startups, followed by Egypt with 17 and Jordan and Lebanon with 15 each. Just 10% of fintech startups in the region account for 43% of investments and employ 55% of the 1600 employees in the sector. The average fintech entrepreneur is a male university graduate in his late 20s or early 30s, with experience abroad. While the report reveals that the biggest challenge faced by fintech startups is dealing with financial regulations, fintech startups in the region must still overcome trust, a lack of understanding among the banked population and a preference by those residing there for cash over other forms of payment. However the report said a number of reforms and new regulations point to increased awareness on a policymaker level. These include new mobile money regulations in Egypt and a special jurisdiction in the UAE (called a fintech sandbox) to allow fintech startups to test their ideas without having to comply with all regulatory bodies. \"Any structure to test ideas away from the regulatory eye would be great, but it's not regulations that are stopping startups. What is truly lacking are support mechanisms - look how the UK is encouraging entrepreneurs through coworking spaces, grants, tax breaks and much more,\" commented Willie Elamien of Egypt's Flat6Labs, in the report. The report noted that just one in four fintech startups in the region receive support from accelerators. Despite the challenges the report said fintech startups, particularly peer-to-peer platforms, can play an important part in increasing lending to SMEs, which make up over 80% of firms in the region yet account for just 8% of credit lending by Arab banks across the region. The report says if Egypt had the startup density (fintech per million inhabitants) of the UAE, it would host 350 fintech startups. It recommends that the country capitalise on fintech accelerators to convert parts of the informal economy into a cashless formal economy with access to financial services. Two fintech accelerators were added in 2016 -- the 1864 Accelerator and AUC Venture Lab FinTech Accelerator both in Cairo. For Tunisia and Morocco the report says policymakers there should incentivise startups to build on top of the national payment system, while removing monopolies and encouraging competition and corporate startup collaboration.

      "content": "The number of startups spun out of SA science councils and universities climbed from 29 to 45 between 2008 and 2014, following the implementation of a new IP law in 2009, a report released this week revealed. The SA National Survey of Intellectual Property (IP) and Technology Transfer at Publicly Funded Research Institutions, which was released yesterday by the Department of Science and Technology, noted that some progress had been made since the Intellectual Property Rights from Publicly Financed Research and Development (IPR) Act came into effect in 2009. The act aims to get publicly-funded research institutions such as universities and science councils to commercialise IP. However Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor told a media briefing yesterday that though the increase in startups founded from publicly-funded IP was a positive trend, it was dwarfed by the 1400 startups that have emerged from the town of Cambridge, Massachusetts alone where the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University are based. In a briefing note released yesterday Pandor said 73% of the 45 startups that have been set up to commercialise the institutions' technology were based on publicly funded IP (The featured image above shows the number of startups operational at the end of each respective year). Pandor noted that the number of filed patents, trademarks and registered designs increased more rapidly than the increase in research expenditure. \"This is clearly good news. Between 2011 and 2014, on average 100 new technologies were added annually to the portfolio managed by universities and science councils,\" she said. She said there had also been a quadrupling in the actual number of licences executed per year in the period -- from seven to 28. More than 88% of this revenue accrued consistently each year to the same four institutions that have well-established technology transfer units, she said, adding that the majority of IP transactions yielded less than R100 000 per year. Dr Glenda Kruss, the deputy executive director for the Human Science Research Council 's Centre for Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators, said technology transfer units need to be better resourced if SA is to vamp up the number of university and science council spinoffs. \"The system is very small and under-capacitated,\" said Kruss, pointing out that at present there are only about 100 staff technology transfer centres at universities and science councils. Many of the centres need more staff in legal, marketing and administrative areas, she added.

      "content": "South Africa's Financial Services Board (FSB) has set a date of 30 June by which it plans to rule on whether to craft specific rules or not for equity crowdfunding, an FSB spokesman said this week. This follows the completion of a research report by the FSB on crowdfunding. FSB internal communications coordinator Thandolwethu Masango told Ventureburn however that the report on the FSB's research would not be made public. \"The research was meant to assist the FSB to get insight into how other jurisdictions are supervising crowdfunding activities and which piece of legislation would be applicable in governing the said activities in South Africa,\" said Masango. The FSB is seeking to communicate its position to the industry by 30 June on whether to craft regulations or not for crowdfunding, he said. The African Crowdfunding Association has been calling for the FSB to craft a specific regulatory framework on crowdfunding. African Crowdfunding Association chair Kevin Allen said the June 30 date was news to him, but added that it was encouraging if clarity on any regulatory framework would be made public soon. \"It's not that it (equity crowdfunding) is illegal - it's just that there's no clarity,\" he said. Meanwhile donations-based crowdfunding platform Thundafund is looking to pilot an equity crowdfunding platform. Thundafund chief executive Patrick Schofield said he was not waiting for any regulatory certainty from the FSB and was going ahead with setting up a platform to facilitate equity crowdfunding in South Africa. His idea is to use venture capital funds to vet deals and provide a certain percentage of the total equity injection, before placing these on the platform to attract investors. Schofield said he was in talks with one investor to bankroll the platform, but said he was also considering using crowdfunding to fund the costs of the developing the platform. Meanwhile a new lending threshold which came into effect in November under the National Credit Regulations is also likely to limit the ability of peer-to-peer lending platforms to fund startups. It will mean that investors who use peer-to-peer lending platforms and who lend to any business with an annual turnover of below R1m will have to register as a credit provider with the National Credit Regulator (NCR). A number of countries have regulations on equity crowdfunding, including the US and the UK as well as a number of countries, mainly developed nations. Last month Australia's senate approved new equity crowdfunding laws. In December Brazil's securities exchange commission put out a request for input from the public for equity crowdfunding, while in the same month Chilean authorities authorised the setting up of working groups to look into regulating equity crowdfunding. Thailand and Malaysia released equity crowdfunding regulations in 2015. Featured image: Investment Zen via Flickr (CC 2.0, resized) I really hope that the FSB adopts the 'right' light-handed approach for equity crowdfunding in June . I got involved in crowdfunding in New Zealand about 6 years ago and the Kiwi model, along with the UK model,  are the best and most successful in the world (worth looking at for anyone wanting to lobby. Why? Because they are the most 'hands off\" with fewer investor restrictions. I lived and worked in SA for many years and if there is one thing that all African entrepreneurs need, it 'alternative' access to capital employing the power, support and reach of their  respective 'crowds'. gary.mersham@openpolytechnic.ac.nz Ventureburn focuses on startup news and technology trends in emerging markets.

      "content": "Ventureburn and Splash conducted an interview with The Foschini Group's (TFG) CIO, Brent Curry, which revealed many insights into what TFG and startups are producing. It's also particularly important to note his insights as they might be a way for entrepreneurs to bring their product to a large market. To date, TFG has partnered with tech startups such as Wumdrop and Pargo which brought about TFG's Deliver 2 Me service while also allowing customers to choose a convenient collection point for their items. \"We know that exceptional tech talent usually prefers working in the edgier startup space, rather than at a big corporate where their freedom and creativity is more likely to be stifled. So working with startups enables us to access that very scarce talent,\" said Curry. \"We are always focused on working with black-owned businesses as part of our enterprise development programme,\" he continued. He also went on to explain how startups' pricing in regards to their solution is attractive to big corporations such as TFG. Startups are also able to add new functionalities quicker compared to larger organisations. \"We also explore opportunities with startups in the tech space, because they have innovative ideas and are fired up by their product or service. Often they are not market-ready, but their entrepreneurial spirit means they are open to Intellectual Property input from TFG to transform their concept into a real-world solution,\" said Curry. Working in the startup sector means you're probably more than likely to hear about the risks of working with big corporations. Which is why it's refreshing to hear another perspective, that is, the risks big corporations face when dealing with startups. \"We have no challenges per se, however being a big corporate we have a lot of governance and have to fill out all the right forms, but startups don't want to work this way. So we drop some of these requirements, to ensure we get products out quicker as solutions,\" said Curry. Read more: Banking on ecommerce growth in SA -- Q&A with The Foschini Group's Brent Curry He adds that working with startups is somewhat of a calculated risk for big corporations. But TFG mitigates those risks by working closely with the startups during the development process. The partnership between TFG and tech startups is that of a symbiotic one. Curry mentioned that in certain cases the company would bring startups on site, providing them with office space. In return, the accompanied startups would provide TFG with their services. TFG would also offer IP to partnering startups. \"Startups are not always business ready, but we understand how the business works and can identify the value proposition,\" said Curry. The corporation not only provides startups with IP but also coaching and strategic input on how to price any products and services as well as how to commercialise any concepts. \"In many cases, we've even directed them to venture capitals and funding companies to grow their business,\" said Curry. He elaborated on this aspect, using Wigroup as an example. TFG's investing network helped Wigroup grow into a medium-sized business, according to Curry. Some might think that corporates steer clear of accelerators and tech hubs, but most C-level executives keep a close ear to the ground regarding startups. Read more: 10 defining moments that shaped the 2016 SA startup ecosystem \"A friend chairs the Young Entrepreneur Organisation and will encourage me to meet with potential partners in the tech sector,\" said Curry. C-level executives such as Curry also attend international and local tech conferences to find innovative startups. During a recent trip to Mobile World Congress held in Barcelona, Curry managed to find attractive startups. \"We made many connections and we will be trialling some of those potential solutions, as they are looking to partner with companies like TFG to take their product to market,\" he said. TFG also hosts a DevFest in the IT sector. The corporate would pose a problem which the developers would try and solve. The company then awards a monetary prize for the team with the best solution. Curry went on to say that the DevFest is open to both internal staff as well as outside participants. The partnership programme is currently undergoing changes, with more effort being put into TFG's ecommerce site. The corporation is also looking into including mobile wallets for customers, said Curry. His final thoughts drifted toward Cape Town being a key player in Africa's startup scene. \"Cape Town is a great incubator for startups because the universities and other training institutions put out really good talent. Cape Town is also home to a number of large corporations, with the retail sector primarily based in the city so you don't need to move to Johannesburg to work in this space. \" ",

      "content": "It's a scenario that has played out in many a boardroom around the world. An entrepreneur lands a sizeable investment but has not spent a single cent on protecting their intellectual property (IP). No matter what your exit strategy, or whether you even have one, the protection of IP and an appropriate IP strategy should be conscious, pro-active discussions that all startups have at a very early stage. One effective way of protecting new technology is by way of a patent. While not all technologies are patentable, the rumour that inventions that rely on software for their operation cannot be patented is the stuff of fables. If you are not considering patents for your software-driven business you may quite simply be missing the boat. But patents are not only effective in preventing others from making, using or selling your patented technology. In fact, the following may be far more beneficial to your software startup: Investors like patents. They clearly indicate ownership of IP, meaning that it is evident to potential investors what technology your startup actually owns. Patents are easily identifiable and demonstrate some degree of differentiation from the status quo -- they can also be indicators of innovation. A patent, unlike know-how, is something that remains behind when a key-man leaves, meaning that investors get to invest in something more tangible than talent. Patents also give potential investors at least some level of comfort that the technology they are investing in could be monopolised. You also do not have to break the bank to get patent protection. One pending or provisional patent application with some outstanding international patent rights may be all you need to satisfy the investors. Patents can be used to protect your startup against claims of patent infringement from others. Having its own patents on hand would naturally strengthen your startup's position at the negotiating table and, when faced with an allegation of patent infringement, cross-licensing or counter-suing are options which may encourage the patent assertor to back down. This is particularly relevant for startups planning on launching in the US, a market well known for its assertive patentees and less savoury operators like patent trolls. In his book Cash in, cash out, Fundamo founder Hannes van Rensberg mentions their defensive IP strategy: Fundamo \"lodged many patents and managed (their) patent portfolio actively, not so that they could sue for royalties, but to assure their clients that what they licensed from (Fundamo) was actually (theirs)\". Patented technology can be licensed. This is particularly beneficial for technology which no longer aligns with a startup's direction. As big-league examples, IBM has been reported to generate about US$1-billion in revenue every year through out-licensing their own patents and other intellectual property and in its heyday Microsoft was making about US$2-billion by licensing patents used in Android-based phones. Even if you have no intention of suing, others (without knowing this) will think twice about encroaching once aware of your patents. In some cases a simple letter is effective in deterring or just delaying would-be competitors from eating your lunch. Patents play an important role in protecting innovative and technical advances in the software realm and should not be left at the very bottom of your to-do list. Stephen Middleton and Erik van der Vyver are patent attorneys at Von Seidels.

Applicants have until 15 April to apply. The FSAT Labs has served as an incubator and accelerator for both SA and French entrepreneurs, placing a strong emphasis on black entrepreneurs. FSAT Lab COO Alexia Vettier told Ventureburn that the French government is helping the FSAT Labs through the French embassy as well as the French tech network. \"Indeed, Cape Town has become a French tech hub since 2016 thanks to Methys, a French private company, that has also invested in the incubator,\" said Vettier. Half the investment had been committed by the Small Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA) with the other half being invested by French agency Methys. \"The incubation phase of 6 months is totally free for the Startups. We will provide them with a wide range of services: digital services, coaching, mentoring, an access to experts who will support them in different fields either through workshops, or through individual meetings to help them on their specific issue, and also the startups have free access to a co-working space in our premises in Century City,\" said Vettier. Following the completion of incubation FSAT Lab will then dedicate a further 24 months, helping the participating startups mature. During the acceleration phase the team at FSAT Labs will look to help participants to bring their product to market and to get access to venture capital funds and investors. \"During this phase, all the services provided will be chargeable. The startups will be also supported in their fundraising process and the FSAT Labs will take a percentage of the transaction value,\" said Vettier.

      "content": "The Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) has concluded an agreement with an SA startup that plans to launch the country's first production-based 3D metal printer by June. The investment of R17-million in Metal Heart, approved last month, is the 11th deal concluded by the IDC's new industries unit, since the unit's launch in 2015. Six of the deals have been in new companies. \"They moved quickly,\" says Gert Lombard, who says he and business partner Kim Gray initially met with the unit in November last year. The deal was approved two weeks ago. The investment is in the form of a term loan and a minority equity stake in the firm. The company has yet to begin operating, but has secured a deal with a large tooling and injection mould company in Gauteng which manufactures most of the SA-produced metal tools sold in local hardware stores. Lombard said the cost to produce fabricated metal items by 3D printer will be higher than those produced in traditional dye caste mouldings, but it will cut the time spent manufacturing the metal by about half. In addition the manufacturer won't have to invest in new capital investment, which could have cost over R20-million. The IDC's new business unit aims to help set up new strategic sectors which have the ability to create jobs and in which South Africa has a competitive advantage in. It focuses on eight priority industries, namely: gas beneficiation, energy storage, fuel cells, medical devices, natural products, renewable inputs, additive manufacturing and nanotech. Christo Fourie, head of the IDC's new industries business unit, said his unit has approved funding of R107.1-million since its inception, of which R63.4-million is in six new companies (including five startups) and R43.7-million is in four existing companies. In all, the funding consists of R26.4-million in startup equity, R20.4-million in growth equity, R6-million in term loans, R50-million in revolving credit facilities (to fund execution of orders) and R4.3-million in project expenditure. Of the investments made in new companies, one investment each has been in energy storage, additive manufacturing and water, while three have been in nanotech. Though water does not form part of the unit's focus areas, Fourie said the investment was made as part of the funder's industrial infrastructure business unit by agreement between the two units. All six new companies are based in Gauteng. Three are youth-owned and managed and three are black-owned and managed. Each company has multiple founding shareholders with backgrounds ranging from engineering and law to the financial sector. Fourie said in a 2015 interview with the government's Public Sector Manager magazine, that the unit planned to invest about R900-million to R1-billion over five years. He admitted that the unit got off to a slower than expected start, but pointed out that the unit aims to do over R220-million approval in the current financial year, with the aim of increasing this to R470-million a year by 2020. The idea of the unit is to work towards setting up whole industries. Fourie said good progress has been made so far, particularly in priority industries, namely energy storage, fuel cells and gas beneficiation. He said industry development steering committees have been set up in the energy storage and fuel cells sectors. The committees have representation from all relevant industry stakeholders from both the public and private sector. \"Sub-working committees have also been established and these groups are busy executing various work packages,\" he added. However he said the changing economic environment poses the biggest challenge, specifically the assumptions around the future sources of, demand for and price of energy. He said the unit is actively looking for entrepreneurs and is busy engaging its various networks such as universities, the Technology Innovation Agency and other science and research agencies. To qualify for funding, Fourie said the business has to fit into one of the unit's eight focus areas. He said the unit has received about 50 deals but added that not all of these will mature into formal applications for funding. At least 20 of these have been rejected.

      "content": "Facebook-owned WhatsApp's recent move into digital payments in India reinforces the view of many, that the biggest competition to existing legacy banks could well come from the so-called GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple). It is undeniable that the pace of disruption to legacy banking and financial services models will continue to accelerate. In addition, the pressure from challenger banks and fintech disrupters will drive the speed and the timeline of exiting financial services business model evolution. This is unlikely to be a comfortable time for the incumbent players. Adding to the pressure and complexity for the executive team of any bank or financial services business, is the rigid regulatory environment and the difficulty of adopting disruptive innovation whilst mitigating compliance risk. It is therefore ironic that the latest technology is creating disruption while at the same time serving as a tool to mitigate and reduce regulatory risk. We have, as part of our fintech cluster at The Cape Innovation & Technology Initiative (CiTi) been seeking out a way to support and assist executives to better understand the regulatory risks inherent in fintech innovation and how to manage them (and also how to use RegTech to their advantage). We are very pleased to announce that we have procured one of the foremost experts in Europe, on this subject, Patrick Butler, who will be in South Africa on the 24th and 25th April in Johannesburg. Patrick is the Senior Regulatory Risk Expert at FINTECH Circle. He is a hands on-transformation expert and thought leader in Regulatory Risk management. Amongst Patrick's many achievements, he transformed and rebuilt Corporate and Business Banking Compliance for Barclays. He was also Head of Investment and Corporate Banking Compliance at Bank of America Merrill Lynch for Europe, Middle East and Africa. Patrick also redesigned and relaunched Global Compliance Career Academy at Barclays Bank to rebalance technical training, contextual knowledge and behavioural skills in partnership with Cambridge Judge Business School. Behavioural components of Risk Management are well understood.  Patrick conducts culture coaching for senior management, risk professionals and trading staff at global banks and outsource providers. As an attendee, you have the opportunity to get help and advice from Patrick and to hear about fintech compliance, particularly: As well as Conduct, Risk, Behavioural Economics, Customer Bias & RegTech Patrick will be on hand to answer your questions and also to give you guidance and advice in a small Masterclass. This is an extract from a paper which Patrick recently delivered where he dealt with the loss of public trust in banking. In response, regulators have changed their focus from control design to outcomes. They focus on behaviour and culture, conduct, and individual accountability, while expanding enforcement. \"What has become clear is that individual behaviour (or conduct) underpinned headline events that have driven these new rules, such as LIBOR-fixing, PPI mis-selling and Foreign Exchange price manipulation. These enforcement actions resulted in immense damage to the reputation of the industry that ensures the facilitation of global trade and supports local, national and global economies and forced banks to spend billions in legal costs, customer remediation, strengthening their risk control frameworks and restructuring - not to mention the record-breaking fines that continue to be levied. In an industry under enormous pressure to provide returns, the billions in costs damaged key performance and liquidity measures such as Return on Capital and Tier 1 ratios. This in turn exacerbated the drive to deliver shareholder returns that are the basis for much of the decision making that will have contributed to the misconduct.  In a low-interest rate environment, fees have become even more critical, while the client base has greater ability to move due to technology and with less loyalty due to the loss of trust. Competition has become harsh in this self-perpetuating circle that squeezes the industry. So where does fintech fit? Where rewards continue to be huge, these large and sophisticated institutions have been adept at finding alternatives. Millions are spent on systems to monitor or control the sale, settlement and implementation and reporting of retail and wholesale products. In this environment, all firms - whether Wealth, Asset Management, Investment, Corporate or Retail banking and to a greater or lesser degree - have turned to technological and product innovation to create a competitive offering, by making their product better, faster or easier, to reduce costs to provide confidence in controls to manage the Regulatory burden. However, these innovators, challengers and incumbents must address the additional risk that this disruptive innovation creates. Meanwhile, the fintech firms have the advantage of fresh platforms, no highly public reputation (yet) to worry about and the opportunity to experiment and develop advanced brilliant new ideas to take advantage of the hyper leaps in technology.\" Come and join us at a fintech Masterclass in Johannesburg on the 24th and 25th April to better equip yourself for fintech decision making and engage with our team of international experts who can advise you on international best practice and provide you with practical advice regarding your fintech stress points. Book your spot here The FinTech Academy Africa. The Academy is aimed at C-Level executives who have limited time but who need a deep dive into global best practice in fintech. The two day curriculum has therefore been designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of key areas of fintech which would normally take between nine months and a year to attain in normal working circumstances.

      "content": "The SA government has no immediate plans to match the R1.5-billion that 48 large companies have committed to the SA SME Fund, National Treasury Director-General Lungisa Fuzile told Ventureburn today. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa pledged during the launch of the fund in May last year that the government would match any contribution made by the private sector. However Fuzile, who sits on the fund's board, said the government will instead look to improve coordination between the state and private sector, while stepping up its existing funding and business support to small businesses. \"It is not clear from a fiscal point of view that the immediate need is to add money,\" he explained. He stressed that the government's decision not to invest at present in the fund had nothing to do with concern over whether the fund would prioritise investing in black entrepreneurs or not. While the fund's interim CEO Lisa Klein said in September last year that the fund aimed to deploy the first monies in the first quarter of 2017, the fund has not accredited any fund managers yet. SA SME Fund CEO Quinton Dicks, who was appointed in January, said the fund aims to begin accrediting fund managers from June, when his team is expected to begin work. Dicks, who has 15 years' experience in the private equity sector, said the board had given him the go ahead a few weeks ago to begin recruiting a team. He intends to initially put together a team of five who will begin work on 1 June. The fund will invest in funds which will then invest in high-growth small and medium-sized enterprises. Dicks said the deployment of funds would be dependent on deal flow from accredited funds. Some are expected to have a closing this year, he said. While funding criteria is expected to be finalised only by June, he said the minimum contribution from funds themselves will be determined by the SA SME Fund and will depend on how each fund plans to deploy the monies. However he stressed that the the SME fund itself won't interfere in how funds choose to source their investments. In June last year the fund's chairman, Adrian Gore, said the fund will forgo part of its share of the fund management fees and pass this on to fund managers as an incentive for them to finance black entrepreneurs. Responding to a question on whether there will be any additional criteria to incentivise investment in black entrepreneurs, Dicks stressed the commercial intent of the fund. \"At the end of the day this is a commercial fund and the imperative is growth and if any entrepreneur reflects the attributes that will deliver growth these companies will be invested in,\" he said. While he admitted that the R1.5-billion in commitments was not a lot if one compared this to the annual amount spent by companies on enterprise development, it was still a sizeable amount when compared to what any agency disburses annually to SMEs. He said the fund will focus on SMEs and what he describes as \"midcaps\" (medium-sized firms) that are already profitable and had demonstrated the ability to scale. \"I don't think the focus of the fund is (on) startups,\" he added. \"We're trying to leverage money as quickly as we can so therefore the focus is on those that can already scale,\" he explained. While many may initially have been led to believe that the fund would help grow the country's nascent venture capital (VC) sector, he said the fund had not been set up to support the VC sector, but to rather to support existing scalable businesses to grow further. The fund would initially not focus on 12J venture-capital companies as the tax incentive has certain anomalies that don't make it investor friendly, he said. Apart from Gore and Fuzile, the board is made up of Brian Joffe, Jabu Mabuza, Christo Wiese, Dolly Mokgatle, Judy Dlamini, Nigel Payne and the Public Investment Corporation's Dan Matjila.

      "content": "Barclays Africa Group and Techstars today released the names of 10 financial-technology (fintech) companies selected to participate in the second Barclays Accelerator programme, powered by Techstars.

      "content": "SA banks and lenders may soon be able to use a finance-matching platform to source entrepreneurs looking for finance, if a new initiative piloted by SA fintech startup finfind proves successful. Launched in October 2015, finfind is piloting a number of new initiatives which will help entrepreneurs to get better access to finance in South Africa. Speaking to Ventureburn today, finfind CEO Darlene Menzies says these include an initiative which will allow banks and other lenders to source fundable entrepreneurs from the platform. Currently entrepreneurs that access the site can complete a questionnaire and be told whether they qualify for funding or not and are then referred to one of 328 financial products currently listed on the platform. These include everything from grants to debt finance, equity, invoice factoring and asset finance. SA startups looking for finance can tap at least 50 funds. Until now the onus has been on entrepreneurs themselves to pursue those lenders the platform picks out. But Menzies says the new initiative, which the startup began piloting in February, will go a step further by providing financiers with matched leads of these fundable businesses. The pilot is being funded by the Business Leadership SA and the Banking Association of SA. Menzies says the initiative will also help provide banks and other financiers with valuable data on what kind of entrepreneurs are seeking finance, what finance they are after and what their challenges are with getting finance. Such data can help lenders to adjust their lending criteria to meet client's needs. She says following the hearings held last month in Parliament on transformation in the financial sector, two banks got in contact with finfind to ascertain how they might be able to work with the platform. Nedbank is now testing a model where it pays a commission fee for every lead generated by finfind that results in the bank issuing a loan to an entrepreneur. The Small Enterprise Finance Agency (Sefa) is also using the platform to source leads but these are not commissioned based, says Menzies. Finfind is also looking to offer vouchers to entrepreneurs to fund accounting and business support from consultants. At present entrepreneurs must cover the cost of business support themselves from those accountants and consultants listed on the platform. Menzies says since its launch finfind has received 56,000 users, two thirds of whom are based in Gauteng. The remainder are mostly based in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Each user spends an average of about six minutes on the platform. The percentage of visitors that access the platform is split evenly between those that enter the platform through mobile devices and laptop or PCs. In all 5600 of all visitors so far to the platform have completed the form requesting finance. Just less than half of these, or 2500, had the necessary collateral or documentation such as financials or a business plan in place to be eligible for finance from financiers. Users that complete the questionnaire for finance are obliged to supply details such as their ID number and company registration number if they have a registered business. Menzies says this is to ensure that financiers are able to receive as many legitimate clients as possible. In all three quarters of those that have completed the questionnaire for finance are involved in a business with an annual turnover of under R1-million. Menzies stressed that the figure has been skewed in that applicants have mainly come through the Small Enterprise Development Agency (Seda) with which finfind is partnering. The majority of Seda clients are micro enterprises. Finfind received venture capital funding late last year from Kingston Capital. Menzies however said she could not disclose the amount of funding. Added to this the Department of Small Business Development is providing annual funding of R2.2-million to finfind. Menzies says the department is able to use the platform to tap valuable data on who is looking for finance and what their challenges are.

Much more than just money, it gives me access to a community of like-minded entrepreneurs with whom I hope I will collaborate to create a bigger impact worldwide.\" Out of the 12 startups that pitched at the finals, three were from Africa: Raye7 from Egypt Jamii /EdgePoint Digital Ltd from Tanzania and Kasha from Rwanda.

      "content": "A Cape Town startup is looking to change the way customers buy and sell cars on the internet, by using machine learning and what it says is a unique payment model. The startup launched its platform last month after trading for six months to gain proof of concept. Get\\Worth co-founder Mark Ridgway - a former CEO of TransUnion Receivables - says the company was able to conclude about R20-million in deals through the platform in March. The startup's model is different from other online car dealers such as CarZAR.co.za and WeBuyCars.co.za. When get\\Worth takes ownership of the car, the seller is able to get immediate cash in hand, just like most other online car dealerships. However, get\\Worth claims their model is unique as the seller is then also able to get a further payment based on the difference in the trade and retail price that the dealer is able to conclude after subtracting its fees. \"We are offering more than cash, we are offering value too,\" says Ridgway. \"We think this is almost first world. We've researched it. No one is providing a product to the seller (like this).\" The company charges buyers' fees that are calculated as R7500 on each sale plus 1% of the retail price as well as a financing fee. After refurbishing the car, the company takes an average of between 60 and 90 days to reach the best possible sale price for the vehicle. Buyers are able to tap vehicle finance and get seven days or 700km after the sale of a vehicle in which they are able to return it for a money back guarantee. As an example, Ridgway says the company was able to pay a seller an extra R160 000 on a Mercedes-Benz GL350 following the initial R380 000 the seller got on the trade value of the car, before get\\Worth were able to sell it to a buyer for R569 000. Fees made up the difference of R19 000. In another example he provided, a seller was able to get a retail price of R229 000 for their 2013 Audi A1 1.4t Ambition S-Tronic after a search for a buyer after 40 days, upon initially securing a trade price of R175 500 with the company (and after factoring in repair costs). After the deduction of fees the seller was able to get a further R27 000 Ridgway says the founders as well as friends and family have together invested about R10-million in the startup and are now in talks with various investors to obtain R4-million in funding. The company's lean operation also helps to cut costs as the company has no fancy showroom, operating instead from an industrial area of Montague Gardens, where vehicles purchased from sellers are stored in a warehouse. To calculate the best trade price for a client's car the startup deploys machine learning algorithms which consider variables such as retail price points and the car's age and mileage. Initially the three sought to buy an existing dealership with the idea of doing things differently. However, they found that the industry structure was facing huge change and decided it would be better to lead rather than follow. \"It's about disrupting things,\" says Ridgway. While he says the startup will mostly target millennials who are looking to the internet to buy cars, he and fellow co-founders Jamie Surkont (a former CEO of Electronic Toll Collection) and Colin Morgan (former business manager) are all over the age of 40. \"When you get older you get a bit grumpy,\" admits Ridgway, who is 55. The company admits that its main barrier is that of communication and differentiation, because the product is novel and more complex than a straightforward traditional buy or sell. Another challenge is that the company had to reject 40% of the 205 deals valued at R36-million that passed through the platform during March. Ridgway says deals were rejected either because sellers' vehicles were too old, had very high mileage, because the seller was from an outlying area, or because the seller's vehicle financing debt with the bank exceeded the vehicle's possible trade price. Currently there are 17 vehicles up for sale and 25 deals in the pipeline which represents about R8-million in potential revenue, with average deals valued at about R250 000, he says. In the short term, the company, which has seven employees (including the founders) will focus on South Africa and Ridgway says plans are already underway to open a branch in Johannesburg. The company has lodged patents on certain aspects of its product and the founders intend to find offshore partners to assist a roll-out in selected countries. Their immediate aim is to reach 1000 vehicle deals per month and expand to covering other assets and providing additional services, citing financial products as one example.

      "content": "Almost one in five startup founders in Cape Town and Johannesburg are immigrants, reveals a new report. The 2017 Global Startup Ecosystem report, released by StartUp Genome last month, reveals that 18% of founders in Cape Town and 17% in Johannesburg are immigrants - slightly under the average of 19% for the 56 cities measured by the report. In comparison, just four percent of founders in Lagos, Nigeria are immigrants -- significantly below the 46% that are immigrant founders in Silicon Valley. Of the emerging market cities measured, Shanghai tops the list with 36% of startups founded by foreigners. Other notable cities are Berlin (43%), London (42%) and Malta (39%). Silicon Cape director Alexandra Fraser said immigrant founders attracted to Cape Town include those partnering with local companies or those who have registered companies based in foreign jurisdictions but choose to operate out of the city. Fraser said some immigrant founders who count themselves as running a startup in Cape Town have built companies elsewhere and are attracted by the city's beauty and fairly efficient management, as well as good access to capital and talent that the city provides. One such foreign founder is Sylvia Gruber. In 2009 she came from Austria to be with her then South African boyfriend. Being from a corporate background, she never intended to start a business in Cape Town. Since then she has started four businesses, two of which she has since sold (including beauty products business Rubybox) after closing her first business. Today she runs Carechamp.co.za, a technology and marketing platform connecting trained caregivers with people in need of home healthcare services. Gruber said that most of the foreign founders she knows were initially attracted to the beauty of Cape Town and its people. \"Cape Town has such an entrepreneurial climate that I got inspired to start my first business, administratively it was quite easy. \"However it's important to have a visa allowing you to start a business and also allowing you to open up the required bank account for example,\" she said. A parliamentary reply last month by former Home Affairs Minister (now finance minister) Malusi Gigaba is however cause for concern for foreign entrepreneurs looking to set up in South Africa. Gigaba stated that not a single new business visa was approved last year by the department. He added that all 48 applications for new business visas and 148 of the 173 applications for renewal were rejected -- most because of fraudulent supporting documents. StartUp Genome CEO JF Gauthier stressed that the figure the report uses for the percentage of immigrant founders in a city should be seen as a measure of diversity. rather than how many founders are on an immigrant visa or not. \"They (founders) may have moved 20 years prior as an 18-year-old student, might have moved at the same age with their parent, or might have moved to work for a large company... and then founded or co-founded a startup,\" he said.

      "content": "The Geeks on a Plane (GOAP) dinner hosted by Wesgro and Silicon Cape provided many insights into the investment landscape in SA and Africa. The dinner also consisted of a panel discussion with Zoona's CFO, Keith Davis and investors Monica Brand Engel of Quona Capital and co-founder and CEO of Rippleworks, Dough Galen. Speaking at the dinner, was co-founder of Silicon Cape and 4Di Capital, Justin Stanford who spoke on his experience in Silicon Valley and his reason for starting Silicon Cape. He explained to the GOAP cohort and other attendees that his main takeaway from his time in the Valley was the value culture that surrounded it. \"For me, the most useful takeaway I had of value culture was the collaboration, the pay-it-forward approach.\" He compared that experience to what he experienced here in SA upon his return from Silicon Valley. \"Here it's like everyone keeps their cards close to their chest, no one talks about what they're doing... it was like a new secret turf and I wanted to kind of break that open.\" Read more: Geeks on a Plane: A night out in Cape Town Years after Silicon Cape was founded, it was inevitable that the SME ecosystem would evolve and the investment space along with it. According to a report compiled by Wesgro, the 2015 World Investment Report by the United Nations Conference on Trade And Development (UNCTAD) found that SA was, \"The largest African destination for inward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).\" This could be attributed to the country's location, according to Stanford. \"Where we sit in SA is a great bridge to look in those markets in Africa while still having a western grounding. So we have a Western style of business, culture, infrastructure etc,\" he said. Not only is our location ideal according to Stanford, but our nation currently sits on a growth curve that's going to kick in soon. This trend could possibly be because of the growing interest in startups by many South Africans, mentioned Stanford. \"There's this general trend towards 'startups are cool now', it seems like everybody is talking about a startup or somebody wants to invest in your startup, and they can convince someone to invest because they've heard of this 'startup thing'.\" But our location and growing interest in startups aren't the only things that make our country successful in the SME industry. \"We're capable of competing in certain verticals globally,\" said Stanford, who further supported his point by mentioning that we have the ability to straddle both first-world and developing-world problems. Our fintech solutions can be applied in both first-world nations and developing ones. Once Stanford concluded dishing out some of his insights, the Zoona panel discussion commenced with Stanford interviewing Zoona's investors and Zoona's CFO. His first question was directed at Engel of Quona Capital about why they chose to invest so soon in a tertiary country. \"The answer to the question is very similar to the theme of 500 (Startups) which is 'we were in the market'.\" She also went on to mention that Zoona made it incredibly easy to accommodate Quona and meet the team halfway as much as they could. Stanford pivoted the discussion toward SA exchange controls and how they affect foreign investors. Read more: 12 edtech startups teaching South Africans [Digital All Stars] \"It is a significant barrier,\" said Zoona CFO, Keith Davies. \"There are ways you can go about it that'll protect you as a foreign investor bringing your money in, you can get it endorsed by the Reserve Bank which will allow you to take it out,\" he mentioned. Davies elaborated on his previous answer saying that the rules and regulations are becoming a bit more relaxed especially in regards to the tech sector. \"We were on a panel with the Reserve Bank and highlighted the problems and how this is really damaging the ecosystem and they did listen. They have eased up on a few things,\" Davies mentions. According to Davies, the biggest issue SA faces in terms of receiving foreign investment and increasing trust between foreign investors and those receiving investments is time. If you lead with enough time and provide the Reserve Bank with the necessary information sooner, you're able to get through processes much quicker. CEO of Ripple Works, Doug Galen also elaborated on the state of SA's entrepreneurial space, focusing on the Mother City in particular. \"Cape Town is Silicon Valley all over again and I'm excited to be here to experience that, the next 10 years here are going to be fantastic.\" When asked about how to get more investors to invest their time and money in SA, Galen replied, \"You're doing nothing wrong, we just need to get the word out, we just need to find more opportunities for every project that we launch.\" ",

      "content": "It's official, 2016 was the year of the AI startup acquisition. Tech giants Apple, Intel, Twitter and Microsoft have all spent large sums to bring artificial intelligence startups, and their expertise, inhouse. Four of the biggest AI startup acquisitions of the last five years have come from the UK, starting with Google's purchase of Deep Mind in 2014 for a reported PS400 million. Since then Apple has purchased Cambridge-based natural language processing specialists VocalIQ, Microsoft bought the machine learning powered keyboard SwiftKey in February and Twitter acquired Entrepreneur First alumni Magic Pony in June. Here are some of the most interesting startups working in the area of artificial intelligence in the UK today, whether that is machine learning, deep learning, neural nets or computer vision. Could the next Deep Mind be lurking in there? The established security startup from Cambridge, Darktrace, uses machine learning algorithms to spot patterns and catch cyber criminals before they can hit. Cyber threats are created at a rate too fast for security companies to keep up to date, so smart use of machine learning allows Darktrace to, in theory, stay ahead of the criminals. Darktrace uses AI techniques to learn what is normal within a company's network so that it can quickly identify anomalies. According to its website: \"This allows it to detect cyber attacks of a nature that may not have been observed before, the unknown unknowns.\" Darktrace CEO Nicole Eagan told Techworld in 2014: \"People are finally accepting that compromises are happening, regardless of how much perimeter security and malware detection software they've put in.\" Darktrace raised a massive $65 million (PS51 million) investment round led by investment firm KKR in July. BenevolentAI is a UK startup focused on bringing the power of AI and machine learning to the genomics space. The idea is to expedite the traditional research process by ingesting huge amounts of data and literature using proprietary algorithms and NVIDIA's DGX-1 deep learning supercomputer. BenevolentAI then builds tools on top to match the workflow of drug discovery scientists so that they can easily mine and interrogate the data, ideally reducing the time to market for important drugs.  BenevolentAI is one of the best funded AI startups in the UK, bringing in a massive Series A round of PS72 million in a single undisclosed round. London startup Onfido is doing similar work to Darktrace but with identity and background checks. Founded by a trio of Oxford graduates, the platform plugs into various publicly available databases to give employers quick identity verification and background checks for things like driving and criminal records.  In their own words, Onfido's \"intelligent software revolutionises the archaic background checking industry through automated data aggregation and verification\". The company is hiring machine learning and computer vision engineers to build on the smart platform. Onfido raised a strong Series B funding round of $25 million (PS19 million) in April, led by Idinvest Partners. London-based startup Digital Genius is targeting the contact centre with its deep learning technology. The Digital Genius neural network helps agents respond to common customer service queries quicker by first automatically sorting and labelling the metadata and then generating three potential responses, each with a level of certainty attached. Organisations can then set a threshold for automation, so responses the system views as 90 percent accurate could be automatically sent out - like a chatbot - and anything below is sent to the agent to review, for example. The startup claims it can reduce the average handling time for cases by 20 percent. This is especially important as organisations receive queries from more and more digital channels, including social media. Digital Genius's intelligence layer integrates with existing enterprise contact centre software - including Zendesk, Salesforce and Microsoft - so no need to rip and replace existing systems.  The startup has raised $9.85 million (PS8 million) in funding to date from investors including Salesforce Ventures, Bloomberg Beta and Lumia Capital and has a US office in San Francisco. Customers include the Dutch airline KLM, Unilever and L'Oreal. Echobox is building AI for the publishing industry, and claims to have developed \"the world's first artificial intelligence that understands the meaning of content\". Founder Antoine Amann is a Cambridge graduate who worked in publishing with the Financial Times and developed Echobox while at Entrepreneur First in 2013.  Amann wrote in a blog post that Echobox has \"developed an AI platform that takes a large quantity of variables into account and analyses them in real time to determine optimum post performance\". Echobox social is a predictive tool which optimises content for social media, which the startup claims to double referrals from Facebook and Twitter, without having to do your own analytics, A/B testing or content curation. Basically: RIP social media editors. It has worked with the likes of Vice and The Telegraph in the UK media. Echobox raised $3.4 million (PS2.7 million) Series A funding round in July led by Mangrove Capital Partners. Ravelin is the brain child of former Hailo employees who saw that existing anti-fraud technology wasn't fit for the on-demand market. Its machine-learning algorithms are integrated with customer data to give a contextual basis for detecting potentially fraudulent transactions.  COO Nick Lally told Techworld that where rival payment gateways like Stripe analyse transactions, \"we analyse customers\". Lally says there is no cold start problem with its machine learning models, \"when they integrate against our APIs we ask them to backfill data and chargebacks to inspect that and train a model on those. So from day one they get great results\", he said. Ravelin launched commercially nine months, with early customers including Deliveroo and EasyTaxi. It raised PS3 million in October, led by Playfair Capital and included Amadeus Capital and Passion Capital. Stepsize is a startup working on AI to help software developers.  Their first product, Stepsize Layer, is a desktop application for developers that automatically adds context to code bases, so developers have a better view of who wrote a piece of code, when, and why. They do this by pulling together commits, code reviews and user stories to create a timeline for that code. It integrates with Slack so developers can contact the author and ask questions about the code. Three of the co-founders are UCL mathematics graduates, with Matthieu Louis and Nick Omeyer specialising in machine learning for their masters. The team are currently working on pooling data to build and train machine learning algorithms to help software developers. Stepsize is part of the Virgin Media Accelerator Programme. London-based startup Phrasee is aiming its artificial intelligence systems at the marketing sector, using natural language processing techniques to optimise digital marketing messages. As its website states: \"Out of trillions of ways to write something, what are the odds your gut instinct gets it right? The answer: next to none.\" Phrasee integrates with major email service providers and will optimises subject lines and copy to increase open rates. The startup also offers software which prompts marketers to make better calls to action based on the data. The AI engine simulates millions of permutations of copy and makes a prediction based on historic results about what will perform best. This is then fed back into the engine so that it gets better the more you use it. Phrasee raised PS1 million in seed funding led by communications business Next 15, which owns a range of marketing agencies. Grip is the London based startup that is using AI to make networking at events more productive. The startup, formerly known as Networkr, was rebranded in April because, as CEO Tim Groot told Techworld: \"People don't like networking, so we wanted a name open to interpretation.\" Grip collects data from social accounts (LinkedIn, Twitter) and registration data to act as a smart matchmaking service - using a swipe interface - for corporate event goers. Think 'Tinder for networking'. Grip will then deliver a report back to the event organiser to identify how successful the event has been for every user or social segment. Groot told Techworld that the average Grip user made 300 swipes during the Cannes Lions advertising festival this year. When it comes to the AI, Groot says hiring talent to join their engineers in Copenhagen wasn't difficult and that \"matching people in professional setting is an exciting problem to be thinking about\" for their engineers. Grip merged with fellow professional networking startup Intros.at in 2015 and is seeking a funding round later this year. Groot says the company is making revenue from events already, and is working with the likes of Reed Exhibitions and Cannes Lions. Seldon is an AI startup focusing on bringing machine learning capabilities into the enterprise. Seldon creates tools that help data scientists derive value from big data within an organisation quicker, namely processing data and creating algorithms and models.   The platform has two main functions: recommendations and predictions. For recommendations the open source platform captures and logs user actions via an API delivers recommendations based on your models. For predictions Seldon claims it can predict what products a customer is likely to buy so that sales teams can build supervised, learning-based predictive models and pipelines. Seldon.io already works with YouGov, Lastminute.com and RatedPeople.com. and is based out of the Barclays incubator in London. It has raised two undisclosed funding rounds from Techstars. Based in south London, Tractable is an enterprise deep learning consultancy focused on automating tasks that were previously considered too expert for an AI to perform. The website reads: \"Our AI technology combines image recognition and text understanding to interpret unstructured and specialist data, as domain experts do. If your business relies on expert visual analysis or language understanding, our AI can bring drastic performance gains.\" Tractable offers bespoke deep learning solutions depending on its clients requirements, and has built an automated audit claims product for the insurance industry. The team is led by Alex Dalyac, a computer science postgraduate from Imperial College London and Razvan Ranca, a computer science postgrad from Cambridge University. Tractable raised $1.9 million (PS1.4 million) in June last year, led by Zetta Venture Partners. re:infer is currently in private beta, working with companies like ecommerce startup Farfetch. The technology uses deep neural networks in its AI bots that can process and respond to customer queries in natural language. The re:infer platform also pulls all forms of user feedback - email, surveys, social media - into one place and applies AI to make sense of the data. Re:infer is also looking into ways to allow customers to use these chatbots to do their shopping. The founders met while studying in the AI research group at UCL, the same university that the Deep Mind founder Demis Hassabis got his PhD from. re:infer received PS65,000 in funding from the Seedcamp incubator it is currently based out of the Seedcamp incubator in London. The intelligent assistant Cleo's main function is to help you be smarter with your money. It has been developed by computer science graduates Barney Hussey-Yeo and Aleksandra Wozniak, who met as members of Entrepreneur First's fifth cohort.  Cleo works via a messaging platform which, once you give it permission to your account information, can answer questions about your finances. Using deep learning techniques allows Cleo to learn and adapt to your habits and preferences. As the website states: \"Imagine if you had your own team of McKinsey consultants, Goldman Sachs associates and hedge fund analysts whose sole job is to advise you on your money.\" This UK insurtech startup that is in the current Entrepreneur First cohort is building an AI enable insurance adviser. The app says it will be able to inform you if you are under or over insured, if you have duplicate or missing cover and can help you find better cover. You sign up once and then getting new cover only takes one tap. Brolly also acts as a mobile wallet for all of your insurance products, including documents, to be managed in one place. Brolly is currently in beta and says it will launch on iOS and Android in 2016. Another Entrepreneur First alumni, StatusToday collects the metadata created whenever someone within an organisation takes an action on their computer. It then applies machine learning to spot user behaviour patterns. This could help flag anomalies, which could mean an internal breach has occurred, as well as tracking employee productivity and communications. StatusToday raised a $1.3 million (PS1 million) seed funding round in February 2016 from a range of UK venture capital firms (Notion Capital, LocalGlobe, Force over Mass Capital, Entrepreneur First) and several angel investors. New York-based startup Agolo uses artificial intelligence to create real-time summaries of information. Founded in 2012, it was initially created to curate Twitter feeds in order to focus on conversations, tweets and hashtags that were most relevant to its user's preferences. More recently, Agolo has closed a $3.5 million (PS2.7 million) round of funding including investment from Microsoft's corporate investment fund, Microsoft Ventures, among others. Using natural language processing, Agolo scans content, identifies relationships among the information sources, and picks out the most relevant information, all leading to a comprehensive summary of the original piece of information. Developed in Berkeley, California, Bonsai creates software that enables automated management of machine learning algorithms and libraries. Like Agolo, it too announced a new investment of $7.6 million (PS5.8 million), from Microsoft Ventures, along with New Enterprise Associates.  Interestingly, Bonsai's AI framework is based on TensorFlow, a Google-owned machine learning platform and a competitor to Microsoft's CNTK, an open source deep-learning toolkit.  ",

      "content": "Speaking back in April, Andrew Brem, chief digital officer at insurance group Aviva admitted the insurance industry is \"not known for its incredible radicalism\". However, by embracing the UK's quickly growing pool of insurance technology (insurtech) startups, as well as development of mobile apps, investing in digital channels, hiring tech talent and analysing customer data, the UK insurance industry is finally moving into the digital age. Head of digital innovation at Aviva, Paul Heybourne, told Techworld: \"VCs are buzzing with [insurtech] a lot more than they were a few years ago with fintech and payments. Still, we are yet to see any true disruption, so perhaps that is why we are at the top of hype cycle, but it's only a matter of time.\"  Recent research from London accelerator Startupbootcamp InsurTech and PwC, based on more than 1,300 startups across the world, shows that 75 percent of incumbent insurers \"believe the biggest impact to the industry will come from building new products in order to address the changing needs of the customer\". Here are some of the most innovative insurtech startups in the UK trying to build those products today: The very British sounding hourly car insurance startup Cuvva was set up in 2014. In the mobile app you simply enter the registration number and approximate value of the car you are borrowing from a friend or family member, choose the time you want to be covered for, take a picture of the car and Cuvva will get you an instant quote. Cuvva integrates with Facebook so that you can see which of your friends have cars to borrow. Cuvva queries various data sources to check driving licence data (The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's MyLicence scheme), the Claims and Underwriting Exchange and automated fraud protection to verify coverage quicker than legacy players can. Cuvva is based in the Barclays accelerator in London and raised a PS1.5 million seed round led by LocalGlobe in January 2017, bringing its total funding to nearly PS2 million. InMyBag was founded by former head of digital at insurer Zurich, Iain Harper. The idea for the startup came out of some research done by venture capitalist firm Hambro Perks that showed a gap in the insurance market for mobile workers who are reliant on their technology. Aimed at mobile workers, InMyBag insures devices like laptops, phones and cameras. Instead of having to wait weeks for a new device InMyBag works with Amazon Prime and Apple to guarantee same day replacement of the devices by either fixing them or loaning you a device, wherever you are in the world, and will recover your data too. Harper told Techworld that InTheBag wants to \"help first and ask questions later, instead of trying to wriggle out of claims, which has led to the poor reputation of traditional gadget insurance providers\". Plans range from 'the PS1k bag', which covers devices up to a value of PS1,000 including same day resolution, worldwide cover and 1 click CrashPlan recovery for PS11.99/month to 'the custom bag' aimed at workers with lots of kit, such as photographers, for PS30.99 a month.  Brolly is a London-based startup that is uses AI technology to give customers a mobile insurance locker, advisor and shop, cutting down on costly renewals and coverage gaps. Brolly graduated from the sixth Entrepreneur First cohort in September. The mobile app has three core features: locker (stores your existing and expired policy documents), advisor (suggests coverage you may need) and shop, which is due to come online in the summer and will allow customers to purchase policies direct in the app. Brolly is building out its database and machine learning algorithms so that the app can see where you are under or over insured and suggest better deals by surveying the market. The startup that makes it easier to move house Buzzmove is leveraging its data to build a tool for contents insurance. The CEO Becky Downing told Techworld: \"The buzzmove value proposition revolves around the home and people's belongings. We're using innovative new tech to use our existing distribution channels and processes in the removals industry to collect unique and highly accurate data on what people have in their homes.\" Buzzmove is building a tool that Downing says will do for contents what telematic apps did for motor insurance which \"will provide household insurance companies with accurate insight into their customers' household contents. This means that insurance companies can better correlate their premiums to risk and provide customers with a much better deal,\" says Downing. Buzzmove raised a massive PS6 million funding round in August 2016, led by White Mountains Insurance Group. Digital Fineprint is using machine learning technology to make smart insurance policy recommendations to users which opt in to the service, based on their social media data. For example, using LinkedIn data gives a pretty good indicator of income, and Facebook can give a good indicator of a user's appetite for risk when it comes to a life insurance policy. You may well raise your eyebrows following the Admiral-Facebook disaster - where UK insurer Admiral hastily withdrew plans to use Facebook posts to set insurance rates for car owners last year, after Facebook said the scheme breached its privacy rules. However, Digital Fineprint founder Erik Abrahamsson told Techworld that it is company policy to never contravene guidelines in this way. The Oxford graduate Abrahamsson said: \"Insurers are worried about millennials being undersold or wrongly sold policies, so we present what is the right policy for someone using social media.\" Digital Fineprint is currently sat in Accenture's Fintech Innovation Lab in London and has raised PS400,000 in seed funding. Digital Risks is an insurance specialist built for tech companies, offering a flexible, pay monthly Insurance-as-a-Service model. A founder could start out by protecting their laptop and end up with employer liability insurance and insurance against data breaches as the company grows. When it comes to cyber security risk, Digital Risks wants to reach a point where, like with wearables and health insurance, it can use penetration testing to develop dynamic risk models depending on the robustness of a company's security. Digital Risks has raised PS300,000 on Angels Den and is planning another funding round soon. Neos is a London-based startup that packages together best-in-class IoT enabled hardware, 24/7 support and unlimited building and contents home insurance underwritten by Hiscox, all managed from a mobile app.  From the app, customers can look at dashboards or live camera feeds, respond to issues like an intruder alert or a leak and contact the Neos team to get a professional sent out for response. Neos raised a PS1 million seed round from investors including Eos Venture Partners. The Cambridge and London based startup Instanda could be considered the most pure play insurtech company on this list. It offers a management tool for insurers and brokers to build, launch, distribute and monitor new insurance products in a fraction of the time it would traditionally take. So what does that mean? Being tied to legacy insurance software systems means building and delivering new insurance products can be cumbersome at best. Instanda has built a tool which consolidates question sets, underwriting workflow, documentation, a rating engine and the customer journey so that underwriters can respond to changing market demands quicker than before. Instanda raised some non-equity assistance funding from the Microsoft Accelerator in March. Back Me Up is a British startup offshoot of big Belgian insurer Ageas, who they describes as \"a responsible parent who makes sure we do everything properly\". The Back Me Up insurance proposition certainly looks like it was built for the millennial consumer. For PS15 you get coverage for your three most valuable items (say: laptop, camera, bike) as well as phone screen, keys and travel insurance. You simply have to sign up and send pictures of your three items to get them covered. You can also bolt on things like landlord cover, extra items and breakdown cover. Peer-to-peer car insurance was an inevitability, and Guevara looks to be one of the best operators out there. You pay a set amount up front called your Base Price. This is worked out using your age, car, location and experience etc. You are then put into a group with similar people, where the money is pooled together to go towards the group's insurance fees. If the group keeps their claims down then the money in the pool stays there year on year, meaning you could save up to fifty percent on your renewal fee. A chatbot for insurance may sound like a bad elevator pitch, but Spixii has some pretty smart technology behind it. Spixii is an \"automated insurance agent\" which essentially lets you buy and manage your insurance through a chat interface. It is still in beta but essentially it promises the ability to ask Spixii, for example, to insure your bike, when your renewal date is and any other queries you may have when it comes to insurance. Based out of the Startupbootcamp InsurTech incubator in London, Spixii was founded by a self-described \"band of geeks\" from technical and insurance backgrounds, with cofounder Alberto Chierici coming from a data science and actuary background and Renaud Million an actuarial consultant at Ernst and Young. In terms of funding Spixii has been backed by the Startupbootcamp incubator. Blockchain specialist startup Luther Systems is working on a secret bespoke product for insurance giant Aviva around simplifying contracts. Luther promises the ability to create smart contracts using templates before securely distributing them and the receiver can even virtually sign. The insurance industry is naturally interested in how the distributed ledger technology can improve its back office processes and Luther Systems appears to be leading the way with its high profile partnership with Aviva. Little is known about the company but it is based out of the Aviva sponsored Founders Factory accelerator in London. Insly is a cloud based platform for insurance brokers. You can search and manage clients, policies, objects and payments in one place. It is cloud based, so brokers can access the system from anywhere. It is essentially a customer relationship management (CRM) platform - like Salesforce or Workday - for the insurance sector. Insly is a Startupbootcamp Fintech alumni and raised a PS850,000 funding round in January. The claims process tends to be the most painful part when it comes to motor insurance, and the startup Rightindem is trying to smooth it out by giving claims brokers self-service tools for total loss claims. Founded by automotive industry veteran David Stubbs, he claims that their IT tools and call scripting reduce the average claims leakage by over PS500 per claim for its pilot customers. The system is built on an automated vehicle valuation service, which helps claims handlers spend more time with customers and less on admin. The product is currently in private beta and is working with major UK insurer Admiral. It raised a PS500,000 seed round led by Startupbootcamp in December. ",

      "content": "Imagine you're sitting on a white sandy beach in the Caribbean, not a worry in the world, when your phone pings you a notification: there has been a leak at home and your kitchen is slowly filling with water. It's a hypothetical situation I hear a lot when it comes to covering innovation in the insurance sector, an industry not famed for its radicalism, and one I heard again a few weeks ago while chatting to Matt Poll, CEO and founder of Insurtech startup Neos. The solution that companies like Neos aim to create is an app, combined with a whole host of internet of things (IoT) sensors and specialised hardware, which will allow you to turn the mains off remotely, get a repairman called out and make a claim, all from your phone. Poll has been on the other side of the industry, previously at RSA and its sub-brand More Than, and the problem he saw was that \"customers didn't get value from insurance unless they made a claim\". So he went about building an insurer that would \"help prevent the bad things from happening, or at least mitigate them\". The way Neos does this is by offering customers a package of best-in-class IoT enabled smart home devices, 24/7 support and unlimited building and contents cover underwritten by Hiscox, all managed from a mobile app.  It's ambitious, and Poll recognises that the early customer base will skew towards the more affluent and tech savvy, but he believes \"there is a big customer need in the mass market that are interested in our solution\". Essentially the insurance company is making the idea of the smart home more accessible to everyday customers. \"I think with the smart home there has been a lot of hype, and there still is and my personal view is that it is really confusing for customers with different devices and protocols out there.\" So for the past two years the team has been working on a home hub which links up the various devices and gives customers a monitoring platform from the Neos mobile app. From there customers can look at dashboards or live camera feeds, respond to issues like an intruder alert or a leak and contact the Neos team to get a professional sent out for response. Even if your phone is switched off the Neos hub will trigger a response from its loss adjusting partner Cunningham Lindsey to try to contact you or designated key holders and get a tradesperson sent out. The IoT enabled hardware includes two wireless motion sensors from UK manufacturer Fibaro, a Netatmo indoor wireless camera, two Fibaro leak detectors, two Fibaro wireless smoke sensors and two Fibaro window/door sensors. Neos owns the devices and will collect them upon the cancellation of your contract, like a Sky box. \"Our hardware strategy is not to produce hardware,\" Poll said, \"as it is tough and expensive and changes rapidly, a good device today can be superseded in 18 months.\"  Neos won't charge customers any upfront fees except for installation (there is a self-installation option) and it aims to keep its packaged solution, which is currently underwritten by Hiscox, in-line with traditional home insurance premiums. At the time of writing I couldn't make a price comparison to my current home insurance as Hiscox unfortunately wouldn't cover my property (no reason was given). Poll did say that Neos is currently looking to diversify who provides its underwriting and is even looking to do its own as a managing general agent (MGA), but would need to gain regulatory approval first. Poll describes Neos as a \"speedboat as opposed to the large oil tankers\" of traditional insurers. He wants to bring home insurance into the digital world, and that starts with a connected approach that allows customers to manage everything from their phone. Neos launched in London in January 2016 and is planning a big nationwide push this summer. One key channel will be the Zoopla property portal, as Zoopla Property Group (ZPG) invested in Neos back in November and will be pushing the Neos package to its millions of property seekers. ",

      "content": "Investing in startups is a risky business when up to 90 percent of them are destined to fail. Industry analysts like Forrester and Gartner are reaping the benefits, attracting clients from 71 and 74 percent of the Global 500 respectively to their expert insights and market research reports such as the Magic Quadrant. But their foothold could face a new threat in the near future from an emerging disruptor known as GrowthEnabler. The company has devised a series of algorithms that they claim identify the world's most innovative and valuable startups from a wide range technologies, sectors, and locations. GrowthEnabler was founded in 2015 by ex-Gartner executives Aftab Malhotra and Rajeev Banduni. The two had spent almost a decade at the firm when they decided to use their knowledge to start investing in companies. Their stints working with big companies as both advisors and investors convinced the duo that they had discovered a huge business opportunity. \"We realised that these guys were struggling to really identify the next big technology disruption in the startup economy,\" chief growth officer Malhotra remembers. \"The reason they were struggling was because most of the big research companies out there, like Gartner, Forester, IDC were studying organisations that were more developed and more mature.\" As the established technology analysts weren't providing the insights on disruption, Malhotra and Banduni teamed up to do it instead, with a new disruptive venture replacing opinions with automation to identify and score the right startup to invest in. Algorithmic analysis Startups tend to lack the comprehensive information available on listed companies due to the inherent uncertainty of their data. The GrowthEnabler platform is designed to clean up this information. The companies are organised into early-stage, mid-stage, and late-stage startups and then analysed by predefined algorithms that cover thirty parameters across five separate categories: product innovation, business traction, financial strength, leadership and social media and branding. The algorithms encompass both quantitative and qualitative data, applying data mechanisms to the latter to standardise subjective values. Leadership is evaluated by culling data about the background of the founders, including the previous positions and organisations where they worked. A matching engine assesses the level of relevance to the job at the new company. The greater the match between the two roles, the higher the higher chance of the expertise being of value. It also analyses educational background, feeding Forbes and Footsie rating mechanisms back into the platform. Product innovation review benchmarks including patent applications filed by the founders that demonstrate their credibility, while business traction looks at the books through sources such as Companies House. The social media and branding category assesses startups on their media mentions, awards, and social media traction. It covers activity and reach on Facebook and Twitter, engagement and interactions with prominent VCs and any awards won both domestically and internationally. Financial strength is determined through financial data on funding rounds and investment raised from different databases. The  information is then validated through multiple sources \"There about 40,000 high-grade, mid-grade and low-grade investors that we built a list of, and we've tiered them,\" says Malhotra. \"We try to trawl their website as well as validation of the information.\" The results are combined to provide a relative score on the overall value of the startup. The company had previously predominately used a mixture of open source technology but is now increasingly incorporating its own custom creations. \"We're trying to make everything as proprietary and in-house as possible, simply because of security protection and also the venture capital groups like that in terms of our future growth,\" says Malhotra. \"They like things that we created ourselves.\" The business model Dozens of FTSE 100 businesses currently subscribe to the GrowthEnabler service, but Malhotra is reluctant to reveal their names at this point.  \"Our model is unique. It's not just a platform, it's a hybrid service,\" he says. \"You buy the platform but there's a layer of advisory built into it.\" The advisory layer of regular meetings with a seasoned analyst is meshed into the product to add a layer of protection for bigger decisions. Malhotra admits that some of the startups featured were initially concerned about how they would rank but now see the platform as a free business opportunity rather than a potential threat to their reputation. \"With every startup today if you ask them what's the one thing you could have more of, it would be visibility,\" he explains. \"They need money, but not infinite amounts of it, but they need visibility and that's hard. The index is a credible way of getting visibility because someone else is endorsing them aside from themselves.\" A feature called Connect Up acts as a dating agency for corporations to engage with startups after reviewing their profile through a notification system. Another offering called Product Source set for release in three months' time will help C-level executives search solutions to their specific challenges from credible alternatives to tier one companies by analysing their ratings or requesting their suggestions. If a company was losing millions of dollars a year on its supply chain, for example, and wanted software that could optimise warehousing, it could handpick companies it was interested in and automatically feed the challenge to them. It could then analyse their response before deciding whether it was worth further discussion. Future plans The company covers all technology areas, but currently the core strengths are in the areas they've studied in greatest depth, such as the Internet of Things, where a comprehensive report was recently published, and AI, the subject of the next one. Eventually their capacity will fully expand across every sector of the ecosystem. \"The vision that we have here is that this platform is a one of a kind, to the extent that it becomes the most trusted and essential resource you go to try and better understand the idiosyncrasies of the startup economy,\" Malhotra explains. \"It starts with the fundamentals of indexes, scoring, transparency, and consistency that we're trying to bring, and then it evolves into intelligence and various other things. And as part of that comes this idea that if I'm someone in the financial services sector, I want to know about startups that could disrupt me in the financial sector across multiple technology areas: AI, AR, VR, or big data, for example. \"If I am, on the other hand, in the logistics sector, then I want to know about any company who could crush my warehousing and logistics supply chain and I don't want to be destroyed by Amazon in the future. I want to be well aware of this and I want to think 10 steps ahead. \"We've organised our 500,000 startups that we're analysing across 15 technology areas and 20 technology sectors. We're basically saying, no matter where you sit we'll give you a service that's going to be effective.\" ",

      "content": "Historically, the UK has struggled to found cybersecurity companies but that has recently started to turn change. What defines a pure startup is contentious but here we've decided to limit our horizon to the last five years (roughly since 2011) in an effort to sift the fresh from the established and to capture startups that truly count as 'cyber' and not only security.  In he past, celever engineers went to work for GCHQ - will that still be true in the future? By most metrics arguably the most successful UK cybersecurity startup of all time, Darktrace goes from strength to strength. The firm's Enterprise Immune System anomaly detection technology is now resold by BT and at least one US telecoms firm. Founded with investment from Mike Lynch of Autonomy fame, Darktrace's fame rests of the unusual Valley-like speed of its rise. Founded in 2015, CybSafe aims to apply behavioural science to security e-learning programmes specifically to cut down on the risk of human error. The premise is that it doesn't quite matter how much good technology an organisation has in place, if staff aren't trained and aware then a company is still majorly at risk. Speaking with Techworld, founder Oz Alashe says the platform differs from other training programmes because it is based on behavioural science and engages with staff. Some of Cybsafe's competitors out there, he says, will introduce training into organisations as a box-ticking measure. \"The key differentiator for us is our platform, which is a GCHQ-accredited awareness training programme, is more than a training programme,\" Alashe says. \"It's focused not just on imparting information but assessing changes in behaviour, so we simulate attacks in order to make sure people know what they should know, and behaving in a way throughout the course of the year that should be improving.\" ZoneFox is an Edinburgh-based startup that uses AI to examine, but not interfere with, network behaviour and provide actionable insight and alerts to suspicious activity.  It recently completed a round of Series A funding led by investment from Archangels, and the company is planning to triple its headcount and build a team in London. Current customers include Rockstar Games and Zenith Bank, and the business has its sights set on the financial, pharmaceutical and gaming sectors. The company claims its machine learning-enabled Zonefox AI is the \"most advanced User Behaviour Analytics platform on the market\", with the crucial difference of only combing the data that it needs. StatusToday brands itself as \"artificial intelligence that understands human behaviour\" - a platform that uses machine learning to try to make sense of human behaviour in the workplace, which could include insider attacks but also plain human error. The company raised PS1 million in seed funding in February 2016 from venture capital firms including Notion Capital, LocalGlobe, Force over Mass Capital, Entrepreneur First, and angel investors. It recently completed an incubator programme with Britain's signals intelligence agency GCHQ. Here, the company gained access to senior experts at the agency the technical and commercial spheres, and cofounder Ankur Modi says that StatusToday's machine learning capability \"certainly improved as a result of the conversations and discussions we've had with them.\" Founded in 2011 and developing in careful steps since then, Digital Shadows is based on a databases-driven 'awareness' system that searches across the shadier side of the Internet looking for the chatter associated with threats against specific firms. Imagine forensics 'before the fact'. Profiled by Techworld in 2015. Co-founded by a core group of engineers who worked at BAE Systems, CyberLytic recently emerged from a spell in the CyLon incubator where it developed an automated tool for responding to cyberattacks. Passed through the CyLon accelerator in London as a mentor, SQR is the Bristol University spin-out that has made its mark by creating one of the first business-class secure messaging apps for video, data and voice with end-to-end security and manageability. Secure messaging has hitherto been a consumer application but its potential foor businesses could turn out to be fundamental. Techworld recently covered the brand new Silicon:Safe, almost unique among UK security startups in that it has invested its development cash in a hardware-based product that protects credentials with a radical architecture in which data enters but never leaves an appliance. The system's inventors claim it can't be hacked because once placed there data can never leave. Founded in London by the Tuvey brothers (who sold ScanSafe to Cisco in 2009), Wandera is a cloud SaaS platform enforcing mobile security that can detect threats in real time. Founded by a core of graduates of Queen's University Belfast, the firm's Enterprise platform allows encrypted, centralised communications, particularly for mobile devices. Flush with $3 million in US venture funding, now based in the US but we still count them as British for the UK start. Another almsot new name, Corvid is an independent 'spin in' of larger UK company Ultra Electronics that offers real-time security-as-a-service. Another of the small group of firms based in Cheltenham and recently profiled by Techworld. Spent time inside the FinTech Innovation Lab accelerator as well as returning the favour for Cyber London, Ripjar is a data intelligence platform that can be used for a variety of tasks, including monitoring feeds such as social media for threats, customer and reputation mamangement. Winner of the Most Innovative Small Cyber Security Company award at last year's Infosecurity Show, under its Ascema brand, Wales-based GeoLang has pioneered sophisticated data loss prevention for today's demands, scoring customers as large as Jaguar-Landrover. The latter uses it to keep track of its large and complex cache of documents covering sensitive IP. Profiled by Techworld. ",

      "content": "The cowboy builder stereotype may be largely an unfair one, but one enduring element of it that remains true is the prevalence of haggling instead of set pricing. Construction sector startup BUILT/ plans to transform that model by digitising the customer experience in a mobile-optimised web store that gives builders a better deal. Founder Nick Thomas developed BUILT/ because the market for building supplies had yet to undergo any digital transformation.  The tradespeople were no Luddites in their personal uses of technology, but a data deficit in a complex supply chain, heavy equipment and a reliance on personal relationships had previously limited its application to sales in the sector.  \"The digital behaviours are there, they're just not transferring to their professional lives,\" he says. \"They actually do want to adopt, they just need to be presented with something.\" A new generation of builders more familiar with e-commerce and a growing desire for the common retail principle of price transparency convinced Thomas it was now ripe for digital disruption.  Any sale of building materials is always negotiated face-to-face. BUILT/ intends to change that by adding transparency to pricing. \"The traditional marketplace is characterised by a personal relationship between the general builder and your branch manager,\" says Thomas. \"It's a personal relationship, and that's how the customer develops trust with the brand.\" The mass adoption of smartphones has made the old model of negotiating prices vulnerable by giving the ability to instantly search the market for more competitive prices. Builders were increasingly craving consistency in the availability of stock and more transparent pricing to match the majority of other retail sectors. \"The retail basics of range, price and proximity are never going to go away; they're always the top three things that tradespeople say are important,\" says Thomas. \"But what they all crave is consistency in the availability of stock in particular. They want consistency of service but they also want this transparent pricing. \"There isn't that much loyalty to the big names. They will say that personal relationship is vital, but you give them something better or something that is cheaper and it will ebb away.\" To provide a service to replace this, he first needed to develop an entire dataset through discussions with suppliers. All of the information on pricing, inventory controls and product descriptions needed to be constructed from the ground up, as such a database didn't yet exist in the industry. When that was completed he was ready to provide a platform to sell the materials. Thomas previously established a fashion and footwear retail business called Cloggs.co.uk which he grew from nothing to a PS12 million business with no external funding before selling it to JD Sports in 2013. His next role as e-commerce and multichannel director at discount bookstore The Works led to the development of a scalable multichannel platform that transforming stagnant website trading performance into a thriving e-commerce business. He then became the group digital and eVentures director at Travis Perkins, the UK's largest builders' merchants, which now provides BUILT/ with the supporting local infrastructure and relationships to overcome the many barriers to entry into the market. They helped him build an omni-channel platform on the NetSuite unified cloud commerce platform, which houses all the information for customers, their orders and suppliers in one place to provide a consistent and transparent service. The system shows real-time product availability online and gives shops access to the inventory from anywhere in the business Builders can source materials on a project-by-project basis by providing transparent fixed pricing online and a choice of how to receive their orders. Customers can receipt order by either delivery or click and collect or just by showing up in store. Builders can set up an online account to review their purchase history and balance and pay their invoices online.  They can create a project product list online and then visit a local store, where a salesperson can access the list and finish the purchase in store.  If the builder isn't ready to purchase any items they can instead add them to their e-commerce cart or list and complete the transaction at a later date. BUILT/ will start small and grow fast when it launches in the UK later this year. \"Our mission is to make the entire purchasing experience as painless and efficient as possible,\" says Thomas. \"Greater convenience and ease of doing business rank among our customers' top priorities.\" ",

      "content": "The City of London, or the Square Mile as it is often known, is synonymous with traditional financial services firms. However a recent report shows that the exclusive London enclave is looking to attract more technology startups in a bid to modernise its image. Fintech, insurtech and regtech are all booming areas within the London startup ecosystem, and the City of London Corporation is starting to ask itself if it needs to provide dedicated spaces for these startups to work within the confines of the City, in closer proximity to the companies they are looking to disrupt or augment. This will require a change in perceptions of the area, which tends to be seen as a traditional and expensive place to do business. The report conducted by the City of London Corporation and City Property Association (CPA) states: \"Young, nimble and digitally focused businesses are challenging decades old incumbents, and the City must adapt once more, responding to the cultures, practices and aspirations of such companies to stay a vibrant, populated area of commerce.\" Andy Pyle, the UK head of real estate at KPMG, told Techworld: \"The City at its core has been dependent on financial services, but as they are disrupted, and with Brexit, there will be some jobs likely to move out of London, so diversification is important.\" The first step for the City will be changing these perceptions if it is to attract a different type of worker. The report asks: \"Is an area comfortable with a traditional business week ready to meet the demands of employees who work when and how it suits them? Could it be that internet connectivity, public transport and street-level coffee culture are better served in the surrounding creative and tech enclaves of Shoreditch, Spitalfields and Smithfield?\" The report lays out its strategy for changing this, starting with a flagship, branded accelerator in the City: \"Most City property owners feel that a single, City-branded accelerator/incubator space would be the best way of attracting emerging technology and facilitating an exchange of ideas between small companies and established firms.\"  As it stands the City is flagging when it comes to shared coworking spaces in the area, with very few of London's accelerators and incubators located within the Square Mile. Pyle from KPMG points to the success of the Level 39 accelerator in Canary Wharf as a good example of how this 'clustering' approach can change the feel of an area quickly. The City is apparently looking at tech clusters in Sydney like Silicon Harbour and the transformation of the King's Cross area in London as blueprints. King's Cross has done a great job of transforming the retail offering around the station since the new station concourse opened in 2012. The area now counts Google and a number of tech startups as residents. Despite the perception that areas like Shoreditch are cheaper than traditional spaces like the City, data in the report shows that rents are homogenising across the whole of London. Naturally, cost will always be an issue when it comes to office space, and worryingly the report found that although landlords are supportive of attracting emerging technology businesses to the City, they are \"hesitant to offer discounts or enticements\". The City of London Corporation recognises its role in changing this, and says it will \"need to convince them that the wider benefits of attracting startups will mitigate the possible lower valuation of buildings containing tech companies\". \"Now that the value of diversity is being recognised, owners feel that they can work with the City of London Corporation to shift perceptions, create cohesive public spaces and refit offices that suit a wider range of needs. The City can become a 24/7 hub with a social aspect.\" Speaking with Techworld, Daisy Gleeson, marketing and PR manager at insurtech startup Digital Fineprint, said: \"As rental costs in more traditional start-up locations such as Shoreditch are rising, it is causing entrepreneurs to look for more affordable office space elsewhere. \"It would of course be preferred to be within the City where there is such a high concentration of financial companies... The major downside is that the average cost of an office in the Square Mile is PS90 per square foot per annum, which is probably too much for young startups.\"  Ishaan Malhi, CEO and founder of online mortgage broker Trussle, told Techworld: \"My perception is that the area has been prohibitive to startups from a cost and culture perspective. The City has been hugely successful in attracting large and high-salaried companies to the area and many of the surrounding cafes, restaurants, and shops accommodate for that audience as a result.\" There are still some clear preconceptions that will have to be ironed out if the City is to become a true melting pot of old and new. Startups responded to the authors of the report with concern that they will be \"seen as second-class citizens within the Square Mile\" and are wary of becoming \"marketing initiatives for a corporate innovation agenda\". Despite respondents from large corporates saying that they \"unanimously believe that they would reap the benefits of being in close proximity to young, innovative companies\" those from the tech sector displayed concern \"about the threat of exploitation by large corporates\". Incumbents also fear a dilution of the \"historic context of the City\" and are wary of the trendy fads of startup culture infiltrating the area. The report states: \"While the likes of street food and outdoor cinema events sound appealing, interviewees noted that the City remains a working environment, so the needs of more traditional occupiers must be considered in respect to crowds, access and noise.\" The report outlines the lure for the area to tech startups: \"Access to talent and expertise, a huge potential for commercial partnerships with established players and an explosion in demand for digital products within finance.\" Becky Downing, CEO of insurtech startup Buzzmove, told Techworld: \"The City has great transport links and locating in the City would be a great way to reiterate our message that we're open for business and ready to partner with more insurers on our latest blockchain-based product offering.\"  However, she is resistant to the Silicon Roundabout cliches that the report hints at. \"While cafes and outside meeting spaces can be useful, that's more for early-stage startups,\" Downing said. \"What we'd really need is plenty of office meeting space and completely reliable broadband connections. We're not really interested in hanging out with startups as much as we are partners and customers. We're not seeking to be \"cool\", we're seeking more growth, more success and more partnerships.\" Also, modern startups don't appear to value physical proximity to potential customers or partners as much as the report assumes. Downing said: \"In today's connected age, physical proximity to insurance companies is really not that important from a practical perspective. But the psychological impact of being right next door would be much greater - both for our existing and future insurance partners, and for our customers, knowing that we're located in Britain's most prestigious financial district.\"  This mirrored comments from Phoebe Hugh, cofounder and CEO of insurtech startup Brolly, who told Techworld: \"In reality, being in walking distance doesn't provide enough tangible value to us for it to influence our decision of where to be based, being in London is good enough. We also like being an outsider in a sense, as it gives us adequate space to focus on evolving the industry, whilst not being too attached to the 'now'.\" ",

      "content": "Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has launched a startup accelerator programme to help late-stage healthtech startups get their technology adopted by the National Health Service (NHS). Speaking to Techworld, Dr Hamish Graham, a practicing surgeon and London manager for the Pfizer Healthcare Hub, said it \"will provide a platform for start-ups to harness Pfizer's global network, enabling them to get access to our expertise, understanding and guidance. We hope, with our support, that they'll be able to reach their goals and get their innovations adopted within the health service.\"  Pfizer says tech like healthcare devices, apps, wearables and virtual reality is potentially transformational for the healthcare industry. The initial programme will help just three startups, and is focusing on companies which have developed a product or service ready for use by healthcare professionals. Graham gave the example of a startup that has made a wearable with a CE mark or software proven in one area, say law or education, and is interested in entering the healthcare space, as the sort of solutions they are looking for. Startups in healthcare face an enormous challenge when it comes to getting their products adopted by the sprawling NHS, but the potential rewards are massive. \"You have to understand their language if you want to get your tech adopted there,\" Graham said, \"You have to understand their priorities and it is a challenge for a lot of startups. They can be fluent in their coding, product development and put a great team together but they then struggle to expand to hospital two, three and four, because they need to communicate their value in a way that a manager can understand it.\" He does recognise that no one solution will be a silver bullet for the NHS's digital struggles. Bluntly: \"If you believed you could find a silver bullet, and get it into the NHS in twelve months, you wouldn't understand the NHS well enough. You can't do that journey in your bedroom, you have to be out there working with hospitals, IT departments and patients.\" Naturally Pfizer isn't the only big four pharmaceutical company casting its eye towards healthtech in the drive for innovation. AstraZeneca recently launched a tie-up with UK healthtech startup Umotif, which focuses on digital patient data capture techniques for doctors and clinical researchers. GlaxoSmithKline is also looking towards the technology sector to try and improve its data capture for clinical researchers. The drugmaker was reportedly in talks with US chip maker Qualcomm last year to more efficiently collect and analyse data from clinical trials. GSK's consumer health division is also looking for \"patent-protected innovations in early- or late-stage development\" in four areas: \"medication adherence, health and symptom tracking, diagnosis/self-selection and treatment.\" The drugmaker wants these digital tools to compliment its existing over the counter medicines and in exchange offers \"GSK's deep understanding of consumers and clinical research experience.\" The difference with Pfizer's approach is that it doesn't necessarily want to license or \"co-create\" solutions with these startups, rather than simply help them get to market. \"What is important for Pfizer is we're not taking any equity and don't want to own anyone's IP and they can work with anyone they want to,\" Graham said. \"If you look at some of the other accelerators, they are quite big on mandatory training requirements and contact time and they may have KPIs around growth or employment in an area, we're not tied by any of those strings.\" Graham realises the Pfizer name doesn't always have positive connotations. \"We could be intimidating to small companies,\" he admits. \"I can say that we don't want IP or equity but I'm not sure how many smaller companies are ready to trust us with that message.\" By starting with just three companies Pfizer says it will be able to offer them personalised support, whether they need help with marketing, health expertise or just a rolodex. \"What we are trying to do is spend enough time with them making sure they have the assets they need and knowing what to say or who to say it to and getting them out there in front of the right people to get that tech adopted,\" Graham said. In terms of internal measures of success for the programme Graham says they have just one key performance indicator (KPI): \"To get the tech adopted by NHS trusts. At the end of 12 months that's how we know if we have done a good job. Are there people using it? We've got no other KPIs.\" So what's in it for them? Good PR, for one. Pfizer was fined a record PS84.2 million by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for overcharging the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug in December. Pfizer is appealing the decision, but helping its biggest customer - the NHS - overcome major problems will score the company some much needed brownie points. Finally, delving into the healthtech world will help Pfizer stay abreast of innovation across the entire healthcare space, not just the high-end drug discovery space. Startups have until 30 April to apply. They will compete for a share of a grant of PS56,000 and a year-long programme of support, including access to contacts within the UK health industry. Pfizer will not ask for any transfer of intellectual property or equity in the business. Applicants will present to Pfizer and a panel of experts at a pitch event at the company's UK HQ on May 18, and the winners announced in June. Startups can apply at: healthcarehub.pfizer.co.uk. ",

      "content": "Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) revenues are set to rocket from PS4.2 billion in 2016 to more than PS130 billion in 2020 according to research from the International Data Corporation. The UK plays home to a number of emerging players in the industry hoping to cash in on the boom. A recent report by GrowthEnabler estimated that of more than 800 companies working in the segment worldwide, more than 150 are based in the Britain. Here's our pick of the ones to watch out for. Immerse Learning has developed a live training platform to let multiple users join global classrooms to learn in 3D and VR scenarios. Live voice and automated reporting run throughout the sessions while the VR lets participants touch and handle 3D objects. The platform provides critical training in skills such as surgery in a non-critical envirnoment with interactive equipment. Users can instantly switch between the VR gamified learning and a webcam to add face-to-face interaction as required. Air France used Immerse to train pilots remotely, offshore drilling contractor ENSCO for offshore lifeboat safety tuition, and the British Council to provide language courses for young professionals in Saudi Arabia in different virtual environments such as hotels and hospitals. Blippar is a visual discovery and AR app that uses smartphone cameras to overlay information onto the physical world. The CEO and cofounder of Blippar is Ambarish Mitra, was named the Ernst & Young UK Entrepreneur of the Year in October. He will represent the country at the World Entrepreneur of the Year competition in Monaco next June. The company was founded in 2011 and has attracted a disclosed funding total of $99 million dollars, $54 million of which was invested by Khazanah Nasional and the remaining $45 million from Qualcomm Ventures. AR startup WaveOptics designs high-quality and affordable next generation AR lenses that can be adapted to multiple forms including everyday spectacles. The technology developed by the Oxfordshire-based company uses ultra-thin waveguides and photonic crystals instead of conventional augmented reality projection to keep hardware lightweight and energy-efficient. WaveOptics was established in 2014 and has attracted investment from Imperial Innovations, Octopus Ventures, Robert Bosch Venture Capital and the aforementioned Blippar across two separate funding rounds. University of Oxford students Arfa Rehman and Scott Gorman founded VRTU in January 2017 to provide a new way of treating people with dementia by creating reminiscent experiences in virtual reality. The technique known as \"reminiscence therapy\" is common in traditional treatment facilities, but a VR version is more affordable and accessible, while the added immersion makes it engaging and visceral. The startup's name is a disemvoweled \"Virtue\", signifying the developers' aim to add compassion to VR. The app is fittingly available as a free download for patients and researchers, and a monthly fee of PS49 for elderly care facilities. The team was recently accepted on the Augmentor accelerator programme. Visual immersion in VR already inspires awe, but adding motion is an ongoing challenge. The ROVR treadmill proves that the VR experience needn't be a sedentary one. The walking platform reduces simulation sickness by placing VR users in waist-high treadmills resembling a child's playpen.  It was designed by engineers at Wizdish, \"the first locomotion company for the new age of Virtual Reality\". The company was founded in 2009 and is currently seeking funding. Improbable is developing a platform to model reality in virtual spaces that offer new levels of scale and complexity. Its first product since it was formed at the University of Cambridge in 2012 is SpatialOS, a cloud-based engine to power virtual environments.  The company has already worked on projects ranging from a game called MetaWorld to a collaboration with the British government that recreated the entire internet to detect weaknesses.  Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm that was an early backer of Facebook, has invested $20 million in the startup. The Brighton-based AI company is bringing emotional interaction to VR with technology that tracks human expressions by reading electrical systems generated by movement through sensors in headsets. The wafer-thin system known as faceteq measures feelings through facial gestures and biometric responses and provides a new way for researchers, educators and creative agencies to study human interactions.  Emteq is also developing treatment for facial palsy and wearables that sense and respond to signs of drowsiness. The company was founded in 2015 and is currently raising seed money. Ultrahaptics was co-founded by University of Bristol PhD research student Tom Carter following student research on using ultrasound to simulate touch. It claims to be the only company that lets people feel and manipulate virtual objects in the air. The technology uses ultrasound to project sensations onto a hand and has the potential to be used for gaming, household appliances, driving and multimedia. IP Group Plc and Woodford Investment Management have invested $16.55 million in the startup since it was founded in 2013. Immersive Rehab's VR platform is designed to support psychical and neuro-rehabilitation through interactive physiotherapy games. They increase the effectiveness of contemporary treatment in an engaging environment through exercises with virtual objects in a 3D world that can convince the brain that the physical exertion is real. The solution is particularly beneficial for people with upper limb mobility limitations who often lack the necessary strength for the physical demands of traditional rehabilitation by reducing the physical barriers and clearly quantifying the benefits. The company was founded by engineering sciences and biomedical engineering PhD graduate Dr Isabel Van De Keere in September 2016 following her own physical rehab due to an accident at work. In March 2017 it entered the ten-week incubator and accelerator programme Augmentor. Opto Air is the first portable VR headset to be produced with built-in audio. The speakers are integrated into a wraparound VR headset with large lenses and interchangeable magnetic covers. London startup Opto designed the headset for casual users seeking an affordable headset for day-to-day activities such as watching movies and viewing photographs. A Kickstarter campaign launched after Opto was founded in January 2016 that aimed to raise PS40,000 had reached PS43,858 at the time of writing. Liverpool-based Kinicho wants to deliver 3D audio tools for producers to create fuller listening experiences for VR and other immersive applications. The company name combines the Greek words for kinetic (\"kin\") and audio (\"icho\"), reflecting the focus on moving sound in a 3D space. The startup is developing two separate products: a pop-up 20-speaker audio array known as Cosmos, and an audio engine called Sympan for high fidelity immersive 3D audio for ambisonics and bionaural reproduction. Kinicho was founded in 2014 by serial digital entrepreneur, coder and enterprise theorist Garry Haywood and audio specialist in residence at the Foundation for Creative Art and Technology (FACT) Stefan Kazassoblou and is another startup to enter the Augmentor accelerator in March 2017. HoloLamp is marketed as the first portable device to offer an AR experience that needs neither a headset nor hands to view. The system combines a pico projector cameras, computer vision and machine learning to create spatial augmented reality. The desktop device resembles an interactive hologram and is designed for gaming, holographic communication and education. The startup was established in July 2016 and plans to launch a crowd funding campaign to attract investment in the near future. Scottish startup Zappar wants to bring the world to life one zap at a time through a free app that lets you reveal hidden virtual content behind physical objects with a simple swipe on a smartphone. The app was developed at the University of Cambridge and uses smartphone cameras to access information about anything with a \"Zapcode\" icon. Brands who have used Zappar include Warner Brothers, Coca-Cola and Manchester City. Zappar has been self-financed from its operating revenue since it was founded in 2011 and is yet to receive any external venture capital funding. Visual-wise creates photo-realistic 3D designs of buildings that strapping on a headset lets you walk around and view the property before it's even been built. The startup was created in 2011 to makes virtual reality accessible to architects and has been tested by and is currently looking for angel investors. Purcell Architects has already tested the toolset to demonstrate how a proposal for a new extension to a London church would appear once constructed. Gravity Sketch has the lofty goal of transforming digital creation. The London-based startup wants its product to bridge the gap between the growing demand for 3D content and the lack of digital 3D literacy among the general public by making affordable and easy VR design software. The company began life in October 2013 as a research project at the Royal College of Art. The four Innovation Design Engineering students were experimenting with existing 3D design gadgets and decided to develop their own prototype. The result is the first 3D creation tool designed for touch and gesture input.  A limited public beta version of the software was launched in January for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Gravity Sketch was founded in September 2014 and has since attracted an undisclosed amount of grant funding and non-equity assistance from Imperial Create Lab. London startup Reality Zero One is building a platform to digitally replicate real objects and then stream the results in virtual worlds and is another recent entrant to the Augmentor programme. Its solution takes images from scans or uploads that are then reconstruction in the cloud and delivered to VR or AR devices. The end-to-end system promises an easy and accessible system to replicate reality in stunning 3D. The company began life in 2015 with a prototype VR app, but it functioned too slowly, so they began to automate the process. In the second quarter of 2017 Reality Zero will release its first commercially available 3D capture system. Mixed reality gaming platform Koski combines physical and digital gaming in a digital iPad app using real toy blocks to build objects. The device's camera and object recognition help the wooden bricks with magnetic joints come to life in a virtual world where characters and stories develop on screen. The gameplay develops with the actions of the player when they put different tokens on top of the bricks that represent different objects and behaviour in mazes, quests, and problem-solving situations. Koski developed from the Vaclav Mlynar's final project at the Royal College of Art in London, where he was studying a master's degrees in product design with Jakub Pollag. They've been supported by the Augmentor accelerator and plan to soon launch a Kickstarter campaign. The augmented reality property platform lets users view properties on an Android and iOS app by pointing a camera at a Virtual View App-enabled image to access content including photo galleries, videos and 3D property models and floor-plans. Vieweet uses a fisheye lens to let estate agents and house sellers market their properties with fully interactive 360 virtual tours. In June 2014, three months after it was founded, Vieweet won the Barclays Techstars Accelerator Programme. The accelerator has provided an undisclosed amount of seed funding. Curiscope produces a \"Virtuali-Tee\" that uses mixed reality to learn about the human body. Hovering over the design with a smartphone let the working organs underneath come to life on-screen. Placing the phone into a VR headset adds to the immersion. A Kickstarter campaign for Virtuali-Tee has already surpassed the PS70,000 target set by Curiscope, which was founded in 2015. The London-based startup was established in 2015 has also created a 360-degree video called \"Great White Sharks\" to lets viewers swim with the fearsome fish that won a Proggy Award from PETA. Surreal Vision has developed software that creates a virtual stimulation of the physical world that can be used in any condition whether at day or night. The technology creates an up-to-date model of everything that is present in the environment and has the potential to create a true telepresence between people in different locations.  The company was founded by three PhD students at Imperial College London in 2014. The next year, it was acquired by OculusVR for an undisclosed amount. Production studio Visualise produces VR viewing experiences to add an immersive presence to marketing campaigns. Since it began life in 2012, Visualise has added a VR touch to driving at the Audi test centre, skiing through DNA Alpine VR and tourism with Thomas Cook's \"Try Before You Fly\" campaign, The company provides video production, binaural sound, CG VR Production, live streaming, post-production, and app building services. Its rapid rise has been entirely self-funded. Scottish startup Two Big Ears develops immersive and interactive audio applications and tools to add cinematic audio to VR and AR.  The company has developed a cross-platform binaural engine called 3Dception that combines real-time 3D audio, geometry-based sound reflections and an environmental modelling engine that reflects minor aural changes in specific locations. Facebook purchased the company in May 2016, three years after two University of Edinburgh graduates founded it. The London-based startup wants to unite gaming and online shopping by creating virtual stores for real-time 3D browsing. Online retailer ASOS purchased a 10 percent stake in Trillenium and world number one tennis player Andy Murray has partnered with equity crowdfunding firm Seedrs to invest PS200,000 in the company. This startup was founded in 2009, and also offers VR services for travel, real estates, and prototype testing. Former racing videogame developer Darren Jobling founded Zerolight in 2014 to give car dealerships, flagship stores and pop up shops a virtual showroom of their to drive sales  Customers an immersive experience of the product can explore and interact with cars thanks to real-time 3D visualisation, and even take them for a spin with a virtual test drive. The multi-platform digital car configurator has attracted clients including Audi and Jaguar and has raised PS916,000 seed funding from Northstar Ventures and Prime Ventures. Proteus VR Labs was formed to create VR products that fit in with real user behaviour. The company was founded in 2013 and is financially supported by seed funding. The first product released by the startup is the smartphone adapter Freefly. Bjork fans who bough the Icelandic singer's 2915 LP Vulnicura were supplied with the headset to experience her Stonemilker music video in VR. The Freefly headset provides a 120 degree field of vision, a figure that is superior to the 110-degree provided by both the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive and the 96-degree of the Samsung Gear VR. Altergaze claims to be the only Virtual Reality company offering HMD's that can be specifically tailored to an individual's aesthetic tastes. Customers can either order a fully printed and assembled model or 3D print, assemble and sell their own headset designs through the hacker.agvr platform. The headset can be upgraded alongside the smartphone that fits inside it and uses a 50mm diameter multi-lens optical to provide a high-quality visual display unit. The company was founded in 2014 and is funded by Kickstarter. Music startup MelodyVR catalogues live performances filmed in VR so music-lovers can enjoy concerts by their favourite artists at home through a VR headset. MelodyVR provides new vantage points to gigs, ambisonic audio for an immersive listening experience, and the option to eliminate interference for a crystal-clear studio sound quality. The service will launch later this year. The startup was founded in 2015 and is supported by holding company EVR Holdings, which raised PS3.4 million on the London stock exchange in September 2016 to fund a planned US expansion. Augmented reality video games have already exploded into the mainstream thanks to the roaring success of Pokemon GO. Flying the flag for the UK is virtual reality board game Kazooloo. Players use Kazooloo to bring a traditional board game to life through a smartphone or tablet. Its game was selected as one of The Gadget Show's top ten tech products for 2016. froom Gorali Eran and Plarium.com committed $1.5 million of seed funding to the company in 2014, just one year after it had been founded. The wireless all-in-one headset from the York-based company uses a built-in computer and a Wi-Fi chip to create an affordable, untethered VR experience. Auravisor made headlines in April by teaming up with virtual reality pornography company VR Bangers to offer guests at Las Vegas hotels a headset preloaded with porn called the \"VR Bangers Hotel Experience.\" The crowd-funded startup was founded in 2015 and is said to be the world's first production ready wireless VR headset.

      "content": "Tech IPOs [initial public offerings] could be heading for a quiet period. Many investors believe we're set to see the market cool off, after a number of startup 'unicorns' (firms thought to be worth over $1 billion) failed to deliver promised returns in 2015. The number of tech firms that launched on the stock market fell to a seven-year low this year, according to the Wall Street Journal. Many startups are choosing to stay private (see Uber, Airbnb, Snapchat) or exit by selling up to another firm. And it's no surprise. Venture capitalists joke 'IPOs are the new down round' (when a startup raises less capital than its previous valuation), pointing to companies like Square, Groupon or Box who went public at a lower price than planned. Music-streaming firm Deezer pulled plans to go public in October, after it failed to convince investors it merited its price tag of $1.1 billion. However you'd be wrong to think it's all doom and gloom. Over here in the UK, there have been some notable recent successes.  Last year in the UK web security firm Sophos raised PS352 million on the London Stock Exchange, meaning it's now worth over PS1 billion, and in November 2015 software reseller Softcat saw its shares jump 20 percent on the first day of trading. Payments firm Worldpay raised PS2 billion in the UK's biggest IPO in 2015 in October 2015. Here are the upcoming UK tech IPOs you should keep your eye on next... A holding company with three businesses operating within the clean technology sector, specialising in solar, absorption and filtration tech.  When is the IPO? Tuesday 2 May 2017  How much do they hope to raise? PS3.5 million ",

      "content": "The taxi-hailing app is considered both brilliant and controversial, depending on who you ask. Here we've documented the company's journey to a $50 billion valuation. Disclaimer: it's been a bit of a bumpy one... 13 April 2017 Using a software programme called 'Hell', Uber has been secretly tracking Lyft drivers, The Information reports. Uber used 'Hell' to create fake Lyft accounts which meant it could monitor how many drivers were available for new rides and what their location was. This comes a few months after Uber staff were caught spying on celebrities and former partners using a tool called 'God's View', now called Heaven. Read more on this below. 10 April 2017 Uber has been ordered to stop all activities across the entirety of Italy, Reuters reports. The ban comes after courts ruled that Uber represents unfair competition for taxi drivers, claiming that Uber doesn't respect transportation laws. Uber has been granted 10 days to stop all its activities including any advertising and marketing campaigns. After that, the company must pay EUR10,000 (PS8,533) per day if it continues to operate. 20 March 2016 After joining the company less than six months ago, Uber president Jeff Jones is stepping down, in a move that was \"completely unexpected\" by colleagues. The BBC reports that Jones grew frustrated that a new COO was being appointed and he was not being considered for the position. However, according to Recode, Jones's departure is due to Uber's ongoing controversies surrounding sexism and sexual harassment. In a statement on Sunday Uber said: \"We want to thank Jeff for his six months at the company and wish him all the best.\" Read more here. 13 March 2017 Uber announced last week that it's shutting down its UberTAXI service in London, as of the 31 March 2017.  Launched in 2014, UberTAXI lets Uber customers hail black cabs through its mobile app, rather than a normal Uber car. \"Since we first launched UberTAXI, hundreds of black cab drivers have taken tens of thousands of trips through the Uber app. However, in recent months, those numbers have tailed off,\" said Uber in a blog post published Friday afternoon. \"At Uber we always want our riders to be able to get a car whenever they want and wherever they are - no matter which option on our app they choose. That hasn't been the case recently with UberTAXI, which is why we will be ending this option on 31 March,\" it added. In the statement, Uber said that it would be focusing on car-sharing options and even fully electric cars. 1 March 2017 Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has apologised after a video obtained by Bloomberg showed him in a heated exchange with Uber driver Fawzi Kamel. Kamel expressed his distress at the way Uber treats its drivers, even telling the CEO: \"I'm bankrupt because of you\". \"You're raising the standards, and you're dropping the prices,\" said Kamel. \"People are not trusting you anymore. I lost $97,000 because of you. I'm bankrupt because of you.\" Kamel then added: \"You keep changing every day.\" In response, Kalanick said: \"Some people don't like to take responsibility for their own shit. They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck!\" Then he proceeded to slam the car door. 24 February 2017 Waymo is taking legal action against Otto, a self-driving vehicle company bought by Uber last year for $700m. Uber is being sued for stealing trade secrets and technology, according to the BBC. The lawsuit alleges that Anthony Levandowski, a former Waymo employee, took information from Waymo by 'downloading 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files' before moving on to cofound Otto. \"Our parent company Alphabet has long worked with Uber in many areas, and we didn't make this decision lightly,\" said Waymo in a blog post. 3 February 2017 Following heavy criticism of Uber's practices during recent anti-Trump protests, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has stepped down from Donald Trump's economic advisory council. Kalanick said that his participation was 'misinterpreted' as an endorsement of Trump's agenda. \"Earlier today I spoke briefly with the president about the immigration executive order and its issues for our community. \"I also let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,\" said Kalanick in an email to Uber employees obtained by the Guardian. 2 February 2017 After the protests against Trump's executive order banning refugees and nationals of seven Muslim countries last week, Uber was accused of trying to profit from the protest. This has led to over 200,000 people deleting their Uber accounts following the #DeleteUber boycott, according to a report from The New York Times. 14 December 2016 Uber's self-driving cars will pick up passengers in the San Francisco area today. This expansion of Uber's Pittsburg trial earlier this year involves each enabled Volvo SUV housing a safety driver and an Uber test engineer to take start manually driving the car when needed and monitor the smart technology. All passengers need to do is request an uberX using the standard consumer-facing mobile app. 13 December 2016 According to reports, Uber employees have been spying on celebrities and former partners. Uber staff used its 'God's View' feature to monitor the movements of \"high-profile politicians, celebrities and even personal acquaintances of Uber employees, including ex-boyfriends/girlfriends, and ex-spouses\", wrote Samuel Ward Spangenberg's, Uber's former forensic investigator. Earlier this year Spangenberg was fired from Uber over age discrimination. Uber told Reveal in a statement: \"we have hundreds of security and privacy experts working around the clock to protect our data. This includes enforcing to authorised employees solely for purposes of their job responsibilities, and all potential violations are quickly and thoroughly investigated.\" Uber also said that its \"God View\" tool no longer existed, instead opting for an internal tool called \"Heaven View\". 26 October 2016 Uber has joined forces with AB InBev to transport 50,000 bottles of Budweiser, in what is thought to be the world's first self-driving commercial delivery.  The truck transported the beer more than 120 miles with police vehicles in tow, with reports suggesting the truck driver was relaxing in the back sleeping cab.  16 September 2016 From today Uber will be collecting images of UK city streets, starting with London. According to the BBC, these images will be used to determine the best pick-up and drop-off points around the city with plans to expand mapping activities to Leeds, Manchester and Birmingham. This image data will most likely aid Uber's driverless cars ambitions. 14 September 2016 During an interview with Bloomberg last month, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick revealed that it will deploy around 100 'driverless cars' in Pittsburgh.  Each vehicle will be fitted with self-driving capabilities and be staffed by one engineer, designed to take control of the car if needed and a co-pilot to note its progress, with the addition of a computer to record trips and map their data. This move comes after Uber acquired Otto, a startup aiming to deliver autonomy to lorries and trucks. Numerous reports have suggested Uber may use these capabilities in its own driverless car plan, or potentially its own driverless lorry business. 18 August 2016 Uber is taking legal action against London's transport authority TFL over its plans to force Uber drivers to pass a written exam in English.  The legal battle centres on TFL's new rules for private hire drivers that require people from non-English speaking countries to take (and pass) a mandatory written English test costing PS200. In addition to this, Uber has taken issue with TfL's rule that drivers must be covered by commercial insurance during out-of-work hours. 29 June 2016 Uber has been operating in London since 2012 when it launched 90 cars in the capital. In the same year Uber rolled out services to Toronto and Sydney with a soft launch in Singapore taking place in early 2013.  19 November 2015 Uber has introduced a new feature which allows all of its users to switch between their personal and business profiles, so that business trips are charged straight back to the company. This will cut down on the need to keep receipts and file expense forms, but could also lead to some red faces if users forget to switch between accounts.  Read more here. The man in charge of Uber's international expansion is leaving the taxi-app company, following regulatory challenges in Europe. Neil Wass, the senior vice president for Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific will leave Uber at the end of the year, according to the Financial Times. 8 May 2015 Taxi-app Uber has bid for Nokia's Here mapping business in a bid to reduce its dependence on Google, reports suggest.

That safety provision is just one outlined in a bill that is designed to regulate ride-sharing companies without stifling them. Read more here.  21 April 2015 A court case that alleges Uber discriminates against blind passengers will be allowed to proceed despite an attempt by Uber to have it thrown out, a California judge ruled.  The lawsuit, which concerns several alleged incidents in which Uber drivers refused service to blind passengers with service animals, represents another battle over whether Uber should be governed by the sale rules that cover taxis, buses and other public transportation companies.

The San Francisco-headquartered company has expressed an interest in joining the newly-created, government-backed Sharing Economy UK (SEUK) trade body but there are a number of obstacles that need to be overcome beforehand. Read more here. 19 March 2015 Taxi companies in California have sued Uber Technologies in a federal court, charging the ride-hailing smartphone app company with misleading advertising regarding the safety of its rides. Uber has made false and misleading advertisements regarding the safety of rides on its UberX platform, and criticised the safety of taxi rides offered by the taxi companies, the 19 firms said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco division. Read more here.  11 March 2015 The two companies want to classify their drivers as contractors rather than employees, which means they are not subject to employment protection law. In separate cases, two federal judges said the status of the companies' drivers will need to be decided by juries. If the drivers are considered employees, they could be entitled to minimum wages and any tips that customers pay, as well as other benefits. In that sense, the case is seen as a legal test that could affect other companies in the \"sharing economy.\" Read more here.  4 March 2015 Uber has bought mapping and location company deCarta in a bid to both improve its driver performance and develop new services. California-based DeCarta  holds a variety of data pertaining to mapping, local search and turn-by-turn navigation. Its global location based services were used by Google Maps (2005-2008) and are used today by GM OnStar, Ford Sync, Samsung, Inrix, Blackberry and over 25 mobile operators worldwide.

Ryan Graves, who five years ago reputedly replied \"hire me :)\" to a tweet about a job with an unknown startup, is now worth $1.4bn. Nice money if you can get it, but old new technology money dominates the rankings....

The ride-hailing service is teaming up with Starwood Hotels & Resorts to boost the use of its app among the well-traveled crowd. Through the partnership, members of Starwood's guest loyalty program can link their accounts with Uber accounts and earn Starwood credits whenever they take an Uber ride. They'll earn more credits if they take the ride while staying in one of the hotel company's 1,200 properties in 100 countries.

The latest expansion brings the total amount of money Uber raised from the funding round to $2.8 billion. The extra cash injection doesn't increase Uber's valuation, which is still $40 billion. Read more here.  3 February 2015 Google has already invested at least $258 million into Uber but there are a few reasons why a complete buyout makes perfect sense. The companies are heading in some of the same directions. Both Uber and Google are now working on driverless car technology and transportation and delivery services. Uber announced the creation of the \"Uber Advanced Technologies Centre\" in Pittsburgh through a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, which will focus on long-term technology in the areas of mapping, vehicle safety and \"autonomy technology.\" Were Google to acquire Uber, it might head off a possible confrontation between the companies as both push deeper into developing similar services. Read more here.   3 February 2015 Uber will open a technology centre near the Carnegie Mellon University to help put driverless cars on the road. The research team, based near the Carnegie Mellon campus in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will focus on mapping, car safety technology and driverless robotics.

Read more here.   19 January 2015 Can Uber still be classed as a startup if CEO Travis Kalanick successfully creates 50,000 jobs across Europe this year? The company believes it can, but others aren't so sure.  Many of the world's largest technology companies, including Google and Facebook, still consider themselves to be startups in one sense or another. Indeed, they see being a startup as more of a state of mentality as opposed to how old the company is, how large its revenues are or how many staff it employs.  When asked if Uber is still a startup, a spokesperson for the company said: \"I have not heard otherwise.\" Read more here.  13 January 2015  Boston city officials will be the first to dip their fingers into Uber's pot of data, under new plans laid out by the mobile car-summoning service. The effort, Uber says, is geared toward city planning in areas that include managing urban growth as well as improving traffic flows and congestion. By seeing how residents travel across a city, for instance, municipalities might have better information for creating or reducing parking zones, Uber says. Uber's data would add to the trip records from traditional taxi and other car service providers that local regulators already receive.

The extent of the controversies has made it difficult for some people to keep up, but data analysts at Silk have now created a number of visualisations depicting each of Uber's regulatory conflicts around the world. Read more here.  7 January 2015 Uber has expanded its driver perks programme from the US to the UK as part of an effort to sign up more taxi drivers to its service. Read more here.  6 January 2015 Uber is expanding aggressively worldwide but it is clearly chasing some markets more than others. Data released at the end of last year by data analysis firm Silk suggests that Uber is particularly keen on growing its operations in Asia. Uber wants to recruit 144 non-drivers in Asia, 81 in Europe, 29 in South America, 28 in Oceania, 17 in Africa and six in the Middle East, according to data sent to Techworld at the end of December. In the UK, Uber is recruiting for 13 positions, with seven of those falling under operations, two under local marketing and support and two under public policy and communication. There are no engineering positions being advertised in the UK, despite the well-established engineering communities around clusters like London's Silicon Roundabout and Cambridge.

      "content": "The UK fintech sector must concentrate on Asian markets and nurturing homegrown talent if it is to maintain its position as a global leader for innovative fintech companies post-Brexit, according to the chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond. Speaking at the inaugural International Fintech Conference today at Old Billingsgate in London, the chancellor said: \"We cannot rest on our laurels, we must constantly move onward to remain the best place in the world to start and grow a tech business. We can't remain the number one place for fintech and the other technologies of the fourth industrial revolution by simply relying on our ingenuity, talent and openness, we have to go out and get the business.\"  Hammond identified the UK's time zone, talent, entrepreneurs, markets and the overarching regulatory and tax environment as being responsible for positioning the UK as the global fintech capital. He said the fintech sector must continue to \"strive and graft and fight to seize opportunities\", particularly in the Asian market, if it is to maintain this position after Brexit. The government has already established fintech bridges with India, China, Korea and Singapore to help UK scale ups to expand into Asian markets. \"If the UK is going to make the most of the freedoms it will have after leaving the European Union we have to build trade links with the fast-growing economies of Asia,\" Hammond said. Access to the best talent from overseas is a key concern for the fintech sector post-Brexit. The chancellor attempted to calm these worries, while also reiterating a protectionist stance in regards to increasingly turning to British workers. He said: \"While we need to continue to attract the brightest and the best from around the world to these shores, we must also do better at nurturing and developing the home-grown talent to drive our economy forward in the future.\"  This includes the chancellor's Spring Budget pledge to fund new 'T-Levels' for 16-19 year olds. This will ensure, according to Hammond, that \"we are producing the people with the skills and the aptitude to become the next wave of innovators, entrepreneurs and investors.\" How this will play out is yet to be seen, but there is certainly cause for concern. With rollbacks of the H-1B visas -  so important to high-skilled tech workers - already occurring in the USA and Britain's home secretary Amber Rudd confirming that free movement of labour would come to an end with Brexit, the tech startup sector is keen to see the government clarify its position over who it can and cannot hire in the future. Taavet Hinrikus, CEO at six-year-old London fintech TransferWise, voiced the concerns of many startup founders when he took to the stage. An Estonian immigrant founder, Hinrikus employs a high number of workers originally from outside of the UK at its 100-strong office in Shoreditch. He believes that whether talent is \"home-grown or immigrants doesn't really matter, we just need the best talent.\" \"When we talk about home-grown people we need to instill a more entrepreneurial attitude, as well as development and engineering skills,\" Hinrikus said. \"When it comes to immigrants we need it to be easy to import talent, and make them feel happy and welcome. If London wants to cement its position as the fintech capital of the world the UK needs to take decisive action pretty quickly.\"  Hinrikus reiterated that although he believes London was the best place to found a fintech company in 2011, \"if I was setting up TransferWise today I probably would not choose London.\" He went on to talk about the ways other major technology and financial hubs, namely New York, Singapore, Paris, and Berlin, are already copying the UK blueprint for helping fintech companies to thrive, and how post-Brexit, these hubs will only become more attractive to new companies. \"Over the last couple of years we have seen many other governments around the world look at the UK for inspiration when it comes to fintech,\" he said. \"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and other countries are looking to the UK and what the regulators are doing here and copying what Britain has done. They are looking at opening up access to faster payments, fintech accelerators, Project Innovate from the FCA; all of these things are being copied from Abu Dhabi to Korea, to Singapore.\" ",

      "content": "The UK faces a conundrum in the coming years. We have to cut carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050, yet our electricity demand is set to double by then. The Institution of Mechanical Engineers has predicted UK energy demand could outstrip supply within just a decade. While the energy market might be overshadowed by Brexit negotiations and global political turmoil, blackouts would inevitably plunge the UK into crisis.  But rather than being paralysed by fear, a handful of tech startups are getting to work. Their focus: ensuring we use the energy we generate a lot more efficiently.  An astonishing 54 percent of energy produced in the UK is wasted, according to the Association for Decentralised Energy. So how do we bring that number down? One startup called Electron thinks it has found an elegant solution: blockchain. The benefits of blockchain in this space is that the distributed ledger technology allows all players to exist on one platform without handing power to any single entity. This creates transparency, provides a framework for collaboration and creates an immutable, time-stamped record of trades and switches between suppliers, according to Electron cofounder Joanna Hubbard. Electron has built two products on the Ethereum blockchain. The first is 'Demand Side Response' trading (which encourages sites to decrease energy use and sell excess energy back to the National Grid). The second is a service that makes it about 20 times faster for consumers to switch energy suppliers than current rates, thanks to a register Electron has built of all 53 million supply point meters in the UK (which measure our energy consumption). It would let customers switch in two or three hours, rather than the current weeks or months. \"Blockchain is a great way to unravel customers and companies in the energy space. We're really trying to sell the benefits it can bring,\" says Hubbard. \"The idea is to be able to access all suppliers on one blockchain. The tricky thing is we need all of the suppliers to use it. We have to have everyone buying in. The government has been very supportive though,\" she says. This reselling of energy - dubbed 'Demand Side Response' or DSR - is the most cost and carbon efficient way to balance the grid, according to Electron, letting us make best use of existing renewable capacity. And Electron is not the only UK tech company working on this problem. A more established player, Open Energi, was started a decade ago by a 'mad inventor' who had the idea that if every fridge in the UK could just be switched off for a few more minutes every day, it would save a vast amount of energy. This proved too hard to monetise, so the company refocused on the industrial sector - water, utilities and aggregate companies, plus retail (Sainsbury's is a client). \"If there's excess energy we pay the balance back to the National Grid...some of these big utilities companies can essentially become energy suppliers,\" technical director Michael Bironneau tells Techworld. Its technology, which consists of a small control panel used to increase or decrease electricity consumption, is installed at 500 sites across the UK. Say a chiller or air conditioner is designed to be between 18 and 20 degrees. If Open Energi detects there is surfeit of power on the grid, it can switch the chiller on. If there's less power, it can switch it off - helping to smooth out demand and save the client money (while also making our National Grid more efficient), he explains. This sort of DSR technology works for any sector with flexibility over energy consumption, Bironneau says. \"We're exploiting clients' flexibility on their behalf. It acts as a revenue share - we are paid by the National Grid, and we share percentage of that revenue with the client,\" he adds. While laudable, clearly these companies can't solve the UK's energy crisis alone. It's a problem that will need government leadership, plus funding and support. However what these startups do show is that technology will be a huge part of the solution to our energy conundrum. We just need the political will and imagination to solve it. ",

      "content": "Fintech is booming in the UK, with venture capitalists and the big banks circling companies that can transform financial services, and make everyone lots of money. According to research by Let's Talk Payments more than $5.5 billion (PS3.8bn) of investments were made in the fintech industry between July 2015 and January 2016 alone. Here are some of the hottest fintech startups in the UK right now, from young upstarts to more established names that are eyeing an IPO. Note: fintech can be a nebulous term in the world of startups but for the sake of this list we are defining a fintech startup as a company that is using technology to help people and businesses manage their finances. With barriers to entry coming down fast startup, digital-only banks are starting to get their licences. Atom is one of the first, receiving its licence in June 2015 and launching services through its mobile app in April 2016.  Based in Durham, Atom Bank is marketing itself to young, internet savvy users tired of traditional banks. The website, branding and marketing is both cuddly and slick. Atom Bank started providing two year fixed rate residential mortgages through selected independent advisers in December 2016, joining its two Fixed Saver accounts and SME business lending product. Customers can track any changes to their mortgage progress after receiving a decision in principle (DIP) through the Atom app. Current accounts are due to be added later this year. The bank was founded by Anthony Thomson who co-founded Metro Bank and the CEO is Mark Mullen, formerly of First Direct, so there is banking pedigree at the top level of Atom Bank. Atom Bank has raised an eye popping PS234 million in capital so far, including a reported PS100m venture round in February 2017. Existing investors include hedge fund Toscafund, Neil Woodford, and Spanish bank BBVA. Digital challenger bank Monzo (the challenger bank officially changed its name from Mondo in August 2016 following an undisclosed legal challenge) is building its banking software from the ground up so that customers will have a current account that lives on your smartphone. This will include transparent, real-time information about your money, geolocated transactions, peer-to-peer transactions and historic data on your spending with specific retailers. Monzo gained its full, unrestricted banking licence from UK regulators in February 2017. This means the now-official bank can hold customer money and offer products like current accounts. CEO and former GoCardless co-founder Tom Blomfield wrote in a blog post last year: \"We're tired of hidden fees and charges, endless paper forms, and nothing quite working in the way we'd expect. So we're trying to build a bank that we'd want for ourselves, our friends, and our families.\" Monzo raised PS19.5 million in February 2017, led by Thrive Capital. Other investors included Orange Digital Ventures and Passion Capital, who already invested PS13 million in the startup bank. Monzo is also seeking a further PS2.5 million crowdfunding round through Crowdcube (also on this list) after raising PS1 million in 96 seconds on the platform in March 2016. You can keep up to date with what Monzo is up to through its product roadmap, which is a publicly available Trello board. While working for Skype in London, Taavet Hinrikus grew tired of paying fees when transferring money back to Estonia to pay his mortgage. Along with Kristo Kaarman he launched TransferWise in 2011 as a peer-to-peer money transfer platform which would save people and business owners paying hidden bank fees and inflated exchange rates when transferring money into different currencies. The easy to use online platform lets you convert currency using a calculator tool which shows transparent pricing on the exchange rate and the TransferWise will charge, which is typically 0.5 percent for GBP transfers, as well as how much they think this is saving you. TransferWise is UK Financial Conduct Authority authorised and attained unicorn status in May. The company was valued at $1.1 billion following an additional $26 million (PS17.7m) funding round led by Scottish asset manager Baillie Gifford and existing investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Richard Branson, Peter Thiel, and Max Levchin. Former CEO Nick Hungerford founded Nutmeg to make investments accessible as an online platform. Nutmeg acts as an online wealth manager from as little starting capital as PS500 and charges a management fee of 0.3 percent to 0.95 percent compared to a UK active fund average of 1.58 percent.  When you register you tell the platform what you are saving for and how much risk you want to take before being presented with a portfolio that you can check in on 24/7. The investment decisions are made by the Nutmeg team on your behalf, no algorithms. You can withdraw your money whenever you want with no exit fees. All the hallmarks of a good fintech company are there: an user-friendly online interface, transparent pricing and a mission to bring down barriers. Nutmeg has raised PS71 million to date, including a PS12 million round in January led by Asian bank Taipei Fubon. Other investors include Schroders, Balderton Capital, Pentech, Armada Investment Group and Nigel Wray. Founded by Oxford graduates Matt Robinson and Hiroki Takeuchi, GoCardless uses technology to process business to business payments and direct debits quicker than traditional providers. The technology brings down barriers for small businesses to process direct debits by aggregating payments, and fees are kept low at 1 percent per transaction which is capped at PS2. Customers can process payments using one of three tools: an online dashboard, account software partnerships or as an integration via an API. Customers can't accept credit card or instant payments via the platform though and the system is limited to the UK and Europe as the company continues to grow. GoCardless raised $25 million (PS20 million) in funding so far, including a $13 million round in March 2016 led by new investor Notion Capital, with participation from existing backers Balderton Capital, Accel Partners, and Passion Capital. Revolut started life as a mobile wallet app to help customers avoid fees when taking out money abroad. Once signed up users get a physical MasterCard. You top the card up from your debit account and when you make purchases abroad the card exchanges the money into the local currency so that you don't get hit with any fees. Customers can also easily send money to friends through popular channels like WhatsApp. Even though it doesn't have a banking licence the startup launched its own version of a current account in February 2017, so UK customers can get a personal international bank account number (IBAN) through the app. This means customers can transfer money from an existing bank account and route their salary directly into Revolut, but not direct debits. The app also added spending categorisation, bill splitting, remote card freeze and a chatbot to handle support requests. It followed this up with the launch of a premium service in March 2017, allowing customers to spend, transfer and exchange unlimited amounts of money in 23 currencies without any fees for PS6.99 a month. Revolut has raised around PS20 million to date from venture funds like Balderton Capital, Index Ventures, Point Nine, Venrex, along with angel investors and crowdfunding. This includes a PS6.75 million round in July 2016. Azimo is a mobile money transfer startup in the vein of WorldRemit or TransferWise with a focus on migrants wanting to send money home at up to 90 percent less than traditional remittance services like major banks and Western Union. App users can also request, send and receive cash internationally using just a mobile phone number. Azimo has raised a total of $46 million (PS37 million) so far, including a venture round of $15 million (PS12 million) from Japanese ecommerce company Rakuten in May 2016. ClearBank is the UK's first new clearing bank in more than 250 years. Launched by Nick Ogden, formerly of Worldpay, ClearBank is a little different to most fintech companies in that it is not for consumers. Instead, ClearBank provides access to the primary UK payments and card issuing systems, like Faster Payments and SWIFT, for new entrants to the financial services industry to get started quickly and easily. The startup will be using Microsoft cloud technology through two data centres, which it hopes will give it greater agility, transparency and the ability to charge lower fees than the big four clearing banks, which are laden with legacy technology. ClearBank services are due to be generally available by Autumn 2017. Ogden himself is worth north of PS40 million and the startup has been backed by John Risley, a Canadian entrepreneur, and Petr Kellner, who founded the PPF investment fund. London-based fintech startup iwoca (instant working capital) gives small business fast and flexible access to capital, without the upfront fees, lengthy forms and long-term commitments traditionally associated with business credit. The founding team consists of CTO James Dear, who holds a PhD in theoretical physics from Kings College London, and CEO and ex-Goldman Sachs trader Christoph Rieche. The startup has already lent PS200 million to small businesses.- iwoca has raised $59 million million to small businesses. The secret sauce of iwoca is its risk model, which uses big data techniques to asses small businesses' trading data to make a quick, informed assessment of risk and what credit limit they are subsequently willing to give, ranging from one month's revenue to PS100,000. There are no upfront fees, iwoca charges a basic interest rate starting at two percent and increasing the longer you take to pay. iwoca has raised $59 million (PS47 million) in funding so far, including a $20 million (PS15 million) Series B round led by CommerzVentures, Acton Capital Partners and German VC firm Redline Capital. Tide is a fintech startup focusing on business customers. Business banking is infamously antiquated and time consuming, so Tide has created a set of tools to try and help small business owners with their banking. Customers can get started straight from their mobile by scanning an ID and will be sent a MasterCard to use for business transactions. Tide also provides a set of digital tools to help simplify some of the more time-consuming aspects of business banking. This includes automated bookkeeping, expense tracking with the ability to attach notes, incomes and photos to each transaction, and automated invoice scanning. Your money will be held by Barclays but it won't be re-invested by the bank. Tide also charges lower fees than normal business accounts, with no account or card purchase fees, 20p per transfer and PS1 per ATM withdrawal. Tide raised a seed round of $2 million (PS1.6 million) in July 2016 from LocalGlobe, Passion Capital and some angel investors. Receipt Bank looks to solve a tedious business problem: bookkeeping. Instead of accountants having to receive invoices and manually input the information into an Excel spreadsheet, the cloud-based software automatically extracts the data into the platform and delivers downloadable spreadsheets, or even integrates with your existing cloud based accounting software, saving accountants and small businesses time and effort. All you have to do is get clients to send their invoices and expense claims into the Receipt Bank email address provided when you register. Receipt Bank raised PS3.1 million from Silicon Valley Bank in January 2017, with the money earmarked for expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. This follows a $10 million (PS7 million) Series A funding round led by Kennet Partners in February the year before. SETL is a payment and settlements infrastructure based on blockchain technology based out of London and an engineering centre in Ipswich. The startup has a general purpose blockchain solution for financial services companies looking for immutable payments and settlements called OpenCSD, and has already helped clients like Deloitte - which has invested in the startup - with an ID system based on blockchain. In the company's words: \"The SETL system will enable market participants to move cash and assets directly between each other, facilitating the immediate and final settlement of market transactions. The SETL system maintains a permissioned, distributed ledger of ownership and transaction records, simplifying the process of matching, settlement, custody, registration and transaction reporting.\" SETL has raised around PS30 million in funding so far. dopay has built a cloud-based payroll platform which allows employers to pay people who don't have a bank account (two billion people worldwide according to the startup) without having to deal in cash. Founded by Dutch serial entrepreneur Frans van Eersel in 2013, dopay works out of the Level39 accelerator in London's Canary Wharf. The highly-automated platform also simplifies payroll processes for finance departments, like calculating salaries, emailing payroll slips and submitting government forms. Employees can get their salary paid into a dopay account, which comes with a pre-paid Visa card to use at ATMs, in-store or online, as well as an app for managing their finances on their phone. The company has raised $2.4 million (PS1.8 million) in a pre-series A funding round led by Techstars Ventures and Force Over Mass Capital in January 2016. Trussle was founded in 2015 by Ishaan Malhi, a former real estate and structured finance analyst at Bank Of America Merrill Lynch, and Jonathan Galore, an experienced fintech entrepreneur, the online mortgage advisor has been regulated by the FCA and already claims to manage nearly PS500 million of mortgages. With Trussle you can apply for a mortgage online in less than five minutes, with no paperwork involved. Trussle aggregates mortgage products via an API feed provided by a specialist company, and works with the mortgage advisors bureau (MAB), giving them access to roughly 11,000 deals from 90 lenders in the UK market. Read more: Meet Trussle, the one-year-old startup taking on the UK mortgage industry Trussle has also built a mortgage tracking service, built on the aforementioned API, which will automatically compare a customers existing mortgage with alternatives in the market on the back end and email you if there is a better deal available. Trussle has been backed to the tune of one million pounds by angel investors, LocalGlobe and Seedcamp. Property search giant Zoopla announced a strategic partnership with Trussle in February. Trussle raised PS4.5 million in funding in January 2017 led by Orange Growth Capital and including investment from existing investors LocalGlobe, Seedcamp and property portal Zoopla, who combined for a PS1.1million seed round in February 2016 alongside angel investors Ed Wray and Ian Hogarth. Chip is an automated savings app which links up with your current account. The Chip algorithm calculates how much you can afford to save and transfer it to a Chip savings account - held with Barclays - adjusting all the time depending on spending habits. Users simply have to download the iOS or Android app and grant Chip read-only access to their online banking through an encrypted API. Chip currently works with Barclays, HSBC, Santander, Lloyds, NatWest, Nationwide, RBS, TSB, Halifax, First Direct, Co-operative Bank and Metro Bank. The mobile savings app is a busy space, with rivals like the Facebook messenger app Plum and Moneybox offering alternatives, but Chip's founder Simon Rabin - who created and sold the roaming charge-avoiding app Roamer - says that savings are just the start, with other financial services in its sights. Curve allows you to combine all of your bank cards under a single app and card. Not only does this make your wallet lighter but you can track all of your transactions in one place, in real time. How does it work? Just take a picture of your cards (current account, credit card: regardless of which country that account is based in) and Curve pulls them together into an Apple Pay style display. You then set a default card using the app, allowing you to use your Curve card for chip and PIN, contactless, cash withdrawals or mobile payments, all under a single PIN. The Curve card is build on MasterCard rails, meaning it is accepted anywhere MasterCard is and comes with all the same security, with the added assurance that your actual cards are safely left at home. You also won't get charged when using Curve abroad, regardless of which card you use or which currency you are dealing in. All transaction data is then pulled together in the Curve app. You will get a notification once a payment is made and you can tag and categorise payments on the platform to get a simple view of your finances. You will still be charged for ATM withdrawals when abroad though (PS2) and Curve charges one percent on top of the MasterCard wholesale foreign exchange rate. Update 25/05/2016: Curve has announced that it no longer supports American Express transactions. A tweet from the American credit card company's UK account stated: \"We don't feel confident in the support/service in place. We remain open to discussion with curve [sic] if we can work in the future.\" One of the key selling points for Curve was being able to use your AmEx in locations where it normally wasn't accepted and still collect reward points. Curve costs PS35 to get an account set up and a card shipped out to you, with no further fees. Curve completed a $2 million (PS1.4m) seed round in December, led by Taavet Hinrikus of TransferWise, Ricky Knox of Tandem bank, Ed Wray of Betfair and former members of the Google Wallet team. Cardiff-based fintech startup Wealthify launched in the UK in April with its hybrid investment platform, combining humans and algorithms to offer investment portfolios with lower barriers to entry. CEO Richard Theo told Techworld.com: \"We're trying to democratise investing to make it accessible with a much lower starting point at PS250 [Nutmeg starts at PS500] and the whole simplicity of design is to target the mass market.\" Wealthify will ask you to select a risk proposition, which is presented in plain language. This is then backed up by a suitability test to validate their own logic on risk models, \"so a safety net to make sure people aren't going in the wrong direction,\" says Theo. Then Wealthify will invest in a range of asset classes, like Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), with the algorithms defining which asset classes to invest in and when depending on market information and your risk profile. According to Theo, due to regulatory reasons Wealthify cannot define the returns (although Nutmeg does with its ISA proposition) but: \"Historical stock market trends over the last five years and over the MCIS stock market index shows 8.2% per year.\" This varies dependent on risk. Wealthify has been funded by it's co-founders so far and will be seeking additional funding now that it has launched. Theo said: \"There is no shortage of appetite for investing, no question, but crowdfunding could be good for the advocacy reason.\" DueDil is the UK's equivalent to Bloomberg business when it comes to getting information on companies, but with more detail. The platform pulls together data from thousands of sources including company websites, financial filings, news reports, registry data, trademarks, and country court judgments. This information is then searchable by company and presented in on a user friendly platform. This helps companies do their due diligence (hence the name) and avoid risks by identifying the right companies to sell to, get insights into their business, and make a sale. Since 2011 DueDil has raised nearly $30m (PS20.6m) from investors including Oak Investment Partners, Passion Capital and Notion Capital. and includes customers like Royal Mail, Stripe and Kuoni. Everyone has heard of Kickstarter, a peer-to-peer platform that allows people to raise funds for projects via donations from the general public. Crowdcube takes this idea and applies it to investing in actual businesses. Users of Crowdcube can play venture capitalist but on their financial terms by investing in startups, early stage and growth businesses and receive equity, debt and investment fund options in return. Since 2011 the platform has funded companies to the tune of PS138m already via 245,690 registered investors, including tech startups like Rentify and Luxtripper. Crowdcube itself has raised PS6 million from stockbroker Numis, Draper Esprit and Balderton Capital. Funding Circle's peer-to-peer platform lets savers invest in small UK businesses and earn an estimated return of 7.1 percent, while the businesses themselves get access to loans of between PS5,000-PS1 million without having to deal with banks. On December 29, 2015 Funding Circle passed the PS1bn mark in terms of funding, coming from 46,865 investors. The UK government backed the startup in February 2014 with a PS40m investment from the British government to fund small businesses through the Funding Circle platform. Funding Circle landed in the top five of KPMG's fintech 100 list, the highest ranked UK startup.  Bud is an app which helps customers bundle all of their financial services into a single digital wallet to help keep tabs on all transactions and cut through the noise. Bud plans to launch a 'marketplace' where you can compare different available products this year, but instead of having to do the heavy lifting yourself Bud will include algorithms for smarter matching of customers and products. It is also looking to incorporate an 'intelligent assistant' feature into the app.  Bud has been self-funded to this point but plans to raise its first round of capital in 2017. ",

      "content": "Advice on the best tablets for startups and entrepreneurs. It's iPad vs Android vs Surface Pro for the title of best tablet for business. Let's face it, you are likely to buy an iPad. But if you are trying to start or grow a business, your choice of personal tech is critically important. You want something that is portable and powerful and able to support you in working wherever you are. But you also need something that looks the part without breaking the bank. Here is our guide to the best tablet for startups and entrepreneurs.  The most popular individual brand of tablet, Apple's iPad is slick and simple to use. Secure and with the best app support on the market. It's not cheap though, and you will need an adaptor for most projectors, which is an issue when presenting. We recommend the iPad Pro 9.7-inch. It's more affordable than the 12.9-inch model and feels more like a tablet for both work and play due to it's smaller screen and ultra portability. However, if you'll be using it for mostly work, the 9.7 Smart Keyboard is on the small side of detachable keyboards. The iPad Pro will be at the top end of most people's budgets, coming in at between PS549 to PS1,029. If you definitely want to go with Apple, there is a slightly cheaper alternative. Simply called the iPad, Apple's newest release will set you back between PS339 and PS559 depending on the model and specs you choose.  You can get an Android tablet that is every bit as good as the Apple equivalent, and it will cost less. But you need to know what you are getting: the Android world is a very mixed bunch.  Android plus points include universal USB support, and the ease with which you can transfer from PC or Mac to Android tablet. App support remains patchy, however, and there is a minor security risk. Designed entirely by Google, the Pixel C is a great option for people wanting a tablet and keyboard attachment for long days at the office and for watching films or TV shows on the go, although it will set you back PS479.99. However, when it comes to Android tablets, the Sony Experia Z4 shouldn't be overlooked. The Z4 is a worthy rival to the iPad Air 2. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 is also a great choice for an Android tablet as it offers solid specs, a great screen and a lightweight design. This tablet comes in at around PS329. The latest Samsung tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, was released in March 2017. It has  an impressive display, the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 CPU and expandable storage of up to 256GB thanks to the inclusion of a microSD card slot. It's a pretty impressive tablet, and this is reflected in the price. It costs around PS599.99. Check out PC Advisor's Best tablets list to be sure you are getting what you need. Hands down one of the best tablets for business, Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 is a power PC in tablet form. No other tablet offers you full use of full Windows: any software you can run on a PC, you can run on Surface Pro. The keyboard cases are brilliant, too, meaning that the Surface Pro really is the tablet that can replace your laptop. For real. Downsides? It is - as you would expect - expensive.  Price points range between PS749 and PS1669. Depending on which specs and accessories you go for, this tablet would be a huge investment. But its impressive specs could make it all worth it. The Surface Pro 4 offers a crisp 2736x1824 screen resolution, up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage (although the 1TB model is not available in the UK just yet) and a 6th-generation Skylake Intel Core M3 processor, making it one powerful machine. However, you might want to hold off buying it as it is rumoured that the Surface Pro 5 could be released this summer.  You can dial down the price and get a Windows tablet from the likes of Dell or HP. Just be sure you know what you are getting. A cheaper Windows tablet may have a poor quality screen, anaemic performance and poor connectivity. Worst of all: it may have poor battery life. Always check the specs, read reviews, and seek advice before you buy. The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S is a good option for those wanting a relatively high spec tablet with detachable keyboard without the Apple price tag (although, it's not exactly cheap). Otherwise, the Chuwi Hi10 Pro and Microsoft Surface Pro 3 are all solid options at more attainable prices. The best convertible tablet/PC hybrids can be a good compromise between power and portability. The worst? Hopelessly hamstrung devices that are good at neither. And there are more of the latter than the former.  Typically convertibles are fat and heavy tablets with cramped keyboards attached. Unless you can really shell out, we suggest avoiding and getting a thin and light laptop.  However, if you are set on a hybrid machine, the Asus Transformer Book Flip and the Lenovo Yoga 900-131SK are good choices. ",

      "content": "Advice on the best smartphones for businesses, startups and entrepreneurs. (See also: Best tablets for business 2017.) Let's face it, lots of people will choose an iPhone. But you would be wrong to do so - both in terms of keeping down costs, and of getting the right tool for the job. You need a phone that can help you work on the move, but also need something that will allow you to work across multiple devices, and to secure your data. Reader, you need an Android phone or a BlackBerry that runs Android.  Here is our guide to the best smartphones for businesses, startups and entrepreneurs. Apple's smartphones remain unsurpassed in terms of build quality. Unsurpassed, but not out on their own.  Some of Microsoft's Windows Phones and virtually all high-end Androids can match the iPhone's build quality, and most don't require a case to protect all that precious aluminium. Meanwhile, Apple's performance is pretty great, but not noticeably better than the best Android phones.  The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, will have some loyal Apple users jump at the chance of a bigger screen and the newest iPhone on the market. However, going for a slightly older version could save you money and make sure you don't lose out on features.  So if you're really set on getting an iPhone, you could save yourself a bit of cash and go for the iPhone 6s Plus as it houses all the functionality of the iPhone 7 Plus but comes at a reduced price tag. Although, with Apple most likely releasing a new iPhone this year, you could hold of and go for the iPhone 7 which will probably reduce in price.  In March 2017, Apple released the iPhone 7 in partnership with RED, meaning some of the money from each purchase will go to helping those with AIDs and HIV. However, it is only available in 128GB or 256GB. Should you, then, plump for an Android? Quite possibly, but this is not without problems of its own. Android phones can be picked up relatively cheaply and if you go for a high-end model, you can get specs unrivalled by other manufacturers. However its open platform does mean that security can be an issue, something which you will see less of if you go for an iPhone. March 2017 marked the release of the Samsung Galaxy S8, which is rumoured to be the best phone to buy on the market, if you have a spare PS689 that is. And while the specs of the S8 aren't actually that dissimilar to its predecessor (which is fantastic), you will receive a better screen and access to Bixby, Samsung's version of Siri or Google Assistant.  Phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge still offer great displays, expandable storage, and compatibility with all USB-powered peripherals. And because it is Android, your device will be customisable, and compatible with Google Docs, as well as all the other Google tools you use such as Analytics, or Google Drive. So then, there is always the BlackBerry. Contrary to popular belief the old BlackBerry is still alive and kicking out new phones. And the two most recent ones - the BlackBerry Classic and BlackBerry Passport - are really good. For a BlackBerry. BlackBerry phones are good only for business: hardware keyboards, enterprise level security and fleet management, email, spreadsheets. The dull stuff. If that is good for you, good for you. Interestingly, Blackberry is releasing phones that run Android, so you can take full advantage of Blackberry's security features and Androids top-notch specs.  We like the DTEK60, it offers all the best bits of Android within the secure parameters of Blackberry. It hosts the Blackberry Hub, which is a great productivity app, ideal for both business users and traditional Blackberry fans. Which brings us to the unloved Windows Phone. Unloved, but possibly perfect for small businesses - especially if you use Windows 10, Office 365, Skype, and so on. And while it lacks the app support of Android or iPhone, it still has support for all the big apps. The media story isn't much to write home about, and the phones themselves are far from sexy. But they work. And Windows 10 for mobile offers good compatibility with other Microsoft software, great security features, and the ability for a sys admin to look after a fleet from anywhere.  Windows Phone have obvious downsides. Its OS uptake is trailing behind the others listed and the amount of apps available is embarrassingly small, but with the initial release of Windows 10 for mobile, this could all change. Particularly for business users. When opting for a Windows Phone, a good choice is the Microsoft Lumia 950. Users can purchase a Windows Continuum and connect their phone to a monitor, which will run full Windows without the need for a PC. Pretty cool.  Even better is the HP Elite x3 which offers an exceptional battery life, solid specs and a great user experience, although it will set you back PS700 plus. ",

      "content": "The beginning of 2017 has been a horror show for the world's most valuable startup -- the ride-hailing app Uber -- and its CEO Travis Kalanick. Scandals have ranged from the external -- tax, regulatory and driver-related scandals -- to more recent internal issues regarding Kalanick's leadership and company culture, including ties to Donald Trump's presidency, key executive departures, sexual harassment lawsuits and viral videos.  Experienced tech journalist Matt Rosoff, of CNBC Digital in San Francisco, put it best when he tweeted: \"I've been a tech journalist on and off for 21 years and I can't remember any company having a worse month news cycle-wise than Uber is now.\"  So, as users in their droves #DeleteUber, what are the alternatives for hailing a ride from your phone? In the UK there are a few options for booking a taxi if you want to support black cabs, avoid surge charging or simply stop funding a company with so many black marks against it. Further afield, Uber is competing with some increasingly savvy startups and has even conceded the fight in China by selling its business to rival Didi Chuxing last year.  Here are the best alternatives to Uber, both in the UK and abroad: The UK taxi-hailing app Hailo merged with fellow European taxi-hailing app MyTaxi -- which is owned by German automotive giant Daimler -- in 2016. This creates what MyTaxi describes as \"Europe's largest taxi app\", with 100,000 registered taxi drivers in over 50 cities across nine countries, including 17,000 black cabs in London, its only UK city at the time of writing. In practice the MyTaxi app is pretty similar to Uber in that you can get started quickly and order a taxi to your location and have it paid for using the app. The key difference is taxis are licensed and you won't get stung with surge pricing at times of high demand. In a very lightly veiled dig at Uber and other rivals, MyTaxi CEO Andrew Pinnington told Bloomberg Technology following the merger: \"Unlike some of the other services, we work with the authorities,\" he said. \"Our phrase we use is we're a constructive disruptor.\"  Uber has been battling with incumbent taxi companies, including London's black cabs, for years now, and although it introduced a taxi-hailing option for London black cabs, it removed the feature in March, with the company saying: \"Since we first launched UberTAXI, hundreds of black cab drivers have taken tens of thousands of trips through the Uber app. However, in recent months, those numbers have tailed off.\" This opens the door to companies specialising in linking up riders and black cabs, but the question is whether enough consumers care. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: Your uncle was a black cab driver Israeli startup Gett differentiates itself from Uber and Lyft by offering completely flat pricing, and works with licensed taxi drivers. Although it is admirable for companies like MyTaxi and Gett to not use surge pricing or unlicensed drivers this does have its competitive drawbacks. The hidden advantage of surge pricing is that it encourages more drivers to get into their cars at peak times in order to earn the extra money, meaning it is easier to get a cab using these services. MyTaxi and Gett facilitating normal taxis means these cars can dry up at peak times, as these drivers are more likely to be hailed down by people on the street.  Gett certainly hasn't hit the popularity or levels of brand familiarity that Uber has in the UK yet but it is a serious competitor and is the only other ride-hailing service that operates in UK cities other than London, with users able to use Gett in Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Glasgow, Leeds, Oxford, Cambridge, Reading, Slough, Milton Keynes, Brighton, Bristol, Bath, Cardiff, Portsmouth, Bournemouth, Leicester, Coventry, Sheffield, Nottingham, Bradford, Hull, and Newcastle. The company will also look to use the $300 million that Volkswagen Group invested in May 2016 to aid further expansion. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: That 3.2x surge back from Shoreditch last weekend was the final straw  The biggest minicab company in the UK has been working hard to keep up with changing consumer habits when it comes to ordering cars since Uber appeared on the scene. It has since made sweeping changes to its mobile app and online ordering capabilities. The Addison Lee app is now a handy fall back for when Uber is surging, or for booking airport transfers ahead of time, and is popular with corporate clients that want fixed pricing and support. For consumers, the app works in many of the same ways that consumers have become accustomed to in the age of ride-sharing, with no more calling a taxi dispatch office. The downside of Addison Lee is that it is not available outside of London and can be pretty expensive. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: It's raining and it's late and you are desperate London minicab aggregator Kabbee claims to be up to 65 percent cheaper than a black cab. It pools cars from more than 70 providers, giving users access to 10,000 London cabs. All drivers are licensed and minicab fleets with poor ratings get struck off from the service. The service is currently only available in London though. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: You are tight  The French carpooling startup is a bit different to the other alternatives on this list. Instead of hailing a ride, registered users of BlaBlaCar can carpool with people who are already making a journey, say back from London to university in Cardiff. The European startup has proved popular in its home market and has a sizeable UK pool of registered members, with thousands of rides available every day. BlaBlaCar raised $200m (PS129m) in a 2015 funding round that valued the company at EUR1.4bn. The investment was led by Insight Venture Partners and Lead Edge Capital. The startup has said that it does not plan on expanding to the USA where car ownership is higher and fuel prices lower than across Europe. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: You love talking to strangers   In the USA, Uber's biggest rival is Lyft. The two essentially offer identical services as far as the average consumer is concerned, however, Lyft tries to set itself apart with a more friendly, cuddly image. In terms of the core apps, there has been a fair amount of back and forth between Lyft and Uber. Both surge pricing in times of high demand and both added carpooling features within a day of one another in 2014. Lyft followed Uber's lead in allowing fare splitting the same year, after Uber launched the feature in 2013.  Lyft does have a differentiating feature for tipping drivers, but the company still doesn't recognise drivers as anything more than independent contractors, denying them worker protections and benefits. The two companies have frequently been embroiled in a war of words, with Lyft accusing Uber of ordering and cancelling rides and trying to recruit their drivers. Uber denied the claims. Lyft cofounders Logan Green and John Zimmer have been very keen to publicly take the moral high ground as of late, as Uber is enveloped by more and more scandals. 3/ We are donating $1,000,000 over the next four years to the ACLU to defend our constitution. https://t.co/0umGOlkhSx Why this is the Uber alternative for you: You have a social conscience and a liberal outlook If you are based in Southeast Asia you will know all about car-hailing service Grab, formerly GrabTaxi. Hugely popular in its native Malaysia and in various other countries across the region, like Vietnam, Indonesia and expat-heavy Singapore, where it is now headquartered. Today, Grab claims 710,000 drivers across 39 cities in six countries in Southeast Asia. It also claims 36 million downloads of its mobile apps. The startup is growing quickly, recently opening engineering centres in Vietnam and India. The app itself is pretty similar to Uber as it links up riders and cars quickly and easily. There are various tiers of the service, generally, a Taxi hailing option, Grab cars and Hitch for carpooling. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: You do a lot of business in Singapore Chinese company Didi Chuxing, or Didi for short, is the only ride-hailing app so far to strike a definitive blow to Uber. In August 2016 Uber gave up a multi-billion dollar fight with its Chinese rival by selling its local business to Didi for a 17.7 percent ownership stake in Didi and $1 billion in cash. The company has since garnered the nickname the Uber Slayer, and is set to dominate the enormous Chinese market from here on out. CEO Cheng Wei says that 80 percent of all licensed drivers of China's yellow striped taxis now use Didi to find passengers. Customers can use Didi to hail a car, taxi, rideshare or high-end private car. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: You live in China Russia's homegrown alternative to Uber is Yandex.Taxi, a company run by the country's biggest internet company, Yandex. Yandex.Taxi operates in 48 cities across five countries and reported some impressive figures for 2016: providing 16.2 million rides in December, up 460 percent year on year. Yandex.Taxi drivers are fully vetted by the company and must have private hire licenses. CEO Tigran Khudaverdyan said: \"I'm incredibly proud of the growth Yandex.Taxi has seen in 2016, we aggressively expanded our geographic reach and saw the number of rides increase 5.6 times from 2.9 million in December 2015 to 16.2 in December 2016.\" Why this is the Uber alternative for you: You don't trust American companies Uber has had a tough time in the Indian market, facing regulation and driver scandals, opening the door to local rival Ola to effectively create a duopoly in the market with an aggressive strategy of offering free rides in the aftermath. The Ola app allows you to book and pay for cars and the pricing is clear and transparent, a far cry from the old style of haggling over the price of a ride. Ola also surges pricing and has many tiers of cars and services, from rideshares to Lux services and even a commuter specific Shuttle product. Why this is the Uber alternative for you: Uber in India still scares you ",

      "content": "Property tech (proptech) has been on the rise recently as internet savvy buyers, comfortable with the likes of Uber and Airbnb, want an easier way to buy, sell and rent property without dealing with expensive and ineffective estate agents. Here's our pick of the bunch. We will start with the only company that has gone public on this list, Purplebricks. The online-only estate agent uses \"local advisors\" to try and smooth the buying and letting process out and can save money by not having a physical presence on the high street. Founder Michael Bruce explained the idea behind the company to Startups.co.uk: \"Using our local property experts on the ground and a unique online platform, Purplebricks allows people to oversee every aspect of their property transaction as it happens, at the touch of a button, rather than waiting for an estate agents office to open.\" What Purplebricks does differently is charge flat rates, which help transparency and, most importantly, saves consumers money. Purplebricks charges PS798 (up from PS599 pre-IPO) to sell your property (except in certain London postcodes where it is PS1,158), compared to the average rate of 1.8% of the property price traditionally charged. This leads to average savings of PS4,572 for sellers, according to Purplebricks. The fully-managed letting service is PS66 per month, with a flat fee of PS299 (PS199 pre-IPO) or PS599 in London, and Purplebricks provides a full set of 24/7 management tools. Local advisors offer support to sellors and lettors and will take photographs, create a floor plan, write a description and prepare the advert for online aggregators like Rightmove and Zoopla. Purplebricks listed at 100p a share at IPO on London's AIM exchange in December 2015, valuing the company at PS240.2 million (high street estate agents Foxtons, by comparison, has a market cap of PS537 million). Brother and sister Paul and Gemma Young founded and launched Settled in 2015 after Gemma left her job at Google. Settled is a platform that allows homeowners to cut out the middle man when selling a property, much like Airbnb but for sales.  Much like Purplebricks, property owners can pay Settled PS299, who will then visit your property, take photos and create a floor plan before placing adverts across all of the major portals (95% of all property searches in the UK are online, with Zoopla and Rightmove the dominant aggregators). You can arrange bookings remotely and Settled provide support all the way up to completion. Settled claims to save customers PS4,400 on average. Gemma Young, Settled's CEO, told Techworld: \"We're very focused on homes rather than houses, so sellers that love their homes are enabled to have real conversations\" with potential buyers. Young saw the opportunity arise from a system that doesn't put the consumer first, saying: \"People aren't that fond of estate agents as it happens, so it's a bit of a broken system with very little regulation and wildly different service levels.\" This is where Settled comes in, by offering a more personal, transparent service: \"There's lots of smoke and mirrors, and models built around a sale and volume of sales,\" says Young, \"generally one in three or four properties will fall through after an offer, and we are finding it extremely low, less than 0.5%.\" The startup moved into the Garage Soho incubator in 2015 as it looks to improve its brand awareness. Settled has completed its second round of seed funding (amount undisclosed) with the Garage Soho.  The newest startup on this list is Nested, a London startup which promises to help homeowners to sell their property in 90 days, or they will give you the money to make your next purchase interest-free. Nested was created by former GoCardless founder Matt Robinson, former Songkick CTO Phil Cowans and a former business consultant. Using algorithms built by Cowans Nested provides sellers with a property valuation within seconds and guarantees a minimum price from day one, promising to sell the house within 90 days or give them the money. Nested will review the quick valuation and organise an inspection before confirming a guaranteed offer and placing adverts on property portals like Zoopla and Rightmove. They even take care of the viewings.  In exchange for a guaranteed sale Nested charges a minimum fee of 1.8 percent once you close a sale. Nested will then take another twenty percent of any money that is made on the sale above the algorithmically decided value. Co-founder and CEO of Movebubble Aidan Rushby has one aim: putting the renter first. Anyone that has rented a property will know the familiar frustrations: trawling property aggregators to find the property, ringing the agent, being told there is already an offer, inflexibility. Movebubble's app ensures that properties are actually available, saving on that all too common feeling that your chasing ghosts. Movebubble started out with the lofty aim of cutting those pesky estate agents out of the process altogether, but, as many of the companies on this list have found out, inventory is key, and the agents are the gatekeepers. \"Originally when Movebubble was created we believed that renters don't want to deal with agents,\" Rushby told Techworld, \"the reality is they will rent the property from wherever it is. The way we look at it Movebubble is there for the renter, and the agent is there for the landlord.\" The app learns your preferences and tries to filter out undesirable properties the more you interact with it and helps filter out bad agents using an Airbnb style feedback loop. Movebubble is also trying to bring more transparency to the rental business, which is traditionally a black box, so how many times the property has been viewed and if there are actually offers in place will be integrated into the app. According to Rushby, Movebubble currently lists around 70% of all property stock (13,537 according to the demo version of the app I was shown) in London and this comes 95% through estate agents, with some larger landlords topping up the inventory. Currently Rushby is seeing the user base growth as quite slow, with just 30-40 downloads a day, with the majority of successful rentals being completed by fellow young tech professionals. For the time being Rushby is just concentrating on the product and building the user base, concluding: \"Movebubble is here to make the experience for the renter unbelievable so they go through it seamlessly, then we'll look at how to monetise that.\" Movebubble rasied a PS1.2 million round of venture capital funding in February 2016, bringing total funding up to PS2.1 million. Rentify works just with private landlords looking to rent out their property. The company operates on a hybrid platform, cutting out the expensive high street agents in favour of a 24/7 help desk and ARLA certified \"property specialists\". Founder George Spencer explained the business to Wired.co.uk as: \"We are a technology-enabled letting agent, in the same way as Amazon is a technology-enabled bookstore.\" Rentify allows landlords to post an advert, perform credit checks and issue a tenancy agreement all online. Landlords can also manage tenants through the platform including deposit protection, online inventory and rent processing, with 24-hour customer care on hand. They take a 4% commission on a no rent, no fee basis, as opposed to a high street agent like Foxtons which tends to take around 15%. The company claims to have 200,000 independent landlords signed up to the service. At first glance Rentify is far more focused on getting landlords on board than a base of renters at this time, with consumers only able to request details on properties and no specific benefits listed on the site at the time of writing. The company does claim to advertise 1,450 properties each month, but doesn't state how many are let out. Rentify has raised more than PS8 million to date, including a PS1.3 million crowd funding round through Crowdcube.  Taking a slightly different approach to the rest of the startups on this list, Appear Here concentrates on the retail sector, specifically short term rentals and pop-ups, by linking retailers with landlords to find the best spaces available. Appear Here works with both landlords that are looking to find short-term tenants for their space (for example Boxpark, Westfield or market stalls) and brands/retailers that are looking for the perfect space to display out of (such as Apple, Dior or even artists like Jamie XX). Getting established brands to use the platform gave Appear Here a solid portfolio of case studies to show off, and this helped reach the tipping point of convincing landlords to list their space. Founder Ross Bailey took an interesting approach to spending his first batch of seed funding. At just 22 years old and straight out of a School Of Communication Arts post-grad he spent most of the cash on \"editorial, copywriters, designers.\" When investors questioned his prioritising of aesthetics over the technology he explained: \"We would go to landlords and they would say: \"This doesn't happen online\" and were just really against everything we were doing.\" So he needed a website that they would want to be seen on, only then could he secure the required inventory to match the retailer demand he knew existed. Formerly there just wasn't a platform for flexible use lettings, according to Bailey, with lets taking six months on average to close. Bailey claims that on Appear Here that is down to 48 hours, as they provide all in one pricing (rent, rates, utilities and transaction fees) as well as an online payment platform and standardised legal approval through their partnership with Forsters LLP. Bailey is now working on pushing Appear Here out into new \"retail cities\" in 2016 and finding ways to leverage their unique data. \"We are the only ones out there with an understanding of where every brand wants to be, what they will spend, what the next street is, so we have a huge ability to aggregate that data and understand really interesting things around the market,\" says Bailey. Appear Here received PS5.8 million in Series A funding led by Balderton Capital in November 2014, which will be spent on international expansion into \"key retail cities\" and expanding its customer service capability. Another proptech startup focusing on more commercial property is Virtual Commercial. Former commercial property manager Andrew Vertes set out to become the \"UK's first online commercial estate agent.\" Vertes actually describes Virtual Commercial as \"Purplebricks for commercial property\" as he saw an industry resistant to technology. \"Property, especially commercial property, is a dinosaur. It is considered an advantage if you can send an email really,\" he told Techworld. For those not well versed in commercial property management the incumbent model looks a bit like this, according to Vertes: \"You get an instruction, you market it, secure a tenant. The agent gets a fee on completion, some marketing costs upfront and a percentage of the value on the premium.\" This works out as roughly 10 percent of annual rent, two percent of freehold sales and a raft of additional fees. Virtual Commercial on the other hand sets a flat fee, hence the Purplebricks comparison, starting at PS999 for a starter pack and access to the online platform. The average London agent fee, according to Vertes, is closer to PS5,000. The starter pack consists of 12 months of advertising and a 4x3 ft Virtual Commercial board to fix to your property. The platform allows property owners to manage all leads and enquiries. Phone queries are answered by the Virtual Commercial 24/7 freephone service. All leads are held in one place, where you can manage viewings, track progress and add notes. Virtual Commercial also provides training, support and templates for the relevant paperwork and referencing processes so that property owners can become their own agent. Virtual Commercial has bootstrapped its funding to launch this year and outsourced its developers to build the platform, so it is still early days. However, if they can carve out a niche in the very lucrative commercial property market they could benefit from taking this approach and being first to market. The main question will be if property owners see a PS4,000 saving as worth the extra work of becoming their own agent. London startup Goodlord is looking improve the ways that renters, estate agents and landlords transact through a suite of tools on its cloud-based technology platform. Goodlord wants to modernise a number of the stages along the chain of a renting a property, starting with putting down money, signing contracts and referencing, all processes that still tend to need to be done in branch and on paper. This meant building its own e-signing capability for contracts and using Stripe and GoCardless to facilitate payments. In theory this could mean rental properties coming off the market even faster than before as paperwork and deposits could all be done at the viewing itself on an iPad. The startup is currently targeting estate agencies as customers for the platform, counting more than 300 already and claiming to save them between 50-75 percent in admin time and IT spend as a result.  Goodlord raised a PS7.2 million round earlier this year, bringing total funding to nearly PS10 million. One of the younger companies on this list, Propoly (formerly Nanoget) is essentially a messaging service that allows landlords and tenants to communicate without having to go through an agent when logging issues, reporting problems and requesting services like handymen or plumbers. London-based startup Proply moved into the Pi Labs at London's Second Home office space in 2015 ahead of a 2016 product launch, and subsequent rebrand. It has only received unspecified seed funding at this point. Chief financial officer Ben Shemie said that it should be easier to attract customers at the lower end of the market. Shemie doesn't go along with the common line of thought in this sector, that agents are anathema, though: \"At the top end, yeah, agents are good at what they do, because they get the customer to pay more, so sellers obviously like that.\" ",

      "content": "There was a dose of realism last night as a cross section of the London technology scene agreed that the mandatory opening up of customer's financial data via APIs in January 2018 - otherwise known as open banking - may not be the instant revolution that regulators envision. Speaking at the opening event for the Nesta Open Up Challenge - a competition to find teams creating the best digital services for small business customers on top of these newly opened up APIs - there was general consensus that open banking is over a decade away from mass adoption from consumers. Open banking is basically an inevitability now as regulators in the UK and Europe ramp up implementation of new standards like PSD2 (Revised Payment Service Directive), which will require banks to open up anonymised customer data for third parties to access via application programming interfaces (APIs). The intention is to make banking more transparent, open and competitive, to the benefit of the average consumer. Venture capitalist and global head of Fintech at EY, Imran Gulamhuseinwala, agrees that open banking is \"inevitable\", in that there is \"an unstoppable march to using data and putting it into the hands of customers\".  In reality though consumer adoption of new services may not be as drastic as regulators intend. Tom Blomfield, founder of digital challenger bank Monzo, said during the event: \"People tend to overestimate the impact of technology developments in the short term and underestimate it in the long term. I feel that is what is happening with PSD2.\" Monzo, to all intents and purposes, is very keen for open banking to be a success as its app-centric platform is set up to benefit from the opening up and unbundling of banking services, giving consumers a better interface to manage their finances from. Blomfield, who also cofounded the direct debits startup GoCardless, knows that consumers don't move that quickly though. \"People will be underwhelmed in the short term by what is achieved, but in the long term it will herald a real revolution, but that long term I don't think is five years, it might be ten to twenty years.\"  Jeni Tennison, CEO of the Open Data Institute - a vocal exponent of open banking - agreed with the 2020 timescale. She said: \"We won't see much very different in terms of services until then as it takes time to create a business or service that brings extra value. \"Longer term we can foresee a time where banking operates more as a commodity, so you are less choosing your bank account based on the interface because you can choose the interface you want to use across multiple accounts in a way that suits you,\" she said, referring to an approach otherwise known as banking-as-a-service. Izabella Kaminska, a blogger for the Financial Times' Alphaville site also doesn't envision a groundswell of public adoption from day one. \"My perception is the industry is obsessed with this as a goldmine, it is going to be exceptionally revolutionary, in the short term actually, but the consumer side of the equation is a bit 'meh'. Most people I speak to just don't care enough about their bank, it is seen as a utility,\" she said. Entries for the Nesta Open Up challenge are now open with up to PS5 million in prize money and other incentives available to up to 20 teams that can build the best service, app or tool on top of the new open banking APIs. The aim of the challenge is to bring \"game-changing value for UK small businesses\". For more information visit openup.challenges.org. ",

      "content": "As the Tech Nation 2017 report went out yesterday the UK government, startup founders and venture capitalists have once again highlighted the importance of regional \"clusters\" to help grow the sector across the whole of the UK, and not just in London. The report, which details the current state of the UK tech industry, shows that new clusters are popping up around the UK, adding to the successes of companies like DeepMind in Cambridge, Skyscanner in Edinburgh, and Sage in Newcastle. It goes on to say: \"The rapid rate of growth of tech sectors in the regions is creating exciting and unexpected concentrations of tech companies. For example Bournemouth and Poole has the highest concentration of high growth firms in terms of annual turnover; while Dundee has seen the highest percentage growth (up 67 percent) in jobs created, second only to London (up 95 percent).\" The report also notes that UK tech workers are paid on average 44 percent more than non-tech workers and that the distribution of these jobs is growing, with salaries in Newcastle, Sheffield and Leeds seeing particularly strong growth, with salaries rising by over 25 percent in the past five years.  In a foreword for the report UK Prime Minister Theresa May noted that it is the responsibility of government to \"deliver a high-skilled, high paid Britain where opportunity is spread across every community, not just the traditional areas of London and the South East\". However the idea of a Northern Powerhouse, and that the tech sector is given enough attention outside of the M25, has often led to scepticism. Although the various clusters are growing, London still dominates most metrics. For example, digital turnover in London for 2015 was PS56 billion, with the nearest cluster being Reading at PS12.5 billion. What the report does show is that 2016 saw more investment from venture capital and private equity funds going to companies' from outside of London than within. Based on data from Pitchbook for all venture capital and private equity deals in 2016, PS4.6 billion (68 percent) was invested in companies from regions outside of London, as opposed to PS2.2 billion (32 percent) in London-based companies. Of the regions, Edinburgh-based companies brought in the most investment in 2016 at PS159 million, then Cambridge at PS153 million, then Bristol and Bath at PS109 million.  Karen Bradley, secretary of state for culture, media and sports echoed the party line on the importance of distributing this investment across the UK. Speaking at the launch event for the report yesterday she said: \"Money is pouring in from around the world and our task is to spread it around even further.\" Wendy Tan White, who is currently a general partner at Entrepreneur First, takes a positive view of companies like chip designer Arm Holdings being acquired overseas, saying that it could be the UK's \"Intel moment\". \"That liquidity really pushes investment into the cluster,\" she said during a panel session yesterday. \"There will no doubt be a massive influx of investment now around Cambridge because of that. With Skyscanner in Edinburgh, I know those guys are investing and really holding companies up there. For an ecosystem to work for young startups you need a set of mentors that have existed through every stage.\" Saul Klein, a venture capitalist at Index Ventures agreed, stating that \"exits create ecosystems\". Echoing White's comments regarding an Intel effect, he was referring to the theory that a successful tech company can infuse capital and talent into an ecosystem and create more companies in the long term. The same effect can be seen more recently in the way that PayPal alumni Elon Musk, Ken Howery, Luke Nosek, Max Levchin and Peter Thiel went on to either build (Tesla and Palantir) or invest in (Facebook) some of the biggest tech companies of the past decade.  The flip side of this though is that a lot of long term value is removed from the UK economy, as these companies profits end up going to US investors. As Giles Palmer, CEO of UK startup Brandwatch said: \"I would focus on this idea that we create lots of [intellectual property] IP here and have great researchers but a lot of those guys end up creating value for the shareholders of American companies. \"So I would encourage all of us to think about how we can build UK companies and on being a UK entrepreneur. Let's take IP and talent and create British businesses that retain the IP and value as much as possible for as long as possible.\" CEO of Sage Stephen Kelly added: \"This is not binary, it is not London and the rest, we want all boats rising. The better London does, the better the UK will do.\" ",

      "content": "As the dust settled on the 2008 financial crisis, the Bank of England started a process that would eventually open the door for a new type of bank to enter the market. In an attempt to introduce more competition into an industry that was seen as a black box from the outside and which had lost touch with its customers, the Bank of England revealed a simplified two-step process with lower capital requirements for setting up new banks in 2013.  Two years after these changes the Bank of England reported a visible change in the market. It said: \"We expect this trend to continue over the next few years, particularly where there is a gap in the market - whether it be the service they provide, the customers they target, the products they sell or the technology they use.\" A YouGov survey from 2013 shows just how far the public's trust in the banking industry had eroded. Eighty-four percent of respondents agreed with the statement \"bankers are greedy and get paid too much\". This is where the challenger banks come in. These new banks can start afresh from a reputational and technological standpoint. Not only have they not been tarnished with the financial crash but they can build their IT systems from scratch, saving on the costs of maintaining sprawling legacy systems, not to mention a network of expensive brick and mortar branches on the high street. Fast forward to 2016 and this new breed of bank is starting to get licensed. These banks are looking to appeal to modern customers with an entirely mobile, digital banking experience, with greater transparency around where your money is going and how they operate internally. They promise to offer digital products that live on your phone, with potential features like real-time balance information, deep-dive spending data, biometric security, open API integrations, no foreign exchange charges, simple money transfers and artificial intelligence layering for more predictive banking. Let's not get carried away though. However good an idea a new type of bank sounds, it is far from simple to execute. First they have to acquire a licence, then they have to create a product that is so much better than the incumbents that it drives people to switch their bank, something consumers don't tend to do.   Lastly there is the issue of trust. It is mildly annoying when Uber crashes and you lose a taxi. There's much more at stake when you make an important transaction. So these new banks know full well how important a reliable service is when trying to convince people to trust a new type of bank with your hard-earned cash. As experienced fintech commentator Chris Skinner told Techworld.com: \"People talk about \"the Uber of banking.\" There is no Uber of banking. There won't be one, and anyone that has the ambition to be one will hit a wall.\" Skinner wasn't all doom and gloom though. He added: \"Some are starting with the idea that they want to be a cool tech-based digital bank but they don't have a clear idea of where their customers will come from. Some are more seasoned and understand the customer propositions, and those are the ones I have more confidence in.\" My (entirely arbitrary) criteria for ranking these new digital banks, in descending order of importance is: Do they have a licence, funding to date, people (the pedigree of both the internal leadership and its investors), breadth of banking products, user experience of the mobile app and branding/marketing. So, the banks, in order: The only bank on this list based outside of London, the apparent beating heart of fintech, comes out on top: Atom Bank from Durham in the North East of England. Atom was authorised to take customer deposits as long ago as November 2015 and launched in full after its regulatory authorisation restrictions were lifted in April 2016, when it launched its mobile app.  Atom Bank started providing two-year fixed rate residential mortgages through selected independent advisers in December 2016 to join its two Fixed Saver accounts and SME lending product. Customers can track any changes to their mortgage progress after receiving a decision in principle (DIP) through the Atom app.  The current process doesn't exactly sound game-changing though. Atom says: \"Customers can find an intermediary who is able to discuss Atom mortgages via our customer support team,\" via email or phone. Atom works with 800 mortgage providers and will make all providers searchable once this process becomes available on the app, with the bank unwilling to share a timeline for this functionality at present. Atom also told Techworld that it is working on a mortgage tracking service, similar to that offered by startup mortgage brokers like Trussle and Habito, but again provided no timeline. Atom will be launching a full suite of banking products throughout 2017, including current accounts, debit cards, overdrafts and instant access savings, all of which will be managed via the app. Unlike Starling or Mondo (more on them later) Atom hasn't built its core IT systems from scratch, instead building on commoditised banking software from FIS before layering integrations within the middleware and building a unique front end (the mobile app) on top. Atom will offer a full repertoire of banking products, from current accounts and savings to loans and mortgages for both personal and business customers. Chief innovations officer Edward Twiddy explained the motivation behind this approach to Techworld: \"From our perspective the core engine needs to be bulletproof, located in a bullet proof environment. It doesn't need to be fancy.\" Twiddy explained that the core systems that facilitate the moving of money need to integrate with a number of legacy systems, and regulators and credit unions would be more comfortable integrating with an established, commodity software. Atom bank has an impressive pedigree at board level, with the co-founder of an established challenger Metro Bank, Anthony Thomson, as Chairman, and CEO Mark Mullen was hired from HSBC's internet and telephone banking division First Direct. Being from the North East allows Atom to present a good, honest northern front, much like BT did with its marketing of PlusNet as \"good honest broadband from Yorkshire,\" after acquiring the small internet service provider (ISP) for PS67m in 2007. In Atom's words: \"Based in Durham in the North East, we're a passionate bunch of people who want to make banking better. We're building a bank, with lots of heart and plenty of soul.\" Funding: Atom Bank has raised PS135m in capital so far and is reportedly looking to raise another PS100 million. Set up by Tom Blomfield following his controversial exit from rival challenger Starling (which he co-founded with Boden after exiting another fintech company he founded, GoCardless, in 2013), it is not surprising that Monzo (formerly Mondo) is seemingly founded on similar principles to the above. Namely: a full-stack approach to the technology and a user-friendly, data driven approach to personal finance. Monzo gained its full, unrestricted banking licence from UK regulators in February 2017. This means the now-official bank can hold customer money and offer products like current accounts. Monzo wants to make it possible to open an account without a human conversation, in under a minute and with as much starting capital as you want. As Blomfield puts it: \"I'm not asking people to get married on the first date. So deposit fifty quid and we'll give you a card and you can see how it works, and if you have a problem see how we deal with that.\" Thanks to being one of the most open in its approach, Monzo's app is the one we know the most about from a features perspective. There is a real-time breakdown of your spending habits, quick mobile money transfers, integrations with the likes of Transport for London, Uber and fellow fintech company Nutmeg, some AI layering to better predict your banking habits, zero foreign exchange rates and possibly biometrics for security. Blomfield feels that a challenger bank will have a truly disruptive impact on the industry and become one of those can't-live-without home screen applications, saying: \"There will be bank started this decade that will be the size of Google or Facebook.\" The founder is also openly critical of challenger banks that are building off of established, commoditised banking IT systems: \"If you just want to see the same old products then go ahead and buy the pre-existing products, but if you want to be adaptable and deliver 21st century expected experiences, then you need to own the stack. If you were to ask Google or Facebook if they could have delivered on a generic back-end and built a nice front-end they would have laughed.\" You can also keep up to date with what Monzo is up to through its product roadmap, which is a publicly available Trello board. Funding: Monzo raised a PS19.5 million investment round with Thrive Capital, Passion Capital and Orange Digital Ventures in February alongside a PS2.5 million crowdfunding round on Crowdcube (the Crowdcube site crashed due to investor demand from Monzo's previous PS1 million round). This brings total funding to PS22 million.  Founded by Anne Boden, the former chief operating officer of Allied Irish Bank, Starling received its initial license with restrictions in July 2016 and started accepting beta customers to open current accounts through its app in March 2017. Where Atom Bank has built its core banking systems on commoditised banking software from FIS Global, Starling is building its IT systems from the ground up, in-house, something it refers to as a \"full stack\" approach. For a fuller explanation Boden's blog post on the subject is pretty succinct. The app will offer alerts for smarter money management, helping to avoid customers incurring unwanted fees. You will get a real-time picture of your accounts and spending and money transfers should be seamless. Head of marketing Terry McParlane told Techworld.com: \"We're trying to flip the banking model on its head. Where banks have used data against their customers, our approach is taking the opportunities of the technology and open APIs to empower customers on how to use their money.\" Funding: Starling has raised PS70m to date, led by angel investor Harald McPike.  Tandem received FCA and PRA accreditation on 30 November 2015 but received a setback in March this year when its banking licence was suspended after investor House of Fraser pulled out of supplying a proposed PS29 million of funding due to \"uncertainty about whether China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange would approve the transaction\". The challenger bank needed the funding in order to take deposits and offer basic retail banking services. CEO Ricky Knox told the Financial Times that Tandem is still planning to unveil its app in the coming months, but \"we will no longer be launching savings accounts in the short term\", he said. In November it launched its app in beta for what it calls a community of \"cofounders\" to open a savings account. Credit cards, loans and current accounts are due to be rolled out sometime in 2017. Tandem has opted to use off-the-shelf technology to provide its core banking software and infrastructure with Fiserv's Agiliti platform, which it developed in collaboration with Atom Bank. This allows Tandem to go-to-market quicker than building the core system themselves. CEO Ricky Knox told The Memo in 2016: \"A really cool mobile app is great, but it's not what is going to drive mass customer uptake.\" Where Tandem is looking to stand out is in its proactive approach to money management, helping customers make their money go further instead of the bank looking to sell products that will make them money. This will come in the form of notifications if you miss a payment or approach your overdraft, as well as preferred rates for alternative savings and investment services, both with Tandem and third parties. Tandem appears to be focusing its marketing on millennials, as well as distancing itself from the sort of banking institutions the public seems to have lost trust in. Tandem therefore is a \"good bank\" and a \"new bank built by people like you,\" as shown by its Twitter cover image of people in casual clothing, some with beards, some without. Funding: According to the FT Tandem has raised more than PS100m in capital ahead of launch. ",

      "content": "Nvidia, the graphics processing unit specialist, is looking to attract startups working with machine learning technology to opt for their hardware over cloud providers like Microsoft and AWS, in a land grab for the lucrative niche of AI startups. Startups building products on top of cutting edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology require a huge amount of computing power in order to process large amounts of data, which is expensive. Cloud giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have traditionally given away thousands of dollars in credits for startups to court them onto their platforms. This can pay huge dividends if you manage to get a Snapchat or Airbnb onto your services early on, as shown by Snap's $1 billion commitment to AWS over the next five years. For AI-focused companies these credits could be put towards running graphics processing units (GPUs) - which are better than traditional CPUs at processing large amounts of data - on their virtual machines in the cloud at a discount. This is extremely useful for the kind of compute-intensive modelling that is required in the background for companies using machine and deep learning techniques. Now, the GPU manufacturer Nvidia is going head to head with the cloud giants with its Inception Program, in a drive to court the best AI startups directly onto their hardware. Jack Watts, startup business manager at Nvidia explained to Techworld that the aim of the programme, which was launched last summer, is \"nurturing those startups and helping them get access to hardware and marketing lift with us, but really the whole thing is about driving this community of startups which are doing weird and wonderful things with AI and Nvidia GPUs.\" Members can apply for GPU hardware grants and will be invited to try the latest software and hardware, such as the Nvidia Deep Learning SDK, Digits deep learning GPU training System and the GPU Inference Engine. Nvidia also provides startups with access to expertise, so they can speak to solution architects to ask questions about which hardware would be best for a specific project (the answer probably being Nvidia), or for advice on certain frameworks or cloud providers. Members also get access to the Nvidia Deep Learning Institute (DLI), with credits going towards training courses.  Startups will get the chance to catch the eye of Nvidia's ventures programme, called GPU Ventures, which got good returns on an investment in mobile game developer NaturalMotion, a company that was acquired by Zynga for $527 million in 2014. The part that will really grab startup founder's attention though is the discounted hardware. The Nvidia DGX-1 supercomputer, for example, can provide 2-3 times performance improvements over other GPU options in the market and is available to Inception members at rates comparable to that given to academic institutions. The problem is that a DGX-1 retails for PS178,000, so balancing that sort of capital expenditure (capex) against the operational expenditure (opex) of spinning up virtual machines in the cloud is a tricky proposition for startups. This is exactly the issue that UK AI startup Onfido has been grappling with since joining the 80 or so UK startups on the Inception programme. Speaking to Techworld, Rahul Amin, CTO and cofounder of the identify verification startup said that it is \"hard\" to decide when to buy hardware against spinning up instances in the cloud, and that they currently do a combination of the two. \"We probably haven't found the right balance yet,\" he said.  Onfido uses machine learning to verify government issued documents for employers and sharing economy platforms that are increasingly keen to verify users and cut down on fraud. Which means Amin understands the importance of GPUs to his core business as well as anyone. \"GPUs have been a fundamental part of this process for doing machine learning\", he said. \"We started off with a singular machine with a gaming graphics card, as a startup it was all about being efficient. We started to train models for extracting text from a document and as the company grew we have introduced various servers and each development machine has GPUs in them.\" Cost is the main issue for a startup though, even one as well funded (PS25 million to date) as Onfido. \"It has always been a concern how much we spend on GPUs,\" Amin said. \"If you spin up a machine in the cloud it is going to cost you if you run it for a long time, so balancing what is the best way to train models has been an interesting decision and a conversation we continually have in terms of optimising our hardware and providing engineers with the right level of hardware.\" ",

      "content": "The number of startups in the UK keeps growing, and the number of jobs they offer with them. According to StartUp Britain, a record 657,790 new businesses were started across the country in 2016. But finding the right role at the right company isn't easy. Tech careers advisor Samantha Hepburn went from teaching herself how to code to running three tech communities of her own. She shared her insights on how tech recruitment works and how to find a startup job at the Jobbio EXPAND careers event in London. (Browse the latest tech jobs with Techworld.) Startups aren't all free food, goodie bags and foosball tables, and neither are they solely staffed by developers and entrepreneurs. They encompass a wide spectrum of cultures and career opportunities. \"The nice thing about that is that every startup is looking for something different, so there is a startup out there that is looking for your skill set,\" says Hepburn. Her preferred description is the one proposed by Paul Graham, the computer scientist and venture capitalist behind Viaweb, the world's first application service provider (ASP): \"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup, nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, take venture funding or have some sort of exit. The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.\" \"It doesn't matter what your skillset is or what they do, they all only want one specific thing,\" says Hepburn. \"Humans. They're trying to foster their own culture, and every culture will be different for every company. What's really cool about this is that now more than ever it is not only about what you know, but who you are as a person. What do you bring to the table? What are your skills? What is your demographic? \"You need to start thinking about what it is. Not every startup is looking for the free agent forward thinking innovator who loves autonomy, never needs to be managed, can sit on a beach in the Bahamas and get all the work done. Not every startup is looking for that.\" If you showcase who you are an as individual they can see how you'll fit into the culture and interact with the team. \"There are so many startups out there and finding a job regardless of where you're looking can be really hard and time-consuming, so you need to start identifying what it is you actually want,\" says Hepburn. She recommends that startup jobseekers write a list of whatever they liked in their previous jobs and studies, whether it's work tasks, office environment, colleagues or social aspects and to then do the exact same thing for the things you hated. Highlight the non-negotiables to establish your professional priorities Traditional recruitment agencies and CV libraries such as Reed, Monster and Indeed aren't always the richest sources of startup jobs. The reason why? \"It's bloody expensive,\" says Hepburn. \"It costs the company anything between 10-20 percent of your annual salary to hire you through a recruitment company. Most startups don't have that money, and even if they did, they'd rather spend that money on something else. So they're using alternative methods.\" Recruitment agencies aren't entirely barren plains, but they're time-consuming to search and a CV rarely reveals who you are. Job boards yield fertile lands. They allow recruitment agencies to post relevant roles or let you apply directly to the hiring company. AngelList, Jobbio, Unicorn Hunt and Tech City Jobs all advertise a wide selection of startup jobs. Tech mailing lists are another avenue, and the production costs force companies to post their job advertisements strategically. \"The chances are if you're reading a mailing list, you're the demographic they're looking to hire,\" explains Hepburn. \"So take a punt and apply.\" Don't neglect to search through a company's cheapest place to advertise: its own website. The list of operating startups is constantly changing. Tech Britain provides a comprehensive map of the country's startup community and lets user search by industry to find the sector in which they're most interested. Even if a company that you love is not advertising a role, you can reach out to them regardless. If it doesn't result in a job immediately, it may still do in future. Startups tend to grow organically, expanding an idea devised by friends into a team composed of former colleagues and acquaintances. \"A lot of hiring through startups happens through a referral process of people they know,\" says. \"So how do you get hired? You get into their network.\" You don't have to stalk them at their yoga class. Networking events take place every day. They can be found through Meetup groups such as Find a Tech Job, communities such as Circle, and mailing lists devised by working spaces or organisations such as General Assembly. The events often centre on a talk, but the networking drinks afterwards provide a better chance to meet people and learn about their companies. Even if it doesn't lead directly to your dream job, meeting people who have found theirs can help teach you how to get yours. At the very least, being an active member of a community will be a useful addition to your CV. The CV needs to reflect the requirements of the job that you're applying for, so it may need modifications for different individual roles. Cover letters are another important document to attract a potential employee's attention. \"I say short and sweet but you need to not only tell them why you are good for the role, you need to tell them why you chose them,\" Hepburn suggests. \"Why out of all the startups in the world, do you want to work for them? People want people who want to work there. It's hard, it's long hours, it's smaller teams, people have to get their hands dirty, so you need to write in that cover letter why it is.\" Lacking a specific skill doesn't mean that you can't learn it. Sometimes showing your interest and passion is more important than your qualifications. Global corporations may boast massive HR departments, but they'll likely be small ones at a startup, if there's any HR team at all. The head of the department will often be the person responsible for recruitment. \"The marketing team needs to grow? The marketing manager is probably looking for a candidate,\" says Hepburn. \"They have a full-time job to do and they have to recruit you. Once you've joined, their workload will probably drop, but they've got to get the work done. So if you ping them an email, drop an application and you don't hear back, it doesn't mean they don't like you.\" Recruitment is a skill and they might not have the time or training to do it efficiently. Sometimes when startups are growing fast they hire new roles without knowing exactly what they are looking for, so talk to them and offer your own advice. They'll value your feedback and honesty even if you think that they don't need you. It might lead them to remember you when they're looking for a more appropriate role. Whichever part of the application of the application process you're at, don't be afraid to follow up. Hepburn likes to receive an email reminder a week after the initial contact. \"But then I also have a three strike rule,\" she adds. \"If after three times they don't get back to you, move on. One, they obviously know whether to respond, and two, you've got better things to do.\" Don't burn your bridges if you don't get your job, as they may still want you in the future. Staying in touch could have further career benefits. \"Keep that connection open, stay in their network,\" says Hepburn. \"One, they could actually phone you up at a later date and you could go work for them, and two, the industry is actually smaller than you think and they could refer you into other roles.\" ",

      "content": "Ping pong tables, free food, slides, sleeping pods, pet-friendly offices and on-site gyms are just a few of the perks tech companies like to boast they offer to employees. Some of the benefits on offer sound amazing. Who wouldn't want desk massages? But these attention-grabbing schemes can come at a price for employees: high stress and long hours. \"Don't confuse perks with a positive workplace culture,\" Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at the University of Manchester, tells Techworld. \"For most, perks are about attracting and retaining talent, while providing an environment that can help them to do their best work...Every company has their reasons. I think these are often sound and sometimes misguided,\" says Rob O'Donovan, cofounder of human resources startup CharlieHR. However \"perks are not the thing that makes a person's job satisfying,\" Cooper says. \"What causes people satisfaction at work? Number one is to be valued and trusted. Most important is good relationships with work colleagues,\" he adds. At best, perks can be the icing on the cake of a healthy, happy work environment. But at worst, they can be infantilising (bales of hay to sit on in meetings, anyone?) and trapping (who needs to leave the office if there's a gym, napping areas and free food?!). Perks can be \"tactical interventions that seek to address cultural malaise at a reactionary level...sadly many people think that by only treating surface symptoms, cultural magic will happen\", says Esko Reinikainen, 'culture hacker' and cofounder of Satori Lab. O'Donovan agrees: \"Where it goes wrong is when perks are considered a silver bullet to problems and there isn't a clearly defined or well thought through strategy. There's the idea that if you stick a ping pong table in the office and fill the fridge with free beer everyone will be happy, but it's far more nuanced than that.\" \"These perks can even begin to make people develop lopsided relationships. If you look at the people in these tech companies they work long hours and sit in front of screens. As many diversions as there are in the office, they don't have the time to make the most of it,\" Cooper adds. So what should firms focus on instead? More face-to-face contact, reasonable working hours, ensuring manageable workloads and good quality managers for starters, says Cooper. \"In the end it's about relationships. We've got to change the nature of the work environment. We need more face-to-face contact, no sending of emails in the same building, and we need people to switch off after work,\" he says. One of the leading indicators of happiness at work is your relationship with your line manager, says Cooper. \"If they are bad and inefficient, or socially insensitive, that will damage people's health,\" he explains. Some firms have taken the idea of trust and transparency to another level: trivago allows staff to determine their own working hours and they have unlimited holidays, according to organisational development lead Anitta Krishan. \"We believe that the measure of an employee's performance is not time but the value they add to our business,\" she says. Companies should encourage people to interact and form good relationships with work colleagues if they want staff to be happy at work, according to Cooper. He also recommends restricting email access out-of-hours (as per Daimler and the French government). \"I'm not negative about these perks and creating that kind of environment. But it isn't the answer to the productivity puzzle. The leading cause of absence from work is stress, so we have to think about that carefully,\" he adds. The main priority should be identifying which patterns of behaviour contribute to or detract from a healthy culture, says Reinikainen. \"From that awareness, organisations are in the position to develop strategies that amplify or dampen the issues that incentivise or disincentivise staff from behaving in the ways that contribute to the desired healthy culture,\" he says. Ultimately, the things that make people happy are having good relationships at work, being paid properly, feeling trusted and valued by your line manager and feeling you have control and autonomy in your job, according to Cooper. Perhaps it is that, and not perks, that tech companies should pay a bit more attention to if they truly value the happiness of their staff. ",

      "content": "RegTech startups tend to focus on helping financial institutions contend with growing regulatory requirements after the 2008 financial crash, including automation of compliance tasks, mitigating operational risks and improving risk assessment through smarter use of data and more intuitive software. Deloitte's 2016 report (pdf) 'Is RegTech the new FinTech?' puts it simply: \"Increasing levels of regulation and a greater focus on data and reporting has however brought the RegTech offering into greater focus thereby creating more value for the firms that invest in these solutions.\" Rob Moffat, partner at Balderton Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in two RegTech startups on this list, told Techworld: \"The banks are under pressure and finding it hard to find new revenue sources. There is more and more regulatory costs, so they are more open to ways to change and improve there.\" Here are some of the most innovative RegTech startups in the UK today, whether they are helping big banks stay ahead of their complex compliance requirements, or businesses remain compliant through smarter anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) checks. London-based credit risk management startup Credit Benchmark was founded in 2012 by ex-Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers employee Mark Faulkner. It specialises in pooling, aggregating and anonymising credit risk data from leading global banks, so that financial institutions can make better risk management and capital allocation decisions. Credit Benchmark completed a $20 million (PS16.5 million) funding round in July 2015 led by Balderton Capital. ComplyAdvantage is another Balderton Capital-backed RegTech startup which provides businesses with a feed of proprietary anti-money laundering (AML) risk data as well as on-boarding screening solutions and a monitoring platform for know your customer (KYC) processes. The system collects data from sources such as Interpol's watch list, international sanctions and media reports to automate due diligence on clients that pose a criminal risk. Off the back of this data it can provide solutions like enhanced due diligence reports, risk and compliance advice and HR services. Stephen Ball, VP of sales and marketing, told Business Insider: \"We're focused around understanding the risk around people and companies you do business with. What we've built is an AI and machine learning thing under the radar for several years. It's a very difficult thing to do, we've invested millions in building our team and to monitor global data sources and build profiles of people who pose financial crime risk.\" ComplyAdvantage raised $8.2 million (PS6.8 million) led by Balderton Capital in October 2016. London startup Onfido is using machine learning to provide organisations with faster access to robust identity and background checks for employees and clients. Founded by a trio of Oxford graduates, the platform plugs into various publicly available databases to give employers quick identity verification and background checks for things like employment and criminal records. In their own words, Onfido's \"intelligent software revolutionises the archaic background checking industry through automated data aggregation and verification\". Where this can help with regulation is for employee background checks and anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulatory requirements. Onfido raised a strong Series B funding round of $25 million (PS19 million) in April, led by Idinvest Partners. The London startup DueDil's underlying database allows for compliance teams to self serve reports on clients to aid in AML and KYC reporting. The DueDil platform pulls together data from thousands of sources including company websites, financial filings, news reports, registry data, trademarks, and country court judgments. This information is then searchable by company and presented on a user friendly platform. This helps companies do their due diligence (hence the name) and avoid risks by identifying the right companies to sell to, get insights into their business, and make a sale. Since 2011 DueDil has raised nearly $30m (PS20.6m) from investors including Oak Investment Partners, Passion Capital and Notion Capital. Its customers include Royal Mail, Stripe and Kuoni. CheckRecipient saves you from the horror situation of sending a sensitive email to the wrong recipient. The core product, called Guardian, analyses millions of data points across your organisation's email network to detect patterns of behaviour and surface misaddressed emails. If the machine learning algorithm spots an unusual email address or detects potentially sensitive information in the content it will prompt the sender to double check before sending. It also provides pre-packaged solutions for preventing misaddressed emails as well as problems like email rules, compliance and audit and sensitive attachment protection. CheckRecipient integrates with existing email platforms including Microsoft Exchange and Citrix. The startup is institutionally backed by Winton Ventures. A graduate from the Microsoft London accelerator, Suade was founded by two former city traders and focuses on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) which helps firms simplify their compliance processes and regulatory obligations. Suade wants to give everyone involved with the regulatory submission process a single platform, with automated workflows and a single source of truth when it comes to the data. Cofounder Diana Paredes told Techworld that their technology helps organisations move away from legacy systems, \"by leveraging modern technology you can do things faster, more efficiently and transparently. Openness is key in regulation\". Suade has received funding from the European Commission and ODI (Open Data Institute) to work on an open source project called Financial Regulatory Data Schema (FIRE) and was part of the government's Afterburner Programme. East-London based startup FundApps is going after the very specific business problems of shareholder disclosure. The solution is a cloud-based system which automates shareholding reporting. The API delivered platform brings together up-to-date regulation information from its partner Aosphere, with pre-populated filing documents that promise to cut down on human errors and save compliance teams time by matching and automating a key part of their workflow. FundApps has been bootstrap funded up to this point. Similar to Onfido, Oxford based RegTech startup Contego focuses on checks for people, clients and ID documents to ensure compliance. Its underlying database allows Contego to provide risk management tools for companies to perform employee screening, fraud investigation, KYC and AML checks, and monitoring services. Customers can integrate Contego into existing systems and workflows with its API. Contego received PS900,000 in seed funding in 2013 from the Rainbow Seed Fund; the Angel CoFund and a set of angel investors. Percentile focuses on building software for risk officers at capital markets firms to stay abreast of regulatory requirements like stress testing and the Basel III framework. The London startup wants to help risk managers get away from spreadsheets. It automates and aggregates risk across the organisation and the wider market to take away some of the more tedious work related to regulatory requirements. London-based regtech startup Kompli Global provides organisations with identity and background vetting for staff and customers, helping them to spot 'politically exposed persons' (people entrusted with a prominent public function). It was founded by serial entrepreneur John Davies (pictured) in July 2016.  Using its own Boolean search engine and local staff in every major country, Kompli helps companies vet individuals, and spot and continuously monitor PEPs and their associates around the globe. This makes it easier for organisations to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering regulations while onboarding and maintaining relationships with people and companies. ",

      "content": "It's the day before Valentine's Day and I have forgotten to buy my girlfriend anything. At the top of my inbox I have an email from the flower delivery startup Bloom and Wild offering me a discount code on bouquets and guaranteed delivery for February 14th. I click the link and am taken straight into the mobile app and the discount has already been applied to the products I can see on the screen. How did the startup's backend system know where my order was originating and to apply a discount code without me having to enter it at checkout? That is the work of Branch's deep linking, and it is having a profound effect for marketing teams at some of the world's biggest retail startups. Branch is a tech startup from Silicon Valley that was created when the app developer founders saw how difficult it was to link between channels like web and email to a mobile app, where conversions tend to be higher. The advantage of this is opening up traditional customer acquisition channels to drive mobile app downloads, instead of relying solely on the app store. Accommodation booking giant Airbnb is using Branch links to drive app installs and reported a 19 percent uptick as a result. As Ramsey Pryor, head of international expansion at Branch, told Techworld: \"We have been working on this full time for two and a half years with 50 engineers and although it may seem simple it's not once you look across platforms and every instance. You get a benefit of outsourcing that headache to us.\" In terms of UK customers Branch already has major commercial companies like Notonthehightstreet.com and Skyscanner using its tools to drive more conversions. Branch takes a developer-first approach to user acquisition, similar to Silicon Valley giants like Stripe and Twilio, and relies on its community to spread the word. Once the free SDK is implemented at a company they tend to start leveraging the premium, more marketing-facing tools like deep linked email, smart banner ads and user journey analytics. The Bloom and Wild example above comes from Branch's ability to deep link within email marketing, which is important because 70 percent of email is done on mobile now, according to Branch. Bloom and Wild Flowers cofounder Aron Gelbard told Techworld: \"We realised we wanted to send emails regarding products and to include a call to action to allow users to buy in email, so we wanted that to point to the product in-app if they have the app, and the website if not.\" After this first use case, Bloom and Wild expanded into more sophisticated deep linking to personalise which content customers were landing on and to make applying discount codes more seamless. Gelbard says the company has seen a significant decrease in drop offs at the point where customers had to apply a discount code manually. The startup is also using Branch's deep linking capabilities to gain better attribution insights. Gelbard explained: \"We now use [Branch] when there is no discount code, so by attribution as well. So if you click an adwords link, or an email about Valentine's Day with no discount code we still apply a code with a Branch deep link which hides that code. That enables us to not need to give out as many codes and still track the user.\" Gelbard said that he didn't see a viable alternative on the market to solve his deep linking issues and that he was impressed by Branch's developer ecosystem and standing in the startup community. The company is already looking ahead to Valentine's Day next year, applying data science to improve the user experience further. Gelbard explained: \"We are growing the data science team for personalisation and have started to implement this for different customers, seeing different products, in a different order depending on what the data says is most interesting to them. \"So for Valentine's Day we merchandise differently around previous purchase behaviour to make the process more seamless.\" ",

      "content": "Slow Wi-Fi signal can leave even the calmest person ready to throw their router out the window. Here's why your Wi-Fi signal is slow, plus we explain how to speed up your internet connection and boost your Wi-Fi strength and connectivity.  Whether you're a small business, a startup relying on as home broadband connection or a company with bigger connectivity needs, read on to boost your Wi-Fi connection...  Additional reporting from Sandro Villinger. First you've got to establish the actual speed you're receiving. To do this simply visit a speed testing site, we like Speed Test. From there click begin and it will tell you your upload and download speed. The UK average download speed was around 22.8Mbps last year. The latest Wi-Fi standard is 802.11ac. This standard and the 802.11n are the most desireable for fast connectivity. If your router is either 802.11b or 802.11g standard a new router would definitely boost your Wi-Fi speed and provide a longer range of connectivity. If you've been a loyal customer, most internet providers will send you the newest router for free but others may charge a delivery cost of around PS3-PS6. Here's how to check what Wi-Fi standard you're running on: 1. Click on the Wi-Fi shortcut (usually found on the bottom right of PC screen) 2. Hover your cursor over the broadband service you are using 3. The standard will be listed next to 'Radio Type' The day your router is set up, it automatically detects the least crowded channel and makes that its default. However, with the arrival of new neighbors or offices nearby, the situation may change quickly. All of a sudden, one channel may be used by a handful of routers while others are deserted. There are some great tools that will help determine whether you should change Wi-Fi channel. Software like InSSIDer and NirSoft analyses the entire Wi-Fi spectrum and gives you details about your home network as well as channel usage meaning you can change to a less busy channel. Most internet providers will have step-by-step tutorials on how to do this as procedures can differ. The 2.4GHz frequency is crowded. Not just with neighbors using the same frequency, but also baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens and more. Modern 802.11n and 802.11ac routers offer \"dualband\", which means they're sending two network signals; one at 2.4GHz, and one at 5GHz, which is far less crowded and offers more channels. One drawback is that many device makers only go with the 2.4 GHz receiver. This includes all portable gaming consoles, and also a slew of smartphones. To get a speedy connection activate both networks and connect the mobile devices to the 2.4 GHz network, just enabling the 5GHz network for your laptops and desktops. Sometimes you can't have the luxury of choosing the 5GHz frequency band or selecting a \"lonely\" channel. In such cases, it may be worthwhile to limit your router to sending out signals at intervals of 20MHz. For small businesses with guest Wi-Fi, limit the guest access to 20MHz giving you and your employees a stronger signal with fewer dropouts. An easy, yet often forgotten piece of advice. Make sure that your router's firmware is up-to-date - especially if you've purchased a new one. Expect bandwidth, feature set and resiliency to signals to increase with the first few firmware updates. The latest firmware update can be downloaded from the manufacurer's website and is relatively simple to update as most have a helpful how-to wizard. Sometimes a USB or built in wireless adapter/driver cannot fully communicate with your PC or laptop and updating it could give it the push it needs to get working again. There are a few free tools to make this proccess easier such as Driver Talent which identifies the problem and offers the best downloadable update available for most operating systems. Mac operating systems can find software update solutions on the Apple website. Use a Wi-Fi heatmapping tool to measure the impact of distance, frequency changes and building structures on signal strength. Two tools that are great for this job are NetSpot for Mac and Heatmapper for Windows. Both tools allow you to track Wi-Fi coverage in your office or home. The more points you scan, the more exact your Wi-Fi heatmap. Once you're done, you end up with a map that shows you not just the signal strength but also the throughput of your Wi-Fi network.  Some routers are set up with their \"power savings\" mode on by default. The goal: save a few milliwatts. Unfortunately, this commendable approach reduced bandwidth disproportionately. If you value bandwidth over minimal power savings, check out the router's setting and look for entries called \"Transmission Power\" or various Eco modes. Turn them OFF. Also, do check if your router sports some sort of \"Automatic\" transmission setting. You may want to turn it off and go \"100 percent\" all the time. Unfortunately, the laws of physics sometimes stand in the way of proper wireless bandwidth and signal strength. The distance between your router and the wireless adapter is a more relevant factor than you might think so avoid placing it near thick brick or concrete walls. Placing the router higher up could make a difference to wireless signal. Your Wi-Fi signal can become weak if your PC is too old or too untidy. One way to boost your Wi-Fi speed is to declutter your PC and shed any unnecessary files or programmes that could be slowing it down.  There's plenty of software that claim to speed up your PC and make the general day-to-day running much smoother. We like AVG PC TuneUp, Avast! Cleanup, CCleaner, and F-Secure Booster. For the best tools to clean your PC see: Eight tools that could speed up your PC. If you share your internet connection with people that like to download videos, stream TV shows or play online video games, you might want to consider setting up a few rules. You could suggest that they download content during less popular times. But if you don't fancy any awkward confrontations, there are tools out there that will prioritise apps or programmes. This should result in the most important programmes getting bandwidth priorities.  ",

      "content": "A minority of startups are lucky enough to never have to shake down others for cash. Either they are self-funded, or they make enough money from clients from day one. However, for most companies investors are vital to help them get off the ground and subsequently expand. Techworld spoke to entrepreneurs who have been there and done it. We got their advice on how you find investors, how you judge which investor is right for you, and how you then agree terms. Here's what they had to say... The first move is to look at your contacts book. Who do you know, and how can they help you? Nick Katz, cofounder of Splittable, recommends a form of networking called 'spiderwebbing', where you meet entrepreneurs, high net worth people, plus friends and family, pitch them on the business, and try to get them to introduce you to at least two people. Carlos Espinal, partner at Seedcamp, agrees it's worth trying to get introductions: \"A strong and functional relationship is the key to any successful investor-founder engagement. As such, the best way to approach finding investors is through introductions from people you trust.\" You have to pitch to a lot of people so be prepared to deal with rejection during this early phase. This is no bad thing - in fact it helps you to improve, says Katz, who pitched 109 people for his first PS150,000 round just over two years ago and ended up with eight investors. He has since raised PS1.2 million across three rounds. \"Getting 'no's' makes you stronger but importantly, no matter how awesome you are your first pitch will be 1000x worse than the final pitch you deliver to close your round,\" he says. Katz adds: \"This is one of the best reasons to start with friends, family and investors you won't be upset about saying no, i.e. people you think would probably say no, no matter what. Burn some of these investor meetings early!\" It's also worth allotting more time to fundraising than you expect. Katz says it takes \"somewhere between two to four times the amount of time you think it will...you won't close in two months. It's going to take six to nine months for your first round\". You need to do your research, advise ManoMano founders Philippe de Chanville and Christian Raisson. Check investor listings and ratings, look at the types of startups they invest in, keep on top of the latest news within your industry, try to get an introduction from a third party, they suggest. Finally, you should always aim to meet a potential investor in person, not just via phone or email. You should think of an investor as an extension of your team, according to Adam Ludwin, cofounder of Captify. Use their insights, knowledge and experience but \"ultimately take the viewpoint that from day one you will include them in your strategy and growth plans... Listen to your investors and you'll be better poised to avoid damaging pitfalls,\" he says. Ideally you want a mix of investors - some that are supportive and boost your confidence, and others that are more challenging and push you on, says Katz. Colette Ballou, founder of Ballou PR, agrees. \"Look to bring in investors of different genders, races, ages and sexual preferences. Your customers will be diverse so it is important that your investors reflect the company's audience,\" she says. Espinal says there are three simple factors: relationship (can you talk openly together, and could you deal with a crisis?), functional capability (does this investor have the right background to help you?) and focus (does this investor invest at the stage and sector your company is in?). It's worth remembering it is a two-way relationship, so don't be scared to ask investors what they can bring to the table, advises Ballou. \"Do they have expertise in expanding companies into different markets or building a great company culture? Can they help you get follow-on funding?  Ask them directly, take note of their answers and hold them to it,\" she says. Katz offers the following advice: During meetings Katz advises listening carefully, trying to avoid interrupting and suggests adapting your pitch to each individual investor you meet. Get advice from people you trust and who have knowledge of negotiating investment terms - be it entrepreneurs, lawyers or other professionals, suggests Katz. Watch out for \"predatory early stage investors\" he warns - of which there are many. It's worth trying to create competitive tension with multiple, competing offers - but keep it simple. \"Try to be as plain vanilla as you possibly can. The simpler the better. The better, the faster you close,\" he says. It's important to be flexible, advises Colette Ballou. \"For people who can't afford to invest, consider placing them on your advisory board and granting them a small amount of equity,\" she says. Ballou also recommends term limits for advisory board members: \"It's controversial, but consider having one-year term limits for advisory board members - renewable, of course. Why should you be stuck with advisory board members who no longer fit your needs?\" Although it's tempting to be aggressive, remember you'll have to work with an investor for a long time, so find someone you can negotiate a fair deal with, says Espinal. \"Prepare in advance by familiarising yourself with what are standard VC terms...Pick your battles and be knowledgeable about what is standard by also asking other founders of similar type of company and that have received venture backing,\" he adds.

      "content": "The UK has provided a loving home for robots ever since Captain Richards & A.H. Reffell built one of the world's first in 1928. \"Eric\" is now reborn following a Kickstarter campaign to bring him back to life and has been given a starring role in a new exhibition at London's Science Museum. The country's startups are ensuring he won't be lonely in future. The robotics market is set to reach $226 billion worldwide by 2021, according to market intelligence company Tractica, more than six times its current value. Research by CB Insights suggests British startups currently account for six percent of the global market, but a growing ecosystem of ambitious visionaries supported by the recently-announced PS17.3 million of funding from the government means many are well-positioned to become world-leaders in the sector.  Minimally invasive surgery tends to be a highly expensive procedure, but Cambridge Medical Robotics is developing a next-generation robotic system that could make it affordable and universally accessible. The startup has already successfully tested the performance of the platform on cadavers. The big plans have already attracted big backing. In July 2016, the company raised $20.3 million in a Series A funding round from investors including ABB Technology Ventures, LGT Global Invest and Cambridge Innovation Capital. London-based startup Automata was founded in January 2015 to democratise robotics by lowering costs and improving usability. The company plans to use a robotics-as-a-service (RAAS) business model to integrate robotics into existing workflows more efficiently and to bring automation to new markets. Automata has attracted an undisclosed quantity of funding from ABB Technology Ventures (ATV). Founders Mostafa El Sayed and Suryansh Chandra previously worked as lead designers at Zaha Hadid Architecture, and their first product should be a welcome one in their former profession. The low-cost, plug and play, table-top robotic arm called Eva is ideally suited for design studios, but has been developed to also work in SMEs from a myriad of other industries. University of Sheffield spin-out Consequential Robotics was established to develop companion and assistive robotic systems to enhance quality of life as people age. The first product developed by the startup is a mechanical pet with dog-like features called MiRO that is said to be \"the first robot that thinks like an animal\". MiRo is controlled by technology modelled on the biological brain, and a limited number are currently available to professional researchers for PS1,900 plus tax and shipping. Iconic British designer Sebastian Conran teamed up with the university's Professor Tony Prescott and Dr Ben Mitchinson to found the company in 2016. The research was supported by Innovate UK and it's received funding as part of an EU project. Ai Build wants to develop robotic technologies to support 3D printing in the built environment. The London startup was born in November 2015 and attracted PS75,000 of seed funding from Seedcamp the next year. Founder Daghan Cam envisions a future of construction in which industrial robotics and machine learning automate fabrication processes and help make large-scale 3D printing affordable. Last October the company unveiled the Daedalus Pavilion to showcase the technology's potential. The 5m high and 4.5m wide structure was built using a customised KUKA robotic arm and a 3D printing gun. Bristol-based Reach Robotics is developing monster robots controlled by mobile devices to use with video games. The company has created more than thirty prototypes since it was launched in 2014, but the first design to be released commercially is MekaMon.  The customisable machines are designed to let players engage in combat through augmented reality gaming and are currently available from $275 (PS224).  Reach Robotics has secured a disclosed total of $250,000 (PS200,575) in seed funding so far from seven different investors. Open Bionics designs 3D-printed bionic hands for amputees using medical grade materials. The open source initiative produces devices that are easily reproduced using off-the-shelf materials and teamed up with Disney in 2015 to create a superhero-themed range of prosthetics for children.  The company has received a total of $120,000 (PS96,270) equity funding and $20,000 (PS16,045) seed funding. In February it added $1 million (PS802,100) in prize money after beating more than 1,000 other entrants to the International UAE Robotics for Good Award. The winnings will be used to push the product through the final stages of medical testing before it can be made available to everyone who needs it. Oxfordshire startup Animal Dynamics emerged as a spinout company from the Department of Zoology at Oxford University that builds bio-inspired vehicles using deep science to understand naturally-evolved designs. The team are working to develop a portfolio of products based on research into flight, swimming and walking in the natural world. The company was co-founded by biomechanics professor Dr Adrian Thomas and entrepreneur Alex Cacciain in 2015, and has attracted seed funding from angel investors Oxford Technology and the University of Oxford Isis Fund (UOIF) to build and test its first products and an undisclosed amount of Series A funding. The creators of Moley Robotics claim to have designed the world's first robotic kitchen. The automated chef is operated by a smartphone and combines the standard kitchen equipment of oven, hob and sink with the unusual addition of two dexterous robotic arms that take care of the cooking. The company has raised a total of $1.17 million (PS939,000) in equity crowdfunding since it was founded in 2014. A prototype of the device won the \"Best of the Best\" award at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Shanghai the next year, and a consumer version is set to launch sometime in 2017, supported by an iTunes-style library of different recipes. Primo Toys are designed to help children learn, play and create with technology. Their first release is a wooden robot called Cubetto that helps teach young children how to code through tactile learning. Cubetto is placed atop a map on a floor mat and the child puts coloured blocks on a board that tell the smiling robot where to go.  The company was founded in 2013 by Matteo Loglio and Filippo Yacob to help kids become creators of technology rather than just consumers. They've attracted a total of $1.18 million (PS950,000) in funding so far, from investors including Randi Zuckerberg, the sister of Facebook founder Mark. Cubetto is currently available to buy for $225 (PS180).  London-based startup Emotech has designed what it bills as \"the first personal robot with individual personality.\" The deep-learning capabilities of the voice-controlled device known as \"Olly\" let it adapt to the personality of its user over time through daily interactions. The technology won the creators four different CES Innovation Awards in 2017. The robotics startup was founded in August 2014 to explore ways of improving the relationships between people and technology and has already secured $10 million (PS8 million) of Series A funding from Alliance Capital and Lightning Capital, plus an undisclosed amount of angel funding. Serial entrepreneur Tom Lipinski developed Q-Bot after he uncovered a problem with laying floor insulation in older homes while working on a previous project aimed at reducing domestic energy use. Q-Bot is his solution. The tiny four-wheeled robot is inserted through an air vent armed with a 3D scanner and insulating foam to survey the underside of floorboards and apply insulation as required. Q-Bot was founded in 2012 and won best startup at the Invention and Entrepreneurship in Robotics and Automation Awards in Seattle in 2015. The system has been trialled with clients including Camden Council and CityWest Homes, and the company claims it can save between PS200 and PS300 a year in energy bills. A total of PS2 million has been invested in Q-Bot from the EU Horizon 2020 Programme and two rounds of seed funding. Starship Technologies develops small self-driving robots designed to deliver goods locally within 30 minutes. The electric six-wheeled personal couriers drive on pavements at a pedestrian speed of four miles per hour to the location of the customer who then unlock the delivery using their personal code. The startup is headquartered in London but its engineering operations are based in Estonia. Skype co-founders Janus Friis and Ahti Heinla created the company in 2015 and have gained $17.2 million (PS13.8 million) of funding from eight investors including HOF Capital and Playfair Capital. Dr Alexander Enoch developed his idea for Robotical while working with bulky machines during his PhD in Robotics studies at the University of Edinburgh. The compact bipedal robot called Marty harnesses the power of play to teach computer skills to children by letting them reprogramme the device and customise its 3D-printed parts. The company has received funding from the the Royal Academy of Engineering's Enterprise Hub and more than PS86,000 on a crowdfunding platform. Marty is currently available at a special pre-order price of PS99 plus shipping. ",

Mad Mimi, while smaller than others listed, is ideal for small/home businesses with a limited but engaged audience. This platform offers users 100 contacts and unlimited email send outs. What's more, Mad Mimi can integrate Google Analytics for real-time reporting. More information on Mad Mimi here. SendBlaster provides free downloadable email software. Unlike the others names in this list, SendBlaster provides a more basic model and can only send 100 emails at one time. It does, however, host over 100 email templates and can be easily upgraded to pro for unlimited emails and contact/database lists.  The one-off fee charged for the upgrade is much lower than that of others so shouldn't be overlooked by smaller businesses that prefer on-premise software. GroupMail and Bigg Mass Mailer are also other good alternatives to this. More information on SendBlaster here. While not free in the traditional sense - meaning it has a free one month trial - Mailjet offers 6000 emails per month, unlimited contacts, real-time tracking and email personalisation. Upgrading isn't too expensive either with packages starting at $7.49 (PS6) per month for a 30,000 monthly email allowance. More information on Mailjet here. Like Mailjet, Constant Contact isn't a totally free product, however, it's listed because it offers a great free trial. For 60 days free users have access to all of Constant Contact's marketing tools (one of the longest trials on the market). Constant Contact provides numerous email templates, a drag and drop editor for customisation and excellent email tracking. The next package up from the trial is $20 (PS16) per month, so it's still a reasonable price for small businesses and startups. More information on Constant contact here. ",

      "content": "Healthtech is a vast sector spanning biotech, life sciences and medtech. A healthtech startup could be developing consumer-facing apps to help book NHS appointments, better technology for clinician workflows or even using machine learning to work through genomics data to boost drug discovery programmes. Back in 2014 the Mayor of London Boris Johnson launched MedCity, a joint programme between academic powerhouses Imperial, Kings College London, UCL, Oxford and Cambridge universities to build a life sciences cluster in the south east of England. At the time Johnson hit upon the diversity of the sector, saying: \"Together with Oxford and Cambridge we form a 'golden triangle' of scientific innovation and we need to channel that intellectual pre-eminence into a positive impact on our economy. MedCity will span everything from research to clinical trials to manufacturing, across biotech, medtech and healthtech.\" The current Mayor Sadiq Khan has also backed healthtech with the digitalhealth.london accelerator scheme, which is currently helping 32 companies design technology solutions for the NHS.  Here are just some of the UK's best healthtech startups to watch... Babylon Health is an app which uses machine learning to connect patients with doctors. You can input your symptoms, upload a photo and it accesses NHS data to set up a phone or video consultation at a time which suits you.  The app also has an AI powered chatbot which allows you to ask medical questions 24/7, a feature which allows you to get prescriptions delivered to your nearest pharmacy. It even doubles up as a health monitoring app which can be synced with your wearable devices. Babylon Health is free but you will be charged for time spent talking to a GP, with unlimited GP access charged at PS5 a month or PS25 per consultation and more for specialist and therapist appointments. Babylon already works with the NHS and raised a $60 million (PS47 million) in funding from NNS holdings, Vostok New Ventures and returned investors Kinnevik AB. This follows a $25 million (PS20 million) round last year led by Swedish investors Kinnevik and including investment from DeepMind co-founders Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman. BenevolentAI is applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to the genomics space, with two business units: Benevolent Bio, which focuses on drug discovery, and BenevolentTech, which is more of a research institution looking at the application of AI to genomic data. The startup's aim is to expedite the traditional drug research process by ingesting huge amounts of data and literature using proprietary algorithms and NVIDIA's DGX-1 deep learning supercomputer. BenevolentAI then builds tools on top to match the workflow of drug discovery scientists so that they can easily mine and interrogate the data, ideally reducing the time to market for important drugs. The existing drug development process can take at least fifteen years, costs upwards of tens of billions of dollars and is high risk, according to BenevolentBio CEO Jackie Hunter. \"Most people in the pharmaceutical industry work on things that never make it to market or even to man,\" she told Techworld.  BenevolentAI is one of the best funded healthtech startups in the UK, bringing in a massive Series A round of PS72 million in a single undisclosed round. Echo is a free app which allows you to order repeat prescriptions to your door. You just tell Echo what prescription you need and where your local GP is. It partners with NHS Digital to plug into the various systems needed to verify these details. It is then delivered to your door by first class Royal Mail, for free. The app reminds you to reorder, when to check in with the GP and even when to take your medicine. So how does it offer all of this for free? Co-founder Stephen Bourke explained to Techworld that Echo essentially works like a \"Deliveroo for prescriptions\", in that it takes a cut of the gross profit a pharmacy makes from the NHS drug tariffs it receives to distribute medicine. Echo has raised a PS1.8 million seed round led by LocalGlobe in November 2016 and was selected for the TechCity UK Upscale programme in January 2017. Launched last year, Thriva sends out a finger-prick blood testing kit which monitors your baseline health and offers lifestyle advice to improve general wellness over time. CEO Hamish Grierson realises the recent debacle of US startup Theranos over-promising what it could test for from a simple finger-prick test may have dented consumer trust in this area, but tells Techworld that Thriva does things differently. \"The first thing is that Theranos are and were trying to develop proprietary testing hardware, so machinery that analyses blood testing, and we are not doing that,\" he said. \"For the reason Theranos encountered around accuracy and trust we are using tried and tested and accepted lab capabilities that the NHS themselves use frequently.\" The baseline test tracks cholesterol, liver function, iron levels and vitamin D and costs PS49 per test, with a recommendation to get tested every three months. The information is then put out to a network of GPs that provide commentary and lifestyle advice which is sent to the user on an online dashboard. \"Thriva is about empowering people to proactively manage their health and make better decisions as a consequence,\" Grierson said. Grierson would like to expand the amount of tests Thriva can run to include urine and DNA. \"We are creating a platform for internal testing. It doesn't really matter what type of biomarker you want to test for we will make it easy and affordable and that's the plan,\" Grierson said. He is also looking to build upon the rich data Thriva is collecting to push predictive insights. Thriva is based in the Huckletree shared working space in Shoreditch and raised an undisclosed funding round in June last year. Andiamo is a startup with an incredibly sad founding story. Naveed and Samiya Parvez came up with the idea following the death of their child Diamo - who had cerebral palsy - in 2012. Diamo's death made the parents spot a gap in the market for tech-enabled orthotics, taking advantage of the lower barriers to entry for 3D printing to produce bespoke braces and orthotics for children.  The startup has got the attention of Sir Richard Branson and is in conversations with the NHS. However Parvez told Techworld in 2015: \"There is not a lack of funding but a lack of imagination. Risk capital is going to iterations of the same ideas with minor tweaks.\" London and New York-based Touch Surgery wants to help train surgeons through a 3D simulation app. The app was created by a group of plastic surgeons who saw a gap in the way the NHS trained surgeons that would be more cost effective than using cadavers. The app gives trainees simulated surgeries from which they can learn and practice as well as tips, advice and feedback. It is already being used by medical students at Imperial College London. Touch Surgery raised a $1 million (PS800,000) seed round led by Episode 1 in 2014. iamYiam is a UK healthtech startup founded by former venture capitalist Lorena Puica after she developed a thyroid condition and wanted to promote a more preventative approach to healthcare. You start by taking a saliva DNA test from Xcode, which is sent in the post. This tests for forty parameters and \"enable us to understand how you process nutrients, respond to certain activities, any pre-disposition to diabetes or slow metabolism\", says Puica. The iamYiam algorithms then match you to therapists and a personalised nutritional plan. Puica says she wants to do more machine learning work on the patient data they collect to improve the matching algorithms and better predict effective healthcare plans. The startup is focusing on attracting corporate clients and has raised angel investment so far with a PS2 million round planned for this year, with Puica's ex-employer Octopus Investments involved. Vida is a home care service which uses technology to match carers to patients and deliver personalised care programmes. You start by setting up a care assessment through the Vida website, after which its algorithms will align the patient's needs to carer skills. The carer will then provide a personalised care plan for a flat fee of PS15 per hour of care. Founder Naushard Jabir is a former mergers and acquisitions analyst turned entrepreneur that started Vida in May 2016. Vida already has a spot contract with the Kingston local authority and a spokesperson for the startup told Techworld: \"We're speaking with a number of other local councils throughout London\". Vida is currently funded by an unnamed group of angel investors. Founded in 2012, Umotif focuses on bringing high quality patient data to doctors and clinical researchers. For patients Umotif is a way of capturing timely and accurate symptom, medication and wearable data in an engaging mobile app format. So as opposed to unreliable paper diaries or weekly appointments with the doctor it is bringing more timely data into the equation, which will improve patient care and data quality for researchers. For doctors and clinical researchers it is a white label Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product, providing a secure patient data source which is accessible through a web portal, complete with dashboards. All data is HIPAA (USA) and Information Governance (UK) compliant and is stored in the cloud with AWS. The startup has raised some seed capital previously and has already had its services procured by NHS Digital and major pharmaceutical companies. It is working with a number of hospitals and clinical trials, such as the recent successful trial for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Doctify, similar to Babylon Health, is a healthcare platform that allows patients to search, compare and book appointments with specialists across 47 medical areas, and includes reviews from other users. The startup was launched by two practicing NHS doctors: Dr Stephanie Eltz and Dr Suman Saha. Doctify raised an undisclosed Series A round led by Amadeus Capital Partners in October 2016. Conceived by Cambridge graduates Victor Dillard and Edward Perello in 2012, Desktop Genetics aims to help people interrogate the CRISPR genomics database, using artificial intelligence (AI) to simplify the process for researchers. Desktop Genetics' Deskgen cloud platform essentially guides researchers through the genome editing process. There are also CRISPR libraries for advanced users. The startup has raised $3.2 million (PS2.6 million) to date from a variety of investors. Big Health is targeting mental health with its \"digital medicine\" non-drug programmes, starting with its first solution, the online app Sleepio. Sleep is a good indicator of mental health and the app starts by monitoring sleep patterns, provides a sleep score and delivers guides to improvement. For certain cases Sleepio will recommend Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, tailored to each individual's needs by a virtual expert. Big Health works with employers to improve the general mental health of employees, including media company Comcast and LinkedIn. The startup also has a research arm looking into mental health issues. Big Health was founded by Colin Espie, a professor of sleep medicine at Oxford University and NHS innovation fellow Peter Hames. It has good investor pedigree too, raising $15.3 million (PS12.4 million) to date led by Index Ventures in Series A and Octopus Ventures in Series B. Health Unlocked is an online community for people to share their health experiences with others, ask for advice and receive support. Instead of those terrifying Google results, users can ask real people that have suffered from certain illnesses questions and receive useful advice. Popular groups include anxiety support and lifestyle changes, for example smokers looking to quit, running and weight loss communities. The startup describes itself as the social network for health, with more than 600,000 members and 40 million visits a year. The startup partners with patient advocacy organisations, providing them with access to its audience and also offers a range of commercial services, including patient insights. Health Unlocked is part of the NHS Innovation Accelerator programme. Founded in 2010 by Pablo Graiver, Dr. Jessica Mann and Dr. Eithan Ephrati, Antidote is a platform for connecting patients with medical researchers. You simply input information (condition, location, age, sex) and Antidote will suggest clinical trials that you can participate in. Researchers get access to more patients, accelerating their research. Antidote has taken clinical trail information and made it machine readable, allowing the startup to better match patients to the right trials using its algorithms. Antidote has raised $17.9 million (PS14.3m) to date, led by Amadeus Capital Partners (Seed $1.25m); Octopus Ventures (Series A $3.2m); Smedvig Capital (Series B $13.5m). Cambridge-based DuoFertility is combining software and hardware to help couples to conceive. The startup combines a mobile app with a small wearable sensor which monitors ovulation. Using customer data, DuoFertility's algorithms learn about fertility cycles and help identify fertility windows up to ten days ahead of time. The startup will pair you off with a fertility expert to provide a personalised support plan according to your data. Three months of the service will set you back PS359.99 for three months, which includes a consultation and the sensor. The DuoFertility maker Sensiia has received around $9 million (PS7.2 million) in total funding to date, with the most recent round in 2014 led by Longwall Venture Partners. ",

      "content": "The UK events sector is worth about PS40 billion a year, but it is still a remarkably traditional 'offline' industry based on relationships between individuals. That's something one startup is slowly starting to change. Hire Space, an online marketplace for venues, was launched three years ago by two friends: Edward Poland and Will Swannell. Neither had any experience in events or venues. Swannell was a secondary school teacher and Poland worked for an MP. The idea came to Swannell when he realised how many schools sit empty after hours. The startup was originally conceived as a way to help underused public sector buildings, struggling with austerity, to bring in another revenue stream, Poland tells Techworld. It has since become far wider in scope, with 5,000 venues across the UK listed and another 100 added every month. The site hosts an eclectic mix of spaces from the London Eye and the Olympic Velodrome to Hampton Court Palace and Shakespeare's Globe. The startup employs 40 staff and the majority of its users work in the professional events business organising conferences, parties, weddings and meetings, according to Poland. \"We have an incredible team. They could run the business. And they free me up to have the luxury of thinking about big strategic questions,\" he says.  \"We wanted it to be a transactional platform letting people book a venue in a few clicks. We wanted it to be website first,\" he explains. The company has now raised PS2.5 million in total, including PS500,000 from crowdfunding platform Crowdcube and early angel investment from Karen Hanton, founder of restaurant booker TopTable. Hire Space is free for users but takes commission from venues (apart from public sector spaces, which are allowed to list for free).   Poland hopes Hire Space's data might help provide insights into the events industry. \"Last year we had about 25,000 enquiries and 4.5 million page views on the site. That's great insight, so we will release a report based on the data,\" he says. \"We are very new to this sector. Our competitors' main reaction has been to be baffled, confused or fearful,\" Poland adds. The company's relative youth is no bar to ambition however. Looking ahead, Poland says he is considering expanding overseas and growing the range of services offered. \"There is enormous potential for Hire Space. We get people at the start of the event planning cycle. We could even become a full events marketplace. We're in a position where we are thinking about what's next,\" he says. ",

      "content": "Brolly may have only graduated from incubator Entrepreneur First in September, but this startup already has ambitious plans to give customers a single place to view, manage and buy insurance from their mobile. To really shake up an industry rife with inertia and outdated products Phoebe Hugh, cofounder and CEO at Brolly, aims to go back to the days where your insurance broker knew what you needed and helped you to manage an insurance portfolio, before the days of price comparison sites and online portals. Instead of connecting you with a human broker though, Brolly uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Hugh, a psychology graduate from the University of Manchester, left her job at insurance giant Aviva in March 2015 and enrolled in the prestigious Entrepreneur First programme, joining the sixth cohort a year later in March 2016. There she met her cofounder, CTO Mykhailo Loginov. She had become jaded by an industry that only ever seemed to \"unlock a whole host of frustrations\" in customers, and which had not yet produced a successful new consumer brand or startup focusing on doing things differently.  Hugh explained that before the internet all insurance was managed by brokers \"who would manage everything\". \"The products haven't changed. So people end up not getting advice anymore, they are trying to figure stuff out and end up under insured or buy stuff they don't need.\" In short: management of insurance policies has become fatally fragmented, \"so there is no portfolio visually. Everything comes through your email or paper or an online portal, there is no join up,\" she told Techworld. \"The biggest issue that results from that is inertia, so you end up leaving things and you end up paying double, because you aren't rewarded for loyalty, you are reprimanded. This is characteristic of how the market is today and what we wanted to do at Brolly was cut through that.\" The first step was getting an app off the ground. This soon became three interlocking products, all housed in the Brolly app. In Hugh's words: \"The app originally was designed to focus on the biggest issues consumers were facing, and we grouped them into: understanding insurance, managing insurance and buying insurance.\" These became the Brolly Advisor, Locker and Shop.  With the advisor Hugh wanted \"to create an advisor which based on what you put in you get valuable output to help you understand where you might have gaps in cover\". In practice you provide the app with information such as lifestyle and financial attributes, and then give the app access to your inbox so that it can scrape your existing policy documents into the locker. Now the algorithm takes over and \"spots where you have gaps, like income protection insurance, explains what it is and asks would you like to get a quote?\" The locker is \"the hub, it's where customers manage everything they have and anything they buy goes in there and anything that isn't they can be advised on\". In the locker customers can access documents, contact providers, see how much they are paying and upcoming renewal dates. Any gaps can be advised upon and then, once it comes online later this year, products can be bought in the shop. The last piece of the puzzle is the shop, which Hugh says is the most demanded feature. It is currently being tested with beta customers and is set to become available to the public in the summer. Brolly will start by offering home, motor and travel, with more product lines to come. Hugh wants the shop to be \"extremely fast and fully self service, so a couple of taps to get your policy. It is about convenience, there is not a huge focus on getting the cheapest policy, it is more customers that value quality products and want a fast way to buy something outright\". The shop will also learn more about you and even \"if they don't need a quote today it gives us the ability to look around in the background to push notifications to the user to suggest the best time to switch, so it is trying to be that proactive advisor in someone's pocket,\" Hugh summarised. Brolly will take a commission on any products it sells through the app and the insurance providers in exchange get access to high quality customers, according to Hugh. \"Due to the relationship we are building with our customers we really have a deep understanding of their lives, we know this homeowner has two cars and children and likes to travel and it is delivering an entire holistic person and insurers see tremendous value in being able to tap into good quality risk and stripping out fraud,\" she said. This personal profile isn't handed over to the insurer but is anonymised. Hugh explained: \"Pricing today is focused on product lines not the individual, and it is using actuarial models rather than holistic pictures of people. \"So an actuarial model for the entire customer base whereas we use machine learning techniques to get right down to personalised risk models. That is where the value of our data lies.\" She added the Brolly platform is poised to incorporate data from wearable devices and car telematics in the future too. Insurtech is set for a bumper year, with KPMG already predicting that 2017 is the year the nascent industry will \"come into its own\". If Brolly is going to take advantage of this it will need to get the shop up and running and ramp up customer acquisition. Hugh is already looking at the ways UK challenger banks have taken a transparent, community-first approach to get early adopters on board. Brolly will almost certainly have to contend with a raft of imitators soon enough. To date Hugh believes that most startups have focused on smaller pieces of the puzzle than an all-in-one solution. The question will be if Brolly has bitten off more than it can chew. \n\n\n\n(function(){\nvar params = {};\nwindow.setupVideoCustomParams = function(){\nif(typeof window.pageVideoCustomParams !== 'undefined'){\nreturn;\n}\nvar pubAds = googletag.pubads();\nfor(var prop in pubAds){\nif(prop.length===1 && Object.prototype.toString.call(pubAds[prop]) === \"[object Object]\" ){ //why not use typeof??\nvar adsAttrObj = pubAds[prop];\nif(\"URL\" in adsAttrObj){\nfor (var key in adsAttrObj) {\nswitch (key) {\ncase \"pcat1\":\ncase \"pcat2\":\ncase \"pcat3\":\ncase \"kw\":\ncase \"artid\":\nparams['video-'+key] = adsAttrObj[key];\nbreak;\ncase \"chan\":\nparams['video-channel'] = adsAttrObj[key];\nbreak;\n}\n}\nbreak;\n}\n}\n}\nwindow.pageVideoCustomParams = params;\n}\ngoogletag.cmd.push(setupVideoCustomParams);\n})();\nrequire(['jquery', 'jwplayer'], function($,jwplayer){\nif (typeof window.jwplayer === 'undefined') {\nwindow.jwplayer = jwplayer;\n}\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function(){\nvar timestamp = new Date().getTime(),\nadvertisingTag = \"\" + adConfig.zone + \"&sz=640x480&ciu_szs=&unviewed_position_start=1&output=xml_vast2&impl=s&env=vp&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=0&vad_type=linear&vpos=preroll&pod=1&min_ad_duration=0&max_ad_duration=30000&ppos=1&\",\ncust_params = {\n\"playertype\": 'clicktoplay',\n\"video-id\": \"3656945\",\n\"stg\": \"false\"\n};\nif(typeof window.pageVideoCustomParams === 'undefined'){\nwindow.setupVideoCustomParams();\n}\n$.extend(cust_params, window.pageVideoCustomParams);\nvar cust_params_url = '';\nvar prevQuality;\nfor(var paramKey in cust_params){\nvar paramValue = cust_params[paramKey],\ndelimiter = cust_params_url.length > 0 ?

      "content": "Canary Wharf has a chequered past. It went from being one of the busiest docks in the world to being deserted by 1980, before reinvention as a business district, with the first buildings completed in 1991. The construction company then promptly went bankrupt and in December 1995 an international consortium bought the scheme. That consortium became the Canary Wharf Group. It is this PS5 billion company that owns Level39, Europe's largest technology accelerator, located on the 39th floor of One Canada Square (it has since expanded to include levels 24 and 42). Level39 opened in March 2013 and has since grown to house more than 200 startups with about 900 people between them, according to Ben Brabyn, who took over the reins in February 2016. He was previously COO of UKTI's 'Innovation Gateway', having worked with JP Morgan after a stint as a captain in the Royal Marines.  The accelerator doesn't take equity in any of the companies it hosts. It offers membership packages for desks, meeting rooms and other amenities starting from PS325 a month.  It's clearly a model that's working: a brief tour reveals rooms packed with people typing into laptops, taking calls, holding meetings and getting coffee. It's a hive of activity. \"We don't have time limits, a deadline or a demo day. We don't take equity or behave like investors. We treat all as best we can, with the same price for a desk for everyone. We are not picking winners,\" Brabyn tells Techworld. The accelerator has a wide variety of specialisms, including fintech, cyber security, smart cities and retail tech. \"We're more a meta accelerator really, we don't do any one thing - and we host a lot of others' accelerators, including UBS, Accenture, EY and Silk Ventures, who are helping the Chinese to engage here. Increasingly we are a team of teams, a host of centres of excellence rather than one in our own right,\" he adds. Level39's genesis lies in the 2008 financial crash. \"There's been a focus on diversification [beyond solely the finance sector] in Canary Wharf since then, led by Sir George Iacobescu [CEO of Canary Wharf Group],\" he says. Of the 120,000 people that work in the area, less than half of them now work in finance, compared to 80 percent in 2010, according to Brabyn. Level39 is part of this wider push to diversify Canary Wharf, and to try to provide more support for earlier stage companies, not just the vast multinationals that the area is so famous for. \"Within five minutes from here we've got 30 percent of banks' IT budgets. We can provide access to customers, capital, talent, regulators and government bodies, and deep sectoral knowledge,\" Brabyn enthuses. There is also a growing academic presence: UCL has moved its School of Management postgraduate programme onto the 38th floor below, for example. Of the startups within Level39, the soaraway success is Digital Shadows, a cyber security company with 75 employees which works with big names like the NSA and the Bank of England, and has offices in the US as well as UK. However there is a dizzying array of early-stage companies based there: Revolut, dopay, MapR, OpenCorporates, Coinjar, DigitalGenius and Credits, to name but a tiny few.  Looking ahead to 2017, Brabyn says his focus will be on ensuring access to talent post-Brexit and international expansion.   \"Level39 is scaling up now. We're taking over three floors. We're going from a startup to a scale up ourselves,\" Brabyn says. On that ever-present topic, Brexit, Brabyn refuses to be downbeat. He approaches the topic in as upbeat a manner as everything else: \"Let's focus on what we can do, not what we can't\", he says.  ",

      "content": "As more and more shoppers purchase their clothes online the fashion industry is having to adopt technology at a faster rate than ever. These eight startups are bringing big data analytics, facial recognition and 3D technologies together with retailers to help you shop and dress better. Lyst is an e-commerce platform that brings together more than 11,000 fashion brands and retailers, allowing shoppers to use a single shopping basket, instead of clicking out to each individual retailer's websites. So how does it differ to an e-commerce site like ASOS? PR manager Katy Lubin told Techworld:  \"Scale and size, we have more stuff than anyone else with over three million products from 11,000+ brands and retailers. Insight, we have a data science and analytics team that are looking at 4.5 million changing data points every hour, such as new products dropping, new stock, changes in pricing etcetera, which give us the ability to build up a picture of how the world is shopping in real time. Lastly authority, we work with all of the best partners around the world, such as Saks in the USA and Selfridges here in London.\" Lyst is one of the better established names on this list (no pun intended), featuring in TechcityUK's Future 50 and it has already pulled in more than PS42 million in funding from the likes of Groupe Arnault, Accel Partners and Balderton Capital. Kieran O'Neill founded Thread in 2012 with the aim of helping men dress better through combining personal online stylists with big data insights. You start out by telling the platform some of your fashion preferences (do you wear skinny jeans or bootcut) and how much you tend to spend on clothes, what size you wear and some of your favourite brands and some outfits you like. You are then assigned a personal stylist (shout out to my stylist Sophie Gaten) who reviews the preferences and emails you a list of suggested items. Thread currently has eight stylists working in house for its 250,000 active users, with one stylist in particular having 45,000 clients. If this seems like an untenable workload that is where the technology comes in. Founder and CEO Kieran O'Neill told Techworld: \"It's a combination of the stylist and the algorithm.\" Once the stylist has sent over the first set of recommendations the Thread algorithm starts to work, learning which items you like and dismiss before sending out weekly recommendations. This frees up stylist's time to concentrate on the initial taste profiles and the human actions of messaging, so you can even ask your stylist what she would recommend you wear to a wedding this summer. Thread is a free service which makes its money by working directly with big fashion brands, clustering orders at wholesale rates before selling and shipping items itself. Thread has raised more than PS7 million from seed and series A funding, with Balderton Capital the lead investor. Metail is a London-based startup founded by Cambridge graduate Tom Adeyoola. It is applying computer vision technology to various problems the fashion retail sector faces, from digitisation of garments and photography to the elusive virtual fitting room for ecommerce sites.  Its main consumer product is the MeModel, which is a virtual version of you built simply using measurements which can be dressed in garments from partner retailers. The startup wants to digitise the world's garments by using \"software to deform and warp garments based not just on how it changes shape but the underlying shape of the person under the garment,\" according to Adeyoola. Most recently Metail has announced its Composed Photography solution. This leverages its garment digitisation expertise to essentially deliver all the onsite model photography a retailer needs at far lower prices than existing outsourcing providers. Metail has raised nearly $20 million (PS16 million) to date from New World Private Equity and angel investors. It is currently planning a Series C round which will likely be led by strategic Asian investors. Wearable technology is still in it's infancy, and although smartwatches and fitness trackers are growing in popularity, they are still a way off in terms of aesthetics and subtlety. London-based startup Vinaya is a wearable technology company that recently launched its Altruis range (from PS220-275) of women's jewellery that connects with your devices to push custom notifications via subtle vibrations to a ring, necklace or bracelet. Vinaya has an ambitious design lab which is hoping to produce wearables that help re-balance our growing addiction to technology by adjusting to users moods and habits and dialling down notifications where appropriate. Founder Kate Unsworth told TechCrunch that the plan is to apply data-analysis to: \"Brain activity and psychology to try to understand how people are feeling -- and as a result of that the types of products that we can build to help them feel better.\" Eileen Burbidge of Passion Capital led on Vinaya's seed funding round of $3m (PS2.1m) in November 2015. Farfetch is a platform that brings together more than 300 high-end, independent fashion boutiques from across the world to a single shopping basket. Meaning you can shop for niche pieces from Italian boutiques from your trendy flat in Shoreditch. The only unicorn on this list (valued at more than $1 billion), Farfetch completed a huge funding round in March 2015, raising more than $194m (PS137m) from investors that includes fashion publishing giant Conde Nast International. Even e-commerce giant ASOS never reached a $1b valuation pre-IPO. Have you ever wanted to ask someone on the tube where they got their shoes from? No, just us then? Regardless, if you see an item you want to own but don't want to ask the person, simply snap a sneaky picture on your smartphone and use Snap Fashion to identify similar items from hundreds of UK retailers. You can then make the purchase through Snap Fashion, either in your browser or using the mobile app. Snap Fashion founder Jenny Griffiths received an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list last year before she even turned 30. Griffiths has already won the Decoded Fashion startup pitch, and first place at Cisco's BIG awards in 2012. Snap Fashion has raised an undisclosed amount during seed and series A funding rounds from investors Venrex Investment Management and Time Inc, respectively. Pocket High Street was born to support the little guy, the small retailers that struggle to compete with big e-commerce sites. The idea was to provide a quality online platform for shoppers to discover small retailers. The London-based startup provides an open platform which connects to major inventory systems, so that small shops can reach a larger audience and offer a click and collect delivery option. Pocket High Street has raised an undisclosed amount during a seed funding round so far. A fashion startup that is truly embracing cutting edge technology is Holition, which looks to help brands and retailers embrace 3D technology and augmented reality. Their latest product is where it gets really interesting though. Face allows cosmetics brands to show how their products look on shoppers without applying any product. Using 3D technology a smartphone or tablet can act as a virtual mirror. The possibilities for this sort of technology in the fashion and retail spaces are pretty intriguing. Holition already boasts Louis Vuitton, Tag Heuer, Lacoste and even fellow startup Lyst as clients. As shoppers continue to flock online, fashion brands are looking for ways to confront the problem of virtual fittings. Fits.me is basically a virtual reality changing room. It works by building a 3D model of shoppers so that they can try clothes on virtually. Fits.me claims to be able to model to a level of accuracy that accounts for clothes \"measurements, design intentions, grading rules and stretch factors\". This also opens up opportunities for retailers to send recommendations not just dependant on taste but also fit. Fits.me has raised PS9.2m in funding so far and was acquired by Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten in July, but will continue to operate out of London. Their services are currently only available on a bespoke basis. Shirt-makers TM Lewin, Hawes & Curtis and Thomas Pink are amongst the first clients of Fits.me. ",

      "content": "As an economics student at Cambridge University Tom Adeyoola knew as much about card counting at the Blackjack table as he did about garment supply chains. In short: nothing. However, over the past eight years Adeyoola has gone from building online blackjack games to 3D modelling clothes and consumers. The connective tissue is computer vision technology - where computers can learn to recognise objects in digital images. Speaking from their London office in a redeveloped Victorian wool warehouse in Whitechapel, Tom Adeyoola, founder of the startup Metail, and his CTO Jim Downing explained how the business developed its underlying computer vision technology and how they plan to commercialise it in 2017.  In 2007 Adeyoola was sitting in his hotel room in Macau trying to solve a work problem: how to take advantage of looser rules around online gambling thanks to the Gambling Act of 2005 and create a live blackjack game for his employer Inspired Gaming Group. He wanted to create a game \"where you could have players or machines playing against a live table\", he said, \"and the way to solve that was by looking up and using cameras to recognise cards being dealt live in the casino\". The next step took a leap of faith. Adeyoola Googled 'leading expert in computer vision' and found Professor Roberto Cipolla at Jesus College, Cambridge. \"So I cold called him from my hotel room in Hong Kong. I asked him how easy it would be to create this system from scratch and he said 'no problem, come to my lab'.\" Cipolla introduced Adeyoola to one of his ex-PhD students: Duncan Robertson, whom he commissioned to build a proof of concept for this gaming system. The experience proved to the young entrepreneur that he was able to take a concept through to completion, and he started to set his sights on his own project. After months of soul searching he settled on online clothes shopping, an experience he calls \"emotionally draining\". He asked himself: \"Could I do that through creating a 3D virtual you?\" and saw a range of external signals that the timing was right: the growth of online retailers like ASOS, broadband penetration, the growing maturity of computer vision and cloud services. \"I felt that people had failed to solve the hard problems,\" he told Techworld. \"People tended to stick to the data side. So tell us loads of data about yourself and we will match you to clothes, and that was very onerous on the consumer. I didn't feel that was a way to get mass adoption. It needed to be easy.\"  Adeyoola says most of the retailers he spoke to had been burned in the past trying to find a workable solution, and had set their sights lower, opting to just take on size advice rather than providing a 3D visual of the consumer. \"For me it felt like you needed the visual to get a sense of getting something back from the user for asking them for the information,\" he said. So the Metail team worked away at its core MeModel consumer application, looking for ways to improve the accuracy of visuals in order to drive adoption rates. The startup went from asking consumers to arduously submit photos of themselves to simply working from measurements. \"We established that by using height, weight and bra size, and then adding in hips and waist, you can get the accuracy level we were getting from a photo and deliver a visualisation in under ten seconds, which is key.\"  Metail will be bringing photos back though to allow users to increase the accuracy of their model. \"Now people are moving to mobile we have gone mobile first and we will start to allow users to do more to increase the accuracy of their model.\" The CTO Jim Downing has also been working on deep learning algorithms to apply to user submitted photos. He explained: \"Where we used to fall down was users submitting Facebook pictures as it was all they had. So with deep learning we could make it more robust to those inputs. It will be able to work out what the pose was and which bits of the body it is seeing.\" Next Adeyoola turned his attention to digitising clothing items, and found the main stumbling block was cost. \"No one had been able to digitise clothing for cheaper than $300-400 per garment, so it was absurdly expensive.\" Adeyoola wanted to get that figure down to $3 per garment, and he turned to Duncan Robertson again to solve it \"because I felt the technology direction I needed to go in was computer vision\". The eventual solution was to simplify the process by digitising garments in 2.5 dimensions instead of 3D. Adeyoola explained: \"So starting with a sample we digitise against ground truth, which is a mannequin, and then based on the standard elements of how the garment changes into different sizes we use software to deform and warp that garment based not just on how it changes shape but the underlying shape of the person under the garment.\" So now Metail had to ensure that both the underlying MeModel and the overlying garment interacted correctly, and at speeds that wouldn't put users off. Before cloud providers like AWS allowed startups to specify the number of graphics processing units (GPUs) they wanted to use a company like Metail had to do everything on its own servers. \"So we had to build our own virtualised server farm of Mac minis, which was the best bang for your buck graphics processing unit on the market. Now you can specific GPUs in AWS and that has changed things a lot.\" And the cost? \"Now we are at $10 and have the R&D to get down to $3 and push those boundaries,\" Adeyoola said. \"Because we have gone out and made the process of digitising garments so cheap our big focus is digitising the world's garments. So we did 40,000 last year and want to do 100-200,000 this year.\" This approach led to a new revenue stream of its own. \"So this autumn we have a product called Composed Photography which is leveraging our digitisation expertise to deliver all of the onsite model garment photography a retailer needs at considerably less cost, increased flexibility and increase efficiency,\" Adeyoola said. Metail would essentially become the photography department for a retailer, using its warping software to reduce the amount of photos required to digitise a garment. \"So we needed to be able to do the photography in a way that we supply some sort of rig to go into their supply chain,\" he explained. \"So it could be operated where the garments are, because the samples are gold dust and that is where you need to do the photography.\"  Downing added that the breakthrough came when they realised \"that we didn't need a person behind the camera with a standard set of settings. The idea that by using computer vision you could still get good results was controversial at the time.\" The focus was on making it easy and simple enough to be operated by low cost labour. So for a one dollar labour cost per garment all of those images are sent to the cloud and processed by Metail. This allows retailers to shoot a model once and the collection on a mannequin and the software layers all of the items onto the model. Cutting recurring photography drastically and doing a lot of work in software potentially allows retailers to cut spending on models and focus on hiring superstar brand ambassador they only have to shoot once. So instead of having a stable of ten models, a brand could hire one Cara Delevingne. This also gives the startup a platform for selling in its value added services into retail customers, like the MeModel from which is takes a revenue share on all sold items. Eventually Adeyoola wants Metail to \"be wherever anyone is having a conversation about fashion\". What he means is, by digitising the world's garments a user could be reading Vogue magazine, scan the dress and see it on the MeModel, share it on Facebook and buy it on Amazon, all from their phone. Then there is the growing data side of the business. By having detailed data on what does and doesn't fit, and where users are abandoning items on their MeModel the startup's data could potentially enrich retailer's recommendation engines, or automate returns information to improve size recommendations on the back end. \"As we see garments as we shoot we can use deep learning and computer vision to apply attributes to those garments.\" So take a brand new jacket and Metail could use the metadata to liken it to an older item and pair it with similar recommended outfits as it did before. This is particularly powerful when you pair it with data around a user's body shape.  Adeyoola has high hopes for Metail in 2017, pushing towards greater commercialisation, especially in a UK market which has been tougher to break than Asia. He says that, regardless of the growth potential of Asia, breaking into your home market is important, if not simply for morale, and that one of the leading UK retailers is starting a trial next month. Metail has raised nearly $20 million (PS16 million) to date from New World Private Equity and angel investors. It is currently planning a Series C round which will likely be led by strategic Asian investors. ",

      "content": "The business of banks relies on keeping savings safe, but hackers are finding ever more sophisticated methods to access them. Swindlers stole PS755 million across payment cards, remote banking and cheques in 2015 according to Financial Fraud Action UK, an increase of 26 per cent compared to 2014. The declining cost of technology iss lowering the barriers to entry for budding fraudsters, while emerging technologies give them new methods of theft. However the banking sector is developing solutions to match them. BT showed Techworld some future security solutions at its Adastral Park research centre in Suffolk. Cryptographic protection for real-time banking transactions today relies on mathematical equations that are normally sufficient for our computation powers. Contemporary encryption keys are often changed intermittently, as constant changes can be a major inconvenience for everyone involved. \"That's fine the way it is\", says BT lead consultant Ian Monteath, \"because these keys would take the age of the universe to crack.\" The rise of quantum computing introduces a disturbing threat to the way things are. Its vast computing power means encryption could be broken in a relatively short amount of time. Help is at hand for the security teams of the future. Quantum key distribution developed by BT and Toshiba can mitigate the threat by exploiting the laws of physics to make data encryption almost unbreakable. Encrypted data is transferred through the quantum key distribution system (left) and monitored by the eavesdropping device Encoded information is fired down optical fibre in single photons of light at a rate of up ten gigabits per second. Keys can be checked every millisecond if required, so a quantum computer has to crack potentially trillions of keys in order to access a meaningful volume of data. An eavesdropping device monitors any evidence of interruption creeping into the transmission on a tapping meter, which is reflected in the time of its arrival.   The laws of quantum physics dictate that you could change anything in the quantum world just by observing it. \"That's what makes this look like an ideal way of transferring keys,\" says Monteath. \"Anybody that tries to break and have a look at the data, they essentially start to corrupt the data.\" Any breach is identified immediately and the transaction aborted to avoid disaster. Because it can exchange data at such a high rate, an uncompromised key can still be used from the catalogue that's been stockpiled, and a new key can be sent automatically with no noticeable disruption. On the counter of the BT's model high street bank branch stands a Fujitsu biometric palm reader that can verify the identity of customer with a touch of the hand. Monteath places his palm above the device and it scans the veins underneath the surface of his skin by emitting an infrared beam sensitive to light reflected off haemoglobin in his blood. The pattern is recorded by the sensor and compared to his record on a database before access is granted. \"There's another technology which uses fingers, which are much more prone to constriction in the cold conditions,\" says Monteath. \"The reason they went for the palm in this instance was the depth of the veins within the palm are sufficient, and they don't tend to constrict as much as the ones on your fingers.\" A further form of biometrics is also on display. The facial biometric recognition tool known developed by a startup called Iproov can authenticate identity through a smartphone camera.  Monteath positions within a circle on the smartphone screen before a sequence of colours flash light across on the details of his face. Most similar devices only analyse an image, but this one goes a step further by streaming a video to the servers. Using a photo wouldn't work as it wouldn't reflect the light off his features in the same three dimensional way. It may be possibility to deceive by making a first-rate bust, but only if it's of a quality that few are capable of creating. \"It has to be Hollywood-grade prosthetics,\" says Monteath. \"It has to be that good before you've even got a change of it working.\" ",

      "content": "MIT spinout startup Humanyze supplies biometric badges and accompanying software to companies wanting to track their staff. The five-year-old company is starting to make inroads into the UK market. Techworld spoke to the CEO Ben Waber about what organisations can learn about their staff using biometric tracking, and how to deal with the privacy concerns raised. Humanyze badges look like a normal employee ID badge but are equipped with radio-frequency identification (RFID) and near field communication (NFC) sensors, bluetooth for proximity sensing, infrared to detect face to face interaction, an accelerometer and two microphones.  The badges 'talk' to beacons set up around the office to detect proximity. The microphones, which seem inescapably creepy, \"don't record what you say but [the microphones perform] voice processing,\" Waber explained. \"So how much you talk, do you dominate conversations? Tone, volume, speed.\" Waber says all the data is processed in real time and nothing is recorded. It is processed in the cloud and distributed to the relevant employee and managers get an aggregated, anonymised view of their teams. The company combines this physical world data with data from work systems (primarily Microsoft) to pull calendar and email usage data (not content, it says). By combining digital communications data with data from the physical world managers can use Humanyze dashboards to get a \"holistic view of what goes on in the company\", Waber says. Managers can start to see how they spread their time between people, how different teams talk to one another, if meetings are inclusive enough and how cohesive groups are. Waber says that managers can use this aggregated data to see \"what top performers do that others don't? You can test how you manage the business, A/B test different [office] layouts before implementing them.\" Waber says the overall aim is \"quantifying the value of employees having coffee together in the age of of working from home.\" Employees can also access their own personal dashboards to see \"what you do, how you compare to the team average. If you want a different role you can look at what they do. You can start to see how you compare, so benchmarking within your company,\" he said. Concerns over workplace monitoring and biometrics came to a head last year when Daily Telegraph journalists objected to their desk time being monitored. The main issue here was around consent. According to Buzzfeed the staff were not asked for consent to be monitored at their desk and only discovered what the devices were after \"googling the brand name and discovered they were wireless motion detectors produced by a company called OccupEye that monitor whether individuals are using their desks\". In the UK, Citizens Advice states: \"Your employer can legally monitor your use of the phone, internet, email or fax in the workplace if: the monitoring relates to the business; the equipment being monitored is provided partly or wholly for work; and your employer has made all reasonable efforts to inform you that your communications will be monitored.\" However, \"some employers monitor their workers without informing them that this is happening, for example, by use of hidden cameras or audio devices. This is very rarely legal.\" Waber says that he thinks these sorts of laws and regulations are out of step with this next phase of physical, biometric tracking in the workplace though. \"You need government regulation on this to ensure that people opt in for this stuff,\" he said. Waber is naturally keen to avoid this kind of reaction to his technology. So, when an organisation contracts Humanyze they will come into the office to brief staff on how the system works and what is, and isn't, recorded. Everyone signs a disclaimer and there is no obligation to take part. When asked if not taking part could be damaging from a career perspective, in other words, that by even asking employees to take part you are applying implicit pressure, Waber didn't miss a beat: \"If you tried to force people you would have a negative impact on the workforce that counteracts any positive effect the tech has,\" he said. Furthermore, employees that don't want to participate can wear a \"fake\" badge, however he says that generally Humanyze gets 90 percent participation, \"so we are generally quite good at communicating the value of this and make sure we do it the right way,\" he said. Transparency will be key to adoption of this sort of technology. Waber is unhappy with the tabloid (and broadsheet) press coverage Humanyze has been getting in the UK so far, where they tend to exaggerate the privacy concerns. For example, a piece by The Mirror about the company leads with the entirely misleading headline: \"Your boss could track you day AND night using new smart technology.\" Waber laughed off the headlines, saying that being able to track employees day and night would not only be wrong on a moral level -- \"from a privacy perspective it is the wrong thing to do,\" he said -- but on a business level too. As he said, trust is vital to Humanyze when it comes to attracting new customers. \"Any potential value of that information would be dwarfed by the legitimate negative reaction that people would have,\" he explained. In terms of the UK market Waber admits that uptake has been slower than in the US and Japan but he is \"seeing uptake in healthcare and financial services\". However he wouldn't be pushed on which companies are using its services. ",

      "content": "Dubbed the 'Uber of events', TickX pulls over 70,000 events from over 30 ticket sellers. The app compares gig, theatre, sports, club night, comedy and festival ticket prices on one site and smartphone app. \"If someone's thinking of a ticket seller we want them to think TickX. We want to be the one-stop shop for event goers,\" TickX cofounder Steve Pearce tells Techworld. In the last 12 months operations have gone from strength to strength for founders Sam Coley and Steve Pearce, with TickX.co.uk reaching 100,000 monthly active users and its revenues growing 40 percent month on month. Not to mention appearing on BBC's Dragon's Den. After interviewing cofounder Steve Pearce this time last year, Techworld caught up with Pearce again to discuss what's happened over the last 12 months. See also: Meet TickX: the ticket comparison startup using Skyscanner's winning formula. \"We've worked hard and have grown the team. We've brought Tim Chambers, one of the world's most connected guys in terms of ticketing on to our board as a non-executive director,\" explains Pearce. \"Then we just focused on really growing the traffic to our website, going from zero to 100,000 monthly active users. It was this growth and our progress to date that enabled us to attract a much larger PS750,000 investment,\" adds Pearce.  Both Coley and Pearce appeared on Dragon's Den at the start of 2017, when TickX was hailed \"the Uber of events\" by multi-millionaire Peter Jones. The startup received three offers of investment: a joint offer of PS75,000 from Peter Jones and Nick Jenkins for 20 percent equity, and one from Touker Suleyman for 15 percent equity. But to the surprise of the Dragons, the pair rejected all offers. \"We actually filmed Dragon's Den in May [2016] and when we said no to the Dragons we were looking for investment that that point. And then we managed to finalise that round of investment in November [2016],\" says Pearce. \"We were pleased with the results. It was just a huge stamp of validation that they were interested in TickX. We just felt that the offers undervalued the business, where we are up to and our progress to date. So we thought we'd roll the dice,\" says Pearce. \"We are confident we have made the right decision\", he adds. Since its filming, TickX has secured PS750,000 in funding from investment firm 24Haymarket, former Chairman of BskyB Nick Ferguson and Stan Boland and other top-level investors, adding to its PS175,000 backing from music giants Ministry of Sound secured last year. This funding adds up to 10 times more than the PS75,000 offered by the Dragons. \"Upon closing that round we are now a team of seven and we will be going to 12 in the next three to four months,\" says Pearce. \"We are in a period of rapid growth now which is nice to have because when we first finalised the round we were just dipping our feet in the water and getting used to growing the users and getting used to the tech. But now we're seeing rapid growth every month,\" he adds.  For any startup in any sector, the first couple of years are definitely the hardest. Getting to grips with aspects of business law, staffing issues and technical matters are among the top issues startups will face in the early stages. \"One of the challenges we've faced is the shortage of developers in the UK and finding talent, particularly on the tech side,\" explains Pearce. \"Another challenge is that we are working round the clock, you never stop thinking about it. So finding some sort of work-life balance is important. There really isn't any separation which is both a positive and a negative. \"Finally raising capital is very tough. We've brought some incredible investors onboard but it's not been a smooth journey. My advice for anyone that's trying to raise funding is to try and get the growth there first and try and get excitement to the platform to get a lot of people interested in what you're doing because people like backing companies that other people want to back,\" says Pearce. Last year seemed to be the year of the chatbot, or at least the year companies started making chatbots part of their business strategy. And TickX is no different. \"We're going to be launching a ticketing bot. You'll be able to send a message to Facebook Messenger and it will show you all the events around you,\" says Pearce. \"It's the new hot topic. You can get from A to B a lot quicker. And we want to have it so you can say, 'find me four of the cheapest upper circle tickets to see the Lion King' and it can say 'how about these?' and send you the correct ones. \"I think it's going to be the first of its kind globally really as we've got his special source of inventory that no one else has so it should be quite an exciting project,\" highlighted Pearce.

      "content": "Parkopedia started out a decade ago with the aim of mapping the complex parking landscape in major cities, giving users of a single view of all the nearby car parking options. CEO Eugene Tsyrklevich explained to Techworld how far the business has come over the past few years in terms of data science and why it is betting big on helping car manufacturers with the challenge of autonomous parking.  \"When the company started big data didn't exist, the iPhone had just launched, deep learning as a term didn't exist, so we couldn't have predicted any of this stuff. What we did know was parking was and still is a problem. \"Fundamentally we still allow people to find and pay for parking around the globe, but how we do it and go about that is changing and continues to change.\" You may have already used Parkopedia without realising. It provides parking information onboard newer vehicles from the likes of Volvo and Volkswagen (VW), as well as within Apple's own iOS maps app. The startup has amassed a trove of parking data since being established in 2007, from fairly static data on various car parks (address, capacity, height restrictions, opening hours, price, etc.) to an increasingly dynamic data set provided via APIs from partners, which includes availability at any car park that has sensors fitted to its barriers, plus GPS and traffic flow information from the car manufacturers themselves. Parkopedia started out with people on the ground surveying and taking pictures of car parks and storing the data on racks of on-premise servers. Now it has been shifted to Amazon Web Services. It now holds petabytes of parking information in the cloud, including millions of images, alongside the dynamic data feeds from its partners. Here the startup can leverage some of the elastic compute power available through AWS to do more advanced processing of this data, increasing the reliability of the service for users. This is where the data science comes in. The Parkopedia team of four PhDs has developed predictive algorithms to give drivers an indication of availability at a car park ahead of arrival. Tsyrklevich says that at a car park with sensors installed, and which is feeding this data to the Parkopedia app, is able to predict availability to 95 percent accuracy.  However, Tsyrklevich notes \"the parking industry is not a very sophisticated industry\" and most of the time this sort of technological infrastructure isn't in place. He explained: \"The reality though is that most car parks don't have that because it is expensive. Particularly for street [parking] there isn't a huge appetite from local authorities for this, so we have to fall back on other data sources.\" As part of partnership arrangements with car manufacturers Parkopedia receives information from connected navigation systems. \"That data is already used to create traffic maps. We are using the same data from the same systems but instead of working out how quickly they are moving we work out how they are moving, so are they circling an area to find a space? We use that to figure out if there is a space available or not,\" he said. \"That is just one example of how we leverage machine learning in a relatively dumb domain of parking.\" Tsyrklevich's focus now is on autonomous parking. \"While everyone is concentrating on the exciting and hard part of navigating a motorway or a city, very few companies today are talking about what happens when a vehicle gets to the destination and what happens then,\" he said. \"That for me is where we step in and grab this last mile, or 500 metres, of routing after you are dropped off.\" In short, Tsyrklevich wants Parkopedia to be the data source autonomous vehicles use to understand where to park when there is no GPS coverage - such as in an underground or multi-storey car park - and then to help it navigate to the space. This is what the company proved with Volkswagen and presented at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this month. Commenting on the project, Parkopedia's COO Dr. Hans Puvogel said: \"The self-parking car of the future will need excellent data to find the right parking spot, transaction capabilities to book and/or pay for it and indoor navigation capabilities.\"  Using a 3D laser scanner Parkopedia creates a 3D map of inside a parking garage to the centimetre, including every wall, ramp and pillar. The car then uses its own sensors to navigate the space, as it would with GPS coverage, to navigate to, and eventually into, the parking space. If a car park has sensors over every space this could then be used to indicate which spaces are free for an autonomous vehicle. Parkopedia is still a small company though, and Tsyrklevich realises that this sort of project has its risks. He believes that autonomous driving - and parking - is a question of when not if, but \"there is such a thing as being too early\". \"At this point we need to answer a few questions, some are technical regarding if it's possible for a vehicle to navigate fully autonomously without GPS coverage, and we have proven that out with VW. \"The next question is when will the vehicle of the future actually require this? As you can imagine, going out and laser scanning car parks is not a cheap endeavour so it is expensive and time consuming and while we have people on the ground globally, we would rather not do work at that scale and expense unnecessarily.\"  This means that although this is a big project for Tsyrklevich he is proceeding with caution: \"We are continuing to work on the autonomous valet parking but we need to work out when the car industry is ready.\" \"That is a huge project, we have proven some of the concept but it is a massive area trying to figure out how to do this better and at scale, not just at one car park but across 75 countries.\" ",

      "content": "Last week at the consumer electronics show (CES) in Las Vegas the event's organiser said the UK government's lack of support for startups was a \"source of embarrassment\". Gary Shapiro's comments were no doubt self-serving - he was criticising the government specifically for not supporting startups to attend CES - but did he have a point? UK minister for sport, media and culture Matt Hancock responded to the criticism, telling the BBC: \"He's wrong on that because the British presence here is significant. This is one of many different shows around the world where we have a British presence. In a sense what it shows is there is a constant battle to stay ahead.\" So what does the UK government do to support technology startups? Here are the main resources available to founders, from hard funding to soft advice. There are many ways to fund a startup. You can bootstrap the business yourself or through friends and family, go to the bank or gain entry to an incubator or accelerator. In terms of government support though there are several funding routes that can be taken.  The government's Start Up loans scheme offers up to PS25,000 at a fixed interest rate of 6 percent per annum for new business ideas, as well as mentoring and support services. Theresa May pledged PS2 billion in government investment by 2020 for projects and businesses conducting research and development of cutting edge technology, with a specific focus on AI, robotics and biotechnology. Government body Innovate UK (formerly the Technology Strategy Board) holds funding competitions for businesses and research organisations. Funding of between PS250,000 and PS10 million is up for grabs from its 2016/17 budget of PS561 million for anyone working on emerging technologies; health and life sciences; infrastructure systems; and manufacturing and materials. For businesses setting up shop in the capital there is the London Co-Investment Fund, founded and managed by Funding London and Capital Enterprise and which includes PS25 million in funds from the Mayor of London's Growing Places fund. This money is earmarked for investment in seed rounds of between PS250,000 to PS1 million for successful applicants. In terms of soft support the Business is Great website is a solid resource for information on subjects as varied as how to protect your intellectual property to tax advice. Tech.london is also a resource for founders to find tips on setting up in the capital, from workspaces and events to mentorship programmes, job boards and funding tips. Tech London is a joint project between the Mayor of London, investor portal Gust and lead sponsor IBM. London & Partners also offers support and advice for scale-up companies looking to set up shop in the capital. Former Mayor of London Boris Johnson also set up the International Business Programme last year to help UK startups to set up and trade abroad.  The government is also keen to present the UK as a good place for startups to set up outside of their home market due to its corporation tax rates, access to talent, the ability to register a business within 48 hours and general government support and guidance. For example: it may have outgrown the startup moniker by now but Snapchat parent company Snap Inc recently decided to set up its international headquarters in the UK, regardless of the Brexit vote. The government relaxed rules on visas for up to 200 \"exceptional\" technology workers a year through the Tech Nation visa scheme in October 2015. However many in the sector warn that access to international talent is too restricted. Since the beginning of April 2016 the Home Office has issued just over half of the available visas, according to Tech City UK. However, it still takes on average 16 weeks to hire someone through the government's tier 2 visa for skilled workers with a job offer and around three weeks without that. The government also offers entrepreneur visas for founders with \"businesses which have high growth potential\" and has been funded by at least PS50,000 from an approved organisation. However, the future of these schemes, and of visas for tech talent wanting to live and work in the UK in general, is currently up in the air following the UK decision to leave the EU. Nine technology entrepreneurs and investors signed a letter detailing recommendations for the government post-Brexit at the end of 2016, with free movement of talent a top priority. The letter states: \"It is imperative that the government recognises the need to attract and retain the very best talent globally.\"  In terms of actual recommendations the letter states its support for a STEM passport policy. This would mean the automatic granting of a visa, or permanent residency, to foreign students who earn advanced STEM degrees like PhDs at a range of accredited UK universities, to ensure talented individuals don't leave simply because they don't get a job straight out of university. France has recently set up its own tech visa programme called the French Tech Ticket. The government's broadband connection voucher scheme provided more than 50,000 businesses with discounted broadband before being shut down at the end of 2015. The government does still run better broadband schemes for businesses in areas where their speeds are below 2MB per second. Chancellor Philip Hammond has pledged PS1 billion towards the rollout of superfast fibre optic broadband across the country in the Autumn Statement last year, however this is the latest in a long line of similar, unfulfilled, pledges by government. Tech City UK is a government-funded body which provides a range of support for technology companies. Its schemes include the Future Fifty, which gives select startups access to expertise within both the Government and across the private sector. Alumni include Just Eat, Shazam and Skyscanner. Tech City UK also runs the Digital Business Academy, a free online learning platform for budding tech entrepreneurs to learn key skills, with rewards including free and discounted work space and mentoring. The government also backed a mentoring portal, linking new businesses with relevant mentors, called mentorsme.co.uk back in 2011. ",

      "content": "Automation has been a major theme within the technology sector in recent months, as attention turns to how it will affect white-collar professionals such as lawyers. However, some are already way ahead of the curve. One such company is RAVN, a startup based in London that works primarily with the legal sector and corporate lawyers. Clients include Berwin Leighton Paisner, Sky and Bloomberg. \"The legwork of the legal industry is reading documents,\" cofounder Jan Van Hoecke tells Techworld. \"This is about automating the reading process.\" Its AI software reads, interprets and extracts information from documents, converting unstructured data into structured output more quickly and accurately than any human, the company claims. RAVN's four founders (Van Hoecke, Peter Wallqvist, Sjoerd Smeets and Simon Pecovnik) met while working for another UK tech firm, Autonomy. \"The company doesn't bear a very great name anymore because of it appearing in the press in quite a bad way,\" Van Hoecke admits, referring to HP's botched PS7 billion acquisition of Autonomy in 2011. \"It was quite innovative when it launched, its first few years and its products - the initial vision was really good,\" Van Hoecke says, although by the end \"it was not innovating, and we figured we could do it better ourselves.\" For the first year and a half the founders were based out of Peter and Simon's flat. \"I was still the earliest one in the office even though they just had to crawl out of bed,\" laughs Van Hoecke. RAVN has always been entirely self-funded, and managed to secure success by picking up some impressive initial clients like Bloomberg. \"People always say if you keep control, you will never regret it,\" Van Hoecke says. \"But you might regret taking investors on board. It's tempting because you know with money you can do a lot of things. But if so many people say this, there might be some truth to it, right?\"  Originally the founders sold consultancy services, but they soon shifted to selling products. RAVN now employs 46 people at its London HQ, plus one office in Amsterdam and another in New York. The main focus was on developing new products for processing unstructured data, which make up the vast majority of most organisations' data. RAVN worked to improve the ability of software to analyse documents with its product RAVN ACE (Applied Cognitive Engine). The company provides a 'Knowledge Graph', which links together information within organisations: by document, team, project and so on. \"We trademarked it and Google has in the meantime breached our trademark, so we should probably sue them - but on the other hand that's probably not going to happen,\" Van Hoecke laughs. RAVN also offers enterprise search products, which help to make it easier for people to find specific information within their company. \"Documents are not the final entity of information,\" he explains. \"If you are looking for something - say how to switch on the screensaver of your Mac - you don't want to go through a 20 page manual. You want to get an answer.\" \"We have a lot of competitors on the search market, but market is fragmented,\" he adds. \"Search engine companies stagnated, they were bought off by organisations like IBM and Microsoft and there was very little innovation. There still is, we're not challenged very often.\" The fact RAVN has become a company that focuses on 'AI for lawyers' was not a deliberate choice, according to Van Hoecke. \"We just got into it quite early, and we got quite good at it,\" he says. \"We got a good reputation as well.\" The reason RAVN has been so successful within the legal sector is not so much down to the type of documents involved, but the fact that the people reading them are expensive, and there is a big pressure on lawyers to become cheaper. \"They have one of the most old-fashioned ways of working in terms of the automating of their processes,\" Van Hoecke says. Another factor is the exponential growth of documents within legal firms. \"There are more contracts, they are becoming larger, so that means your legal costs will go up exponentially, which is obviously not feasible,\" he adds. Van Hoecke says he does not believe that RAVN's technology is replacing jobs. \"It's not replacing lawyers, it's enhancing them,\" he says. \"I don't pitch this as an AI lawyer doing things on their own. It's more a calculator. If you do those computations manually that takes so much time. Likewise you don't want to read 1,000 contracts. You want to get facts out of it and make your analysis - that's what you are good at, that's where your know-how comes in.\" Looking ahead to the rest of 2017, RAVN hopes to embed its reputation as an AI company and broaden its reach beyond legal into sectors like telecoms, finance and insurance. However, like many tech firms, the founders have Brexit-related fears regarding immigration. \"I think we employ 16 nationalities. That's not by design. It's by circumstance. We have Scandinavian clients, French and Spanish and for that we need native speakers in those languages. I don't know if we have to worry about our staff leaving. I hope not,\" Van Hoecke says. However, he remains upbeat about London's prospects as a tech hub. \"People sometimes ask me 'why did you start it in London?' But I think the question should be turned around,\" he says. \"It's because of London that we started. It still is one of the best places in Europe to start a tech company and didn't have that overhyped cycle that the Valley has, or the extremely high wages the Valley has. There is a lot of talent and there are a lot of clients. The only negative part is that office space is quite expensive.\" ",

      "content": "Whether you run an established small business or are just starting out, web hosting services will be needed at some stage, unless you plan on hosting your website on a (large and expensive) server yourself. Web hosting platforms will normally offer a few different packages including shared hosting and dedicated servers. For startups and small businesses, shared hosting is the most fitting option as cost remains low with decent reliability and customer service. Shared hosting means you will share a server with a variety of sites and while some argue that this can slow down site speed, for small businesses with relatively simple and clean websites, this shouldn't be a major concern. Dedicated hosting refers to renting your own physical server and should really be reserved for larger enterprises with high traffic levels. So while this will be suitable for your business one day (all being well) there really is no need to opt for an expensive dedicated server until you're ready. We take a look at some of the best shared web hosting services out there for startups, entrepreneurs and small businesses.  For around PS5 a month, GoDaddy can transfer whole existing websites to a hosting platform and offer 1-click app installation if you want your site to be linked to apps such as WordPress. For the same price GoDaddy will provide one website with 100GB storage, and for a little extra, users can upgrade to the Deluxe plan which offers the same services for unlimited websites and unlimited storage. What's more, it provides an easy to use CMS which aims to ease page uploads, and enables users to regularly access their content. GoDaddy also offers free backup, restore, and also provides an uptime guarantee of 99.9 percent (according to their website anyway). Like GoDaddy, German company 1&1 is a web hosting giant offering both Linux and Windows packages starting from PS2.99 per month (excluding VAT). 1&1 offers a variety of services including free web design software, phone and email support, a graphics archive and a pretty impressive 300Gbps network connectivity. What's more, 1&1 provided a hybrid platform, this means that your web server and webspace are on the same platform, a good choice for those wanting an inclusive and stable package. Sadly, 1&1 does not offer website domains and offers a fraction of the online storage that rivals GoDaddy provides, coming in at 10GB rather than GoDaddy's 100GB. Based in the UK, Easyspace offers (unsurprisingly) a number of UK-based data centres and both online and telephone support. So for only PS2 per month, Easyspace will provide 50GB of storage, a free domain name, 20 databases and 200 mailboxes. Although, for PS10 per month you can have unlimited, well, everything. Easyspace goes all in on the extras and incentives. Easyspace requires no setup fee and offers yearly discounts of up to 35 percent off the cost if they buy hosting for multiple years. What's more, Easyspace offers PS50 Google AdWords vouchers, free email marketing credits, email filter trials, free images from Fotolia and Word Press hosting, which is a unique range of extras.  SiteGround offers affordable web hosting plans, and from PS2.75 per month (excluding VAT), users can take advantage of reliable security, customer service, and an array of useful tutorials, making it ideal for first timers. SiteGround's shared web hosting lets users choose from their US, European and Asian-Pacific data centres. SiteGround offers both Linux and Windows hosting with a range of price plans available. Starting at PS2.75, its StartUp tier offers one website, 10GB of web storage and 10,000 monthly visits, while its GrowBig service provides multiple websites, 20GB of web storage and 25,000 monthly visits. For larger companies SiteGround offers GoGeek with provides multiple websites, 30GB of web storage and 100,000 monthly visits. Shoreditch-based UK2 provides affordable web hosting with its business package offering unlimited emails and bandwidth, free SSL certificate, a free domain and an IP address. UK2 also sells an 'essentials' package providing users with 10 websites and one free domain name but users will miss out on an IP and a SSL certificate, but for startups or micro businesses this really won't be an issue and might be the best choice financially.  Users can always upgrade to the business package when their business is big enough. Supporting both Linux and Windows, Fasthosts offers unlimited bandwidth across all its packages, 100MB mailboxes, one free domain for a year and unlimited FTP accounts.  If opting for its middle tier package, users will receive three websites, 20GB SSD space, CMS, along with all the other standard features, for PS7 per month.  What's more, Fasthosts offers UK data centres and free 24/7 phone support. And incentive-wise, Fasthosts provides PS130 of ad vouchers for all users. The majority of people might look at One as a website builder, but it actually offers a solid web hosting platform too. All One users will receive a WordPress support, unlimited email accounts, unlimited transfer and a domain. Interestingly, One offers one year free on basic packages including 15GB of storage, 512MB RAM, single database, single domain and SSL. After the year is up, it's PS1.38 per month, although you'll have to pay PS10.80 for the initial setup. ",

      "content": "London startup Essensys builds software which helps shared office landlords automate their IT and manage all their tenants in one place. The platform looks to take the IT department out of modern offices by allowing employees to self-serve things like desk booking, meeting rooms and lockers. Founder and CEO Mark Furness is an outlier when it comes to the London startup scene. The outspoken Liverpudlian doesn't fit the typical tech CEO template but if he has to fall on either the business or the technical side he is definitely more salesman than engineer.  Furness admitted to the BBC earlier this year that he knows \"not one jot\" about how to write a software programme. He made his entry into the IT industry in the early 2000s. What he saw was a problem to be solved: \"I used to look at everything to do with technology within the enterprise and it was really complicated.\" \"You'd ring up the IT team and say the time was wrong on your phone and you would get a big intake of breath and told to put a ticket in. So there had to be a better way.\"  Essensys now essentially handles the IT for 6,000 businesses in the UK, and 250 in the US, where it has been operating out of New York for almost six months. Its annual turnover is more than PS12 million and it employs more than 90 people. The startup fell into its target market of coworking spaces, as Furness explains: \"The first pitch I did was to a brand new shared workspace company who said these are my challenges, namely: responding to clients requirements when managing fifty companies with different IT needs, efficiently and cost effectively.  \"They lined up with what we were doing and we didn't look back, that first customer meant that we would become the IT provider to that flexible workspace industry. That immediately became the play for us.\" The Essenys platform started out as a way for businesses to automate their IT but has evolved to become a de-facto customer relationship management (CRM) tool for shared workspace landlords following the acquisition of UK startup and workspace management specialists Hubcreate.  The platform that came out of the acquisition is called Occupie \"which is a single platform for the industry to manage all kinds of workspace. The whole customer journey,\" Furness says. The four parts are prospect (which is essentially a CRM tool for landlords to manage tenant acquisition), operate (enterprise resource planning), connect (flexible IT infrastructure like wifi, network and phone line provisioning) and community (a self-serve platform for tenants to book meeting rooms, reserve desks and ancillary services like postage). Landlords can manage their tenants in one place, from customer acquisition to automated billing, and employees can work in an environment where their technology needs are met and resources like desk and meeting rooms can be booked straight from their phone, without an IT ticket in sight. Occupie is run in the cloud, in a private instance across four data centres, two in the UK and two in the United States. It is priced on a typical software-as-a-service (SaaS) model of pay what you use. The shared workspace market is booming, with flexible working on the rise and tech companies looking to embrace the WeWork model of design and technology led work space to attract young talent. The US company WeWork, which rents and subleases office space with a specific look and feel, has ridden this wave all the way to a $16 billion valuation and 500,000 members.  Essensys targets smaller players trying to emulate WeWork's model. Furness said: \"Regis and WeWork are 17 percent of the global market opportunity. My job is to empower that 83 percent to beat them at their own game.\" What this means is it's now better placed than any software company to benefit from the boom in coworking space, working with smaller tech incubators like Level 39 in Canary Wharf and The Dock in Wapping. Property agents and brokers, science parks and serviced offices make up the rest of the Essensys customer base. Furness sees his advantage over the big players as a case of focus. \"I've got 70 product people and I think WeWork's developer team is 20 people. It's really difficult for a WeWork to keep up with someone like us that only thinks about this singular focus.\" Although Furness would never use the Silicon Valley term, he certainly sees Essensys as well placed to hit unicorn status. \"I have no doubts, this is a billion dollar company and I hope I am here when it is and I want to do it based on real metrics like revenue and earnings,\" he said.  Furness also refused to rule out the possibility of taking its first round of venture capital or even going public. \"If you asked me a few years ago I would say I am the last person to take my company public,\" he said. \"Now I think that is a definite option. I think we are the right size and the growth curve is right, the tech is proprietary so we have the IP. We have all the attributes for growth capital or a listing.\" Furness clearly feels that he has put the company in a position to succeed, saying his job now is to \"set the tempo of the business and make sure we don't fuck it up\".

      "content": "Open innovation has become a popular term these days, especially within large companies which have the feeling that they have no choice but to find new ways of nurturing innovation in order to keep up the pace of today's business world. They are increasingly keen to engage with startups - either by launching their own scheme or by taking part in a local or sectoral open innovation programme - convinced that dealing with \"disruptive\" businesses will help them accelerate change and innovation internally.  Yet 80 to 90 percent of open innovation centres fail. These figures, cited in a recent report by Capgemini Consulting and Altimeter, summarise a paradoxical difficulty faced by most companies: they want open innovation, but it doesn't produce the sought-after effects. So how can these big companies best go about accessing it?  The main reason why open innovation strategies fail is tied to an important fact: they are shackled by the \"magical thinking\" of startups. Essentially, large companies believe that they are insufficiently innovative because they do not have enough contact with creative types: Steve Jobs' cherished misfits, the people that practice the \"first principles thinking\" promoted by Elon Musk, without facing the limitations and obstacles of large organisations. The objective of open innovation policies therefore often involves identifying one or more startups and integrating them into a large group process in order to bring their energy, ideas and new methods. However, these attempts mostly fail because large groups are ill-adapted to listen to partner or integrated startups. What is more, the daily reality of venture capitalists is also discouraging: 98 percent of startups do not become highly successful - that is, they do not manage to identify and develop a sufficiently large-scale economic model to be able to capture or transform a market, and are thus condemned to survival, bankruptcy or resale in financial conditions which are greatly inferior to those initially expected. And when these young companies manage to convince one or more investors to participate in development, this figure improves yet remains far from guaranteeing success: less than 20 percent of backed companies were considered to be remarkable investments, having been the source of radical transformation of a market. While many startups raise several hundred thousand pounds, big corporates devote billions of pounds to Research and Development and have access to resources which are often unique, in addition to experienced people and organised and large-scale capacities for innovation, yet have failed to find the formula for achieving major, radical innovation. They thus see startups as \"dragon slayers\" - a defeatist approach nearing magical thinking. Realistically, Uber has not yet eradicated traditional taxi companies and is itself being challenged by new companies, AirBnB has not replaced Accor and LendingClub has not pushed Wells Fargo out. These companies were not necessarily aiming to defeat traditional players, but rather to pre-empt or transform part of their market. This is not to say that startups are not remarkable or that there are no undeniable successes. On the contrary, these companies are incredibly rich in skills, talent and enthusiasm. But large organisations should not be looking at these young companies individually to define their open innovation strategies. Instead, groups of startups are the key to transforming markets, as they reveal trends and echo the newly emerging needs of clients. Individually, young companies are - with few exceptions - sure to experience a lack of success. But they are driven by ambition, a process and determination that come from an entrepreneurial spirit together with strategic thinking, which is very often an innovative contextualisation of market experience and the observation of emerging potential opportunities. In order to be truly innovative, a large company needs to adopt an approach which is similar to that of a venture capitalist, but within the context of the challenges facing a major group. It needs to identify emerging trends, and understand the developing ecosystem of actors and potential evolution in the value chain in order to create innovative applications with ultimately high stakes - that is to say, which have significant transformation potential in the years ahead. Essentially, it is important to not focus on the wrong objective. While it is certainly useful to work with a few innovative young companies, this reinforces the belief that large groups do not have the structural ability for innovation, while not addressing the real factors. The main objective of open innovation should therefore be to understand value chains and their potential or planned evolution, with companies examining the swarm of startups around them and identifying potential shifts in their sector and reconfigurations in process that could be threats or opportunities.

      "content": "Jess Butcher is one of the cofounders of Blippar, a visual discovery and augmented reality app launched in 2011. The company has since gone from one London office to 11 offices in locations across the US, Turkey, India, Singapore and Japan. Earlier this year the company raised $99 million US dollars from Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional and Qualcomm Ventures. Butcher now wants to use the wealth experience gained over five years of building and expanding a startup to help others follow in her footsteps, recently becoming a mentor for Tech City's programme Upscale, which promises to help 30 promising startups begin to scale up their businesses. She spoke to Techworld about what makes a good startup mentor and advice for startups hoping to expand rapidly (our questions in bold). What made you decide to be a mentor? I feel passionately about early-stage startups and the need to get more promising young British businesses to scale-up stage, competing better globally.    What make a good startup mentor in your view? Someone who listens, asks the right questions and encourages the right sense of prioritisation to quickly accelerate a startup's fortunes. They may not know all the answers or fully understand the intricacies of every business they work with but they have had enough experience to advise on typical pitfalls and give logistical advice common to all rapid growth businesses - plus can act as a softer adviser on some of the personal challenges of entrepreneurship - having 'been there and done that' and experienced many of the challenges that are common to most fast-growth businesses. What does 'scaling up' mean to you? To me, this means a business which continues to grow at a rapid rate but is moving out of the less structured 'all hands on deck', passionate 'build' stage (where they're creating something from scratch, building a market and a brand for themselves) into a more structured, hierarchical organisation where scaleable processes and rigorous focus are required. The challenges become very different - particularly around funding, culture and personnel and territorial expansion - plus more costly and damaging when it goes wrong! What are the main challenges when scaling up a startup? As above. Errors become more costly and time-consuming, burning through vital investment cash (when taken).  Finding the right people to scale your business appropriately is critical - good managers (as opposed to the very good 'do-ers' you might have focused on when starting up); plus good investors, advisors and mentors, ideally who've been there and done that.  What are the main risks to avoid? Getting your core market right before expanding territorially too quickly. Not paying enough attention to culture as you grow. Staying true to your big vision and not getting diverted by enticing short term opportunities or curve balls. Complacency and not raising your ambition and vision rapidly enough again to ensure you're always stretching yourselves and aiming five steps higher.   What practical advice can you give to startups considering the process? Start to build your network now with individuals who have successfully scaled businesses. Keep tapping into this network and rotate questions and challenges you might have around them. Sign up to all and any scale-up events you might see advertised - they can be a great source of illumination. Project your organisation chart one to two years forward, ensuring your manage team expectations as to how they might progress within your fast-growth business - dissatisfaction and politics could creep in without this transparency. Appoint good professional service advisors - from lawyers to accountants or PR firms (take recommendations from other entrepreneurs here).  Do you have any good examples of UK startups that have successfully scaled up? I think TechCity has done a pretty good job of identifying these already within their Upscale and Future50 groups!  I tend to follow the bigger tech consumer platform businesses that have scaled well internationally such as Skyscanner, Fanduel, Swiftkey etc - but there are many other great examples within the TechCity alumni pool - across a range of sectors. British technology businesses are starting to do tremendously well on the international scene and it's incumbent on them to share their knowledge and experience amongst the up and coming entrepreneurial ranks to ensure we enjoy many more international success stories!

      "content": "The vast majority of startups fail, for a multitude of reasons. However discussions around why most do not succeed seem to yo-yo between two extremes: being taboo, or being actively celebrated. \"We shouldn't celebrate it because it involves people losing jobs and money. It's painful. But by the same token, we do need to talk about it, not to be ashamed, so I hope people try and learn from me,\" says Robert Tregaskes, who cofounded startup Shnergle, which closed in 2013 after a year. He now works for heart health tech company Qardio as their head of logistics.   Tregaskes set up Shnergle with partner Jonny Bull in November 2012 while they both worked at RBS full time. They had an idea for an easy-to-use, free smartphone app that let you check out a place you wanted to visit in real-time, to help decide if you wanted to go. \"We raised a small amount of funding, hired developers and got started at the end of February 2013,\" Tregaskes explains. However after about eight months it gradually dawned on the founders that while it was a great idea, the business model was unproven, it would cost \"a fortune\" to scale, and there was very little guarantee of success. \"We basically realised: you'd be insane to invest in this. That said, never underestimate the number of people who know full well that they are peddling complete shit,\" he says. The moment of realisation was when the founders saw customer acquisition costs and conversion rates. For Shnergle to be a success, you'd need lots of people within the same area (say, Shoreditch on a Saturday evening) to have the app. \"In order to get that density you figure out how many people in London have iPhones, how many iPhones you need it on, and how much it would cost per user. We figured we'd need 1.2 million just in London to get it to the level of saturation to work,\" Tregaskes says. One of the main issues, according to Tregaskes, was that the revenue model of Shnergle was untested. Although they had promotions at venues and events to drive people to them, there was no proof of pricing or proof venues would sign people up. \"We couldn't justify putting capital in in the first place. It was an area of huge naivety on our part. We learned a lot as we got going,\" he admits. This issue became increasingly clear as the team met and exchanged emails with VCs. \"A lot of people at the time said the idea is great. Everybody understood the value...but fundamentally the business model just wasn't going to work. \"We couldn't just pivot to something adjacent because there wasn't really anything adjacent. I am all for pivoting but in a lot of instances pivoting is used as cover for going from one shit idea to another shit idea, but 'oh don't worry this new shit idea is better than the last shit idea so just give me a wee bit more cash'. It's actually cleaner, easier and you'll lose less by just shutting down and moving on\". The founders were finally forced to admit defeat in October 2013, having spent PS76,000, of which PS18,000 was put into the company by Tregaskes. They had PS2,000 left, which was distributed among investors. \"Basically we got completely wiped out. I was left with some pension from RBS and about enough money for one month's rent,\" he says. \"It's extremely painful. I went broke which wasn't fun. It's extremely traumatic. I used to be in the army and did a few tours in the Middle East. In terms of personal stress and trauma and self-esteem, this was as significant a life event,\" Tregaskes adds. A lot of people fundamentally do not understand the dynamics of how to run a successful startup and so rush in without properly thinking it through, according to Tregaskes. \"Part of the problem is that most information you read in the press about startups is very light on detail and heavy on spin, you can very easily get the wrong end of the stick,\" he says \"It's so easy to get wrapped up in the hype and glamour, not that you see much of that at the coal face. A lot of it is BS and fairydust,\" he adds. Tregaskes has a number of lessons for potential startup founders: do lots of research and speak to your users, try to work for a startup before launching your own, figure out your risk appetite and spend your money wisely. \"Talk to the people who'd be your potential customer before you do anything else,\" he says. \"The biggest learning from my perspective is it doesn't matter about protecting 'your idea'. We did the whole secrecy thing which was ruddy stupid in hindsight. If you stay secret when you launch there's no one there. So the biggest advice I learned is: get out there and talk to people.\" The next lesson is to try to get some experience within a startup before plunging headfirst into setting one up. \"If you want to create a startup go and work for one first. That way you can learn from someone else's mistakes. \"You might not get a huge salary but you can compensate that by learning, seeing stuff happen first hand. Even then it's a huge challenge to make sure you pick the right startup. Plenty work out, plenty won't - but you'll learn a lot from all of them,\" Tregaskes says. It's also vital to step back, take a deep breath and consider whether you are really in a position to take the risk of launching your own venture. For example, although \"literally no one cares\" if you start a company that fails when you are 23, as you get older you may have a mortgage or dependents, which makes it harder to cope with financial difficulty, he says. \"This is the fastest possible way to eradicate your personal wealth if you don't know what you're doing and trust me, most people don't know what they're doing,\" Tregaskes says. \"Understand your own risk appetite. Any friend who's thought about starting a company gets in touch with me. In the vast majority of cases, and I don't mean to be nasty, they are inevitably out of depth and have no idea what they're doing. Or they are too old and have too many people depending on them to be playing this game,\" he adds. Finally, Tregaskes advises startups spend money wisely, even if they have raised a lot of funding. \"In your personal life you can waste money going out to dinner or to parties and burn through cash quickly. Now imagine not just personal expenditure but running a company paying salaries, paying for services, paying for lawyers and so on. \"You can start burning through some serious cash extremely fast. It doesn't matter how rich you are, you can burn all of it if you're not careful. Even if you're minted I'd take a very cost conscious approach. Because if you don't you are either reckless or you're an arsehole,\" he says. ",

      "content": "This year delivered a whole host of body blows to the UK's thriving startup sector. There has been an investor slowdown, few notable IPOs, increased market volatility and shining lights sold abroad. Then there was the biggest punch of them all, the Brexit vote to leave the European Union and all of the issues this brings up for a sector reliant on foreign talent. So what can the UK tech startup scene expect in 2017? It will no doubt be a year of further turmoil, and startups will need to be prepared for the worst, but there are also green shoots of hope for smart founders and investors who are focusing on the right areas. Here are Techworld's predictions for startups in 2017... Like it or not machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) will be the defining technology of 2017. Even if your startup isn't specialising in developing general artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms capable of detecting fake news, elements of these technologies are finding their way into growing numbers of startup pitches as investors expect at least some level of baked in AI from any technology company worth its salt.  TechCrunch Disrupt's startup battlefield often gives a good snapshot of the startup landscape, and in London last month four of the six finalists (InsideDNA, LiftIgniter, Oxehealth and the winner Seenit) mentioned machine learning as part of their pitch. This will be the most talked about technology in 2017 and the key will be working out who is doing it right and who is peddling it as just marketing. This year saw some of the leading lights in the tech industry predict a shift in consumer habits, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella famously saying \"bots are the new apps\". The theory goes that as chatbots and AI assistants like Microsoft Cortana and Amazon Alexa mature, people will start to use bots instead of mobile apps to get stuff done. As Frank Lansink, European CEO of business automation specialists IPSoft puts it, 2017 will be the year the chatbot dies, as they evolve towards being smart assistants that can understand conversational cues rather than being preloaded with set responses to prompts. He said: \"The chatbot may have been novel in the past, but in 2017 it will become a stagnant piece of technology that will either fade into mundanity, or improve so much that it can no longer be classified as a 'bot' and will instead resemble an AI.\"  Anna Boffetta, an associate at London-based VC firm Balderton Capital, predicts that 2017 will be the year of new interfaces. She told Techworld: \"New interfaces - such a voice, audio and messaging - will become far more mainstream. Today, the vast majority of human-computer interaction is still done on screen. The new interfaces will become a part of everyday life for all users, not just early adopters. This is a result of the vast amount of data that is now being collected, structured and analysed by machines - the results of which are being delivered via conversational interfaces.\" Jeffrey Ng, chief scientist at the startup accelerator Founders Factory sees the same thing. He told Techworld: \"AI assistants are going to become cleverer with natural language advances and customer intent engines (an engine that can determine the customer's immediate circumstances and intent).\" For startups this creates an opportunity to develop more personalised apps, chatbots, Alexa skills or even fully fledged virtual assistants. This move towards machine learning and away from simple app-based user experiences means 2017 should see the best startups trend towards 'deep tech'. As Entrepreneur First's (EF) Alice Bentinck wrote for Techworld in 2015: \"This means startups that are producing defensible technology that can usually be patented. They don't use off the shelf tech solutions and the value of the company is often built on their technological developments. \"At the moment this means anything from new approaches to artificial intelligence, such as deep learning and computer vision, or new approaches to virtual reality or cyber security.\" While EF has been at the forefront of this approach for a while, 2017 could be the year that deep tech goes mainstream, particularly as investors look to focus on startups with strong intellectual property and smart founding teams. Which leads neatly on to... Brexit may pose a threat to talent fleeing to fellow EU hubs like Paris and Berlin, but it can't remove the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) talent coming out of top UK universities.  Research data by the Higher Education Funding Council for England shows that UK universities increasingly draw income from intellectual property (IP), rising by 18.5 percent year on year and pulling in PS155 million during 2014-15. The findings show that UK universities are becoming savvier than ever when it comes to licensing IP, with income from licensing deals alone rising 25 percent YoY to a total of PS103 million. This compares to the PS53 million made in shares from the sale of spinoff companies over the same time period. The key though will be keeping this talent in the country after they graduate. The second half of 2016 has seen a lot of hand wringing from the startup sector over what impact the UK's decision to leave the European Union will have.  In 2017 we will find out, and contingency plans will need to be put in place. Last month we saw that access to talent remains the biggest fear for founders. Founders and investors are keen to see the government put forward clear plans for retaining talent in the UK if there are any changes to the freedom of movement following Brexit, keep tax rates low for entrepreneurs and continue investing in the tech sector as a whole. London has positioned itself as a medtech hub for a few years now, with good government funding and hubs based around academic centres like Oxford and Cambridge. This year saw some impressive UK biotech and genomics startups take their product out of the realm of academia, and the major pharmaceutical firms are even starting to shout about their own genomic research and technological advancements.  Boffetta from Balderton Capital predicts \"that 2017 will see more funding into agri-tech and health-tech businesses\". \"As software continues to eat into health-tech and agri-tech, these sectors, that were previously outside of the scope of VCs like us, will start to look very interesting for investors. Predictive analytics and automation will optimise aspects like diagnosis and treatment in healthcare.\" The days of startups spending on extravagant offices and parties may come to an end in 2017 as we heed cautionary tales like the downfall of UK tech unicorn Powa. This could be the year we see startups focus on being lean and profitable rather than the traditional Silicon Valley model of growing fast and worrying about monetising later. Azzam Sheikh's blog post on the subject for the Huffington Post reads: \"The newer breed of businesses and business owners are focusing on staying lean and efficient; this is a shift in the right direction.\" After letting go of 10 percent of his startup's workforce earlier this year, Damien Kimmelman, founder of London based Fintech-startup DueDil told Techworld: \"It's never a nice thing to have to do but I want to build a business that can weather anything and part of that is having to really focus on things that are core to that mission and not things that are auxiliary. \"If you are too lean you can hire more\" he said. \"But if you don't pre-empt then you don't have many options in the future and it is my fiduciary responsibility to make hard decisions like this to focus on being a strong businesses.\" Similarly, Robert Tregaskes, who cofounded startup Shnergle told Techworld: \"In your personal life you can waste money going out to dinner or to parties and burn through cash quickly. Now imagine not just personal expenditure but running a company paying salaries, paying for services, paying for lawyers and so on. \"You can start burning through some serious cash extremely fast. It doesn't matter how rich you are, you can burn all of it if you're not careful. Even if you're minted I'd take a very cost conscious approach. Because if you don't you are either reckless or you're an arsehole,\" he says. Beyond fintech, RegTech is poised to be the hot area for the lucrative financial services market. As the payments and fintech bubbles have deflated somewhat the next area appears to be the unglamorous but highly important regulation technology (RegTech) sector.  In short, RegTech startups tend to focus on helping financial institutions contend with growing regulatory requirements after the 2008 financial crash, including automation of compliance tasks, mitigating operational risks and improving risk assessment through smarter use of data and more intuitive software. This requires intensive data work on the back end but opens up a lucrative market that is always looking for an edge over its competition. Virtual and augmented reality have been much hyped technologies for some time now, and even as 2016 brought good progress from big companies like the launch of commercial VR headsets from Facebook's Oculus to Microsoft's HoloLens, there has not been a huge deal of progress from VR/AR startups.  This could lead to simplistic predictions of a 2017 boom in VR/AR, but the recent revelations from The Information (summarised here) about much-hyped mixed reality startup MagicLeap shows that while it is easy to make snazzy promo-films, making the technology affordable, compact and powerful is no mean feat.

      "content": "The world of finance and banking can often seem confusing and inaccessible, even to the most clued-up customer. Add to that a vast, bewildering array of new fintech companies and challenger banks and it's virtually impossible to know whether you're getting a good deal or not. However, one recently-launched startup called Bud promises to cut through the noise.  Its app provides one place where you can manage all your finances (be it a current account, credit card or savings account), which it calls its 'universal banking platform'.  Bud also plans to launch a 'marketplace' where you can compare different available products before choosing one, a feature it expects to launch in the coming weeks, cofounder and CEO Edward Maslaveckas tells Techworld. This will include 'intelligent assistant' technology which will tailor recommendations based on your answers to questions. \"The closest current competitor would probably be Moneysupermarket. But this will have a couple of hundred fintech companies when it's built. It's huge. Also the system will understand your banking and finance data, helping to take out guesswork and point you in exactly the right direction,\" he says. Bud launched in September 2015 and released its app in July 2016. The company has been self-funded to this point but plans to raise its first round of capital in February 2017. The eight-strong team, led by two cofounders, has recently been joined by fintech veteran David Brear as non-executive director and is set to expand further next year.  It's still early days for Bud, with 2,000 users testing its app in beta. \"We've not really pushed it massively yet. At the moment it's mainly just making the platform work for people. We've had lots of great, useful feedback,\" Maslaveckas says. Bud is part of the Financial Conduct Authority's regulatory sandbox (which lets companies test innovative new financial products in a live environment), the innovative aspect here being algorithmic matching to match people and financial products. \"You don't get that level of personalisation with a comparison site or a human. It's very difficult to understand all the products out there. That's a task technology is better at, and it means you can be served in a more intelligent, personalised way,\" Maslaveckas explains. The app itself is currently available online on desktop and on iOS devices. It has a simple, intuitive interface and the process of integrating bank accounts is painless.  It uses two-factor authentication and can currently connect with American Express, Barclays, First Direct, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Natwest or RBS accounts (with more to join over the next two years). There will also be fintech companies like Nutmeg, Azimo, PensionBee and bigger players like Western Union available eventually. The section of the app that is available at the moment - the 'universal banking platform' - is still quite basic. Testing an account on it, the 'insights' section categorises spending overwhelmingly as 'general' (then 'food and drink', 'transport', and 'personal finance'), which doesn't actually provide much of what you could dub insight. However, as Bud have been keen to emphasise, it's still early on in the app's development and only a small proportion of the eventual functionality is available. Beyond the new 'marketplace' feature, Bud plans to deploy new functionality such as ways to allocate whether spending is a business or personal expense, plus functions for joint accounts. \"We will add in lots of little tools. Each of those are an opportunity to optimise your financial world a little bit. We will be agnostic to platforms and providers, figuring out what people want and don't want. It's very individual which is what we want,\" Maslaveckas says. However he does admit \"the challenges from a tech perspective are quite high. Optimising individuals and building assistants is tough\". Maslaveckas tells an anecdote about finding a letter from his mum's bank manager sent to her to congratulate her when she got married. \"We have lost that personal touch with banking. We're trying to get that back. It's an app that works with all the providers, but it's also mine, my tool which advises me,\" he says. ",

      "content": "Digital challenger banks, a new breed of banks that aim to give customers a simple, transparent experience mainly through a mobile app, are starting to grow to maturity.  As a growing number acquire their banking licenses under new, more relaxed regulations since 2013 these \"neo\" banks have been quietly launching products, from saver accounts to mortgages, as they seek to draw disgruntled customers away from the traditional banks. Atom Bank, based in the north east of England, far away from the fintech hub of London, has the jump on many of its rivals, launching its app in April 2015 and announcing that it will be offering a mortgage product earlier this month. In a candid interview, Atom Bank CEO Mark Mullen ran Techworld through its product pipeline, explaining why it is getting into mortgages before current accounts as it plans to shake up the banking sector in 2017. Atom Bank started providing two year fixed rate residential mortgages through selected independent advisers in December 2016, joining its two Fixed Saver accounts and SME business lending product. Customers can track any changes to their mortgage progress after receiving a decision in principle (DIP) through the Atom app. The current process doesn't exactly sound game changing though. Atom says: \"Customers can find an intermediary who is able to discuss Atom mortgages via our customer support team.\" Atom works with 800 established mortgage providers, and will underwrite mortgages on its own balance sheet, making all providers searchable in a single, transparent way once this process becomes available on the app. However, the bank won't currently share a timeline for when the entire end-to-end mortgage process will be available through their mobile app.  Mullen believes that there are ways new banks like Atom, and smaller players like startup mortgage brokers Trussle and Habito, can remove some of the more tedious elements of the mortgage process with technology like robo advice and chatbots. However, fundamentally there is \"no machine-only answer, that's not how you buy mortgages,\" he said. \"Here's the thing, the mortgage market is highly regulated for affordability and suitability and 80 percent of the current deals flow through traditional brokers and intermediaries. That is driven by the regulatory environment. It is an advised sales journey, so you have to have an accredited advisor to ensure you can afford the repayments and that it is stressed for if interest rates change.\"  Atom will continue to tweak and develop its mortgage product, as it does with all products, but Mullen says he is \"pretty happy that the process we have built today gives us a strong foundation\". He wants to further digitise Atom mortgages and bring artificial intelligence into the process for greater personalisation. In the end everything will be \"driven by regulator comfort levels, the interest of the customer and what the customer's emotional journey is, so where they need help and reassurance.\" Tom Blomfield, CEO at fellow neo bank Monzo told Techworld that the mortgage process doesn't have to be \"entirely computer driven\" but that banks should be using technology to make the process better for the customer. He said: \"It doesn't matter if you type to a person or pick up the phone, what people don't want is to fill in 15 pages of forms and wait two months for a decision.\"  Daniel Hegarty, CEO of startup mortgage broker Habito, a world where his startup can partner with forward thinking banks like Atom, saying: \"It's very exciting to see a new lender coming to market with a digital offering, and seeking to partner with intermediaries who can ensure that customers receive the best advice possible. We look forward to working with Atom Bank in the near future and continuing the broader mortgage revolution.\" When asked why it launched mortgages before current accounts, Mullen had a simple answer: it was Atom Bank's strategy all along. \"Right from the get go we wanted to start gathering deposits and lend that money to small businesses, which we started a few months ago, then lend to the residential mortgage market. When we completed those products we would expand our range to current accounts and to include the broader range of retail banking products and present them on an open platform,\" he said. Mullen sees current accounts as an important product, but not one that brings much in for the bank as customers refuse to pay for a current account outright. This means banks are forced to make money from ancillary services like foreign exchange and overdraft fees. \"We still believe we should have [a current account] but with a business model that is acting in the best interest of transparency and fairness,\" he said.  On a point of principle, these new banks are trying to distance themselves from overdrafts. Mullen explained: \"The dirty secret of overdrafts is the people that pay the fees are people that can't afford not to.\" He says that aside from PPI, overdrafts are the most complained about banking product. He asks rhetorically: \"Are banks being proportionate with their overdraft?\" Monzo has its own take on overdrafts, which it hopes to launch in 2017 once its banking licence restrictions are lifted and it can offer customers a current account. The Monzo approach is to inform customers when they are at risk of becoming overdrawn and offer to lend the required money at a fixed rate. This rate will still be in the \"double digit\" interest range, Blomfield says, but there will be \"no crazy fees. Most banks charge in the triple digits once you add it all together,\" he said. When it comes to his own point of principle, Mullen says Atom won't be manufacturing a credit card. \"I don't like the dynamics of a credit card business because revenues associated are generated disproportionately and invisibly,\" he said. \"You have those that can't pay it off and those that can, but you have interchange fees, overseas charges and ATM access charges are disproportionate.\" He continued that while Atom is \"not here to tell a customer they shouldn't have a credit card\" it will help customers to find the best deal and then manage it in a single place: the Atom app. Atom will be launching a full suite of banking products throughout 2017, including current accounts, debit cards, overdrafts and instant access savings, all of which will be managed via the app. Atom Bank has raised PS135 million in capital from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and fund manager Neil Woodford so far, and is reportedly looking to raise another PS100 million. In terms of future funding Mullen said: \"We have a fantastic investor base and are working to look at the next capital raise on our balance sheet for 2017.\" He says this money will be primarily used to grow its balance sheet rather than for operations and product development. He added that investors \"don't have indefinite patience, so we need financial viability, as opposed to being a nice tech business\". ",

      "content": "Nine UK venture capitalists and entrepreneurs have penned a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May with their recommendations to maintain the UK's strong position in the global tech industry, including persistent concerns over access to talent post-Brexit. As TechCrunch Disrupt draws to a close in London this week, and following research from VCs Atomico and Balderton Capital, the letter outlines 10 key areas they want to see addressed during Brexit negotiations. The letter reads: \"Despite these uncertain times, the British high-growth technology sector needs certainty from the UK government when it comes to a number of issues in order to continue its world-class status.\" Signatories of the letter include VCs from Balderton Capital and Accel Partners, as well as founders from Betfair and Lastminute.com. The leading issue for the sector post-Brexit continues to be access to talent. A recent report by London-based VC firm Balderton Capital showed that 82 percent of founders saw access to talent as the biggest concern post-Brexit. Ability to raise finance came in second at 44 percent. The letter states: \"It is imperative that the government recognises the need to attract and retain the very best talent globally.\"  Niklas Zennstrom, the billionaire founder of Skype and CEO at venture fund Atomico, isn't worried about the UK's ability to remain a \"deep tech centre\", saying during TechCrunch Disrupt that this talent will maintain London's position as a tech powerhouse in Europe post-Brexit. Zennestrom also stressed the need for the UK government to loosen its immigration policies for high skilled workers: \"Whatever happens [the government] need to make sure that companies, tech companies, have access to the best talent in the world,\" he said. In terms of actual recommendations the letter states its support for Hillary Clinton's proposed STEM passport policy to be revived here in the UK. This would mean the automatic granting of a visa, or permanent residency, to foreign students who earn advanced STEM degrees like PhDs at a range of accredited UK universities, to ensure talented individuals don't leave simply because they don't get a job straight out of university. France has recently set up its own tech visa programme called the French Tech Ticket, as it looks to benefit from the UK's exit from the European Union.  James Wise, a partner at Balderton Capital said during TechCrunch Disrupt yesterday: \"For an industry with the cliched motto of move fast and break things, we are going to have to radically change the way that we process visas. \"It takes on average 16 weeks to hire someone through the tier 2 visa process and around three weeks without that, so a three month difference.\" The letter makes a range of general recommendations around access to talent, including that \"visas of skilled tech workers from strong tech nations (USA, India, Commonwealth, Eastern Europe) need to be preserved post-Brexit\". It also suggests ensuring that \"British universities remain an attractive place to study for non-British and British citizens alike\", and wants the UK government to \"take a zero tolerance policy approach to hate crime, sending a signal to our diverse workforce that all are welcome\". This follows a recent proposal from Home Secretary Amber Rudd to force companies to disclose how many foreign workers they employ. Digital and culture minister Matt Hancock MP, for his part, either didn't have a clear plan for visas, or didn't want to reveal it, stating only that \"we've got to get this right over the next two and a bit years\" if the UK is to win \"that global war for talent\". Hancock added that the government has essentially ruled out the Australian points-based immigration system, but reassured that \"of course there will be a plan put in place\". Among the rest of the recommendations is a tax rebate for small startups \"if their business rates make up more than, for example, 5 percent of their overhead expenses\". The letter also recommends better investment in research and development, asking that government \"reform the R&D tax credits to help the share of both private and public R&D expenditure to increase\". It also requests that \"the government should campaign for access not just to the Single Market, but also the EU's Digital Single Market\". Another recommendation is for a concerted PR effort for the tech sector, asking for \"a campaign that 'Tech Britain Is Open' to complement the Mayor of London's current efforts with 'London Is Open'\". The UK is currently the clear European leader when it comes to startup employees, but that could easily change if Brexit has a detrimental effect. Speaking about Balderton's research into \"the Brexit challenge\", partner James Wise said: \"The UK is still the number one nation that people look to for work in tech roles outside of their home country across Europe and that has not really changed a lot since the Brexit vote.\" However, just a 20 percent swing would put the UK back on terms with the other major European hubs of Paris and Berlin, according to the research.  On the same panel, French innovation minister Axelle Lemaire said that the UK should be worried about losing its leading position when it comes to research. She said: \"Researchers are extremely worried at the moment because when you enter into a research contract it's for a minimum of five years. If you work on artificial intelligence at the moment you do need European grants and funding.\" Paris and France more generally are certainly in a good position at the moment in Europe, but also on the international stage, to attract the most innovative people [...] So, yes, France wants to be one of the most attractive countries in the world for this asset.\"  Hancock was keen to deflect from this subject though, saying that even with a cumbersome visa system the UK has been able to attract talent from all over the world, not just Europe. He said: \"We have been able to be that global magnet for talent... we want to continue to attract the best and brightest. So you can't just see this through a European lens.\" Hancock was also bullish on London's ability to attract talent on its own merits: \"People come to places that they want to live and the UK culture scene and London in particular as one of the best cities in the world to live your life is an important part of attracting talent.\" How this will work if tech talent can't get a visa to live and work in London wasn't raised.

      "content": "Even tech giants like Google admit they can't find a solution to the hiring problem. Laszlo Bock, Google's senior vice president for people operations, told LinkedIn in 2013: \"We looked at tens of thousands of interviews, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they scored the candidate, and how that person ultimately performed in their job. We found zero relationship. It's a complete random mess.\" So if Google can't work it out, what chance do the rest of us have? Well technology has come a long way since 2013, and there are a handful of startups that are claiming to have a genuinely tried-and-tested approach when it comes to smarter hiring techniques. Browse the latest tech jobs with Techworld.  Here are the recruitment startups that everyone - from startups themselves, to big enterprise customers - are looking to help them find not just the best talent to hire, but also the best fit for your company culture. Pluralsight is a learning and development startup from Utah which focuses on bite-size training courses for IT professionals. The cloud-based platform has more than 5,000 video courses across a range of technical skills and proficiencies, from Angular to XML. Technical courses are broken up across seven specialities: software development, IT ops, data, creative industries, business, manufacturing and design, architecture and construction. Popular courses include Java and Python fundamentals, C# and advanced Javascript.  Each technical tutorial is authored by an expert in the field who is paid commission depending on how often the video is viewed. Pluralsight has more than 800 authors, some of whom earn millions of dollars in commission every year, with the average being between forty and fifty thousand dollars a year. Pluralsight is the only unicorn on this list after completing a massive $135 million (PS94m) Series B funding round in August 2014, putting the company very close to a $1 billion valuation. Hired is flipping the traditional recruiter-candidate relationship on its head by giving desirable candidates a platform to sell themselves and wait for employers to apply to them. Hired says that it: \"Selects the top five to seven per cent of candidates through a combination of human curation and machine learning algorithms before matching them with relevant interview opportunities. The Silicon Valley-startup will pair you with a \"talent advocate\" to help polish your profile and negotiate with potential employers. Hired is free for candidates and is looking to appeal to employers by offering access to high quality, high intent candidates, generally in the tech and sales sectors. Hired then charges 15 percent of the hire's first year base salary or 2 percent of the hire's annual salary per month for their first ten months of employment. The platform is currently available on an invite only basis (you can request one) for tech, sales and marketing roles in London and key US cities. Hired claims to have 2,000 plus companies already using the platform. Hired has raised more than $100 million (PS80m) in funding to date, including a $30 million extension to its Series C round in November 2016 led by Glenmede Trust and Ontario Pension Board. Silicon Valley startup Gild has been steadily building a database of tens of millions of professionals which incorporates data from across the internet. This includes social media output and GitHub code contributions, so the platform can build up as full a picture of candidates as possible. Gild even has its own CRM (Candidate Relationship Management) platform for recruiters to pool and keep track of candidates, and automate time-consuming admin skills. Gild utilises this data driven approach and identifies ideal candidates for openings and applies expertise and demand ratings, as well as predictive analytics, to speed up the recruitment process. Gild already counts BuzzFeed, Facebook, HBO and Microsoft as customers and completed its Series B funding round back in June 2014 to the tune of $13.5 million (PS9.5 million), led by Menlo Ventures. Krishan Meetoo, along with his co-founder Carl Dawson, set up Proversity to provide a learning and development environment \"across the employee lifecycle, from attracting talent through to on boarding them by providing the professional and soft skills they need for the role. So try before you buy with candidates,\" Meetoo said. London-based Proversity is working in the corporate learning space, providing an on-demand mobile platform that brings employee attraction, recruitment and retention into one place. Candidates are given a structured learning programme, with each course being designed on a bespoke basis depending on the employer needs. Content can range from text, photos, motion graphics, video walkthroughs and various forms of assessment, from essays to simple check boxes. Proversity raised $1.6 million (PS1 million) in investment from Czech Republic fund RSBC Venture Capital in November 2015 and is planning a PS5-8 million Series A round this year as it expands into the USA, Middle East and ASEAN markets. It has already worked with Network Rail and the Bank of England to attract and train new employees. Co-founders Alex Hanson-Smith and Matt de la Hey were both working in hospitality during the summer away from University when the idea for Inploi started to germinate. Hanson-Smith told Techworld: \"Finding work was way too hard. We were walking around with hard copies of CVs, looking for signs in windows. Or you would have to go to an agency and wait three weeks for a training day. The frustration of that process - in the age of Uber and Deliveroo - made it dawn on us that this was an inefficient marketplace.\" Instead of posting to job boards or using agencies, Inploi allows employers to engage with interested workers direct on their platform. By integrating messaging (built on Firebase) and payments platforms (built on Stripe Connect) within the app itself, small to medium sized employers can simplify their hiring processes for short and part time workers. Posting a job is free and Inploi adds a ten percent service charge to employers for any wages paid on their platform for short term work. For longer term work, the company charges depending on the number of employees a company connects with, which is free up to five and then on a sliding scale starting at PS100 a month for nine connections. Inploi came out of Beta in December 2016 and is available on web, iOS and Android. It already counts 280 employers signed up, including Michelin-starred Alyn Williams at the Westbury, the Corbin and King group and Edwardian Hotels. Inploi has been funded from angel investors, friends and family so far, with the startup looking for a \"substantial\" funding round to expand beyond London this year. Saberr works by surveying potential hires and existing staff and applies an algorithm to define a 'resonance score' which the startup claims can predict how well a team will work together. Saberr's survey concentrates on deep values rather than shared interests to define if a candidate is a good fit for your company culture. Managers will then receive a breakdown of compatibility scores ranging from 0-100 (100 being the most compatible) for each co-worker so that better teams can be formed. This approach is naturally appealing to startups that have inherently small teams but enterprise customers like Capco and Coca Cola have been testing the Saberr platform to predict team performance. In terms of funding, founder Alistair Shepherd told Techworld.com: \"For us it doesn't make sense to take VC capital,\" he says. \"There's lots of interest but we are making the conscious decision not to take it.\" However, in April 2016 the startup took a PS1 million funding round led by Angel CoFund. This early-stage startup was one of the 25 companies to pitch at Entrepreneur First's massive Demo Day in March 2016. Quantize is looking to apply machine learning to online CVs to identify applicants' hard and soft skills and match them to existing top-performers within the organisation, in the hope of predicting future success. How it works in practice is Quantize will come in and set your organisation up with an account manager before plugging your applicant tracking system (ATS) and existing performance data into an API which, using Quantize's algorithm, scores and prioritises potential candidates according to measures like selection likelihood, turnover likelihood and performance forecasts via a dashboard. Having just pitched at the EF demo day Quantize is still in the seed-funding stage, but looks to have a fully functioning product which is just waiting for investment and customers. Co-founder and ex-Harvard and LinkedIn alum Khary Francis claims to already be piloting with a multi-national recruitment agency which counts Tesco as a client. Debut is a native mobile app aimed at connecting students with graduate scheme, internship and job opportunities in their field. Conversely employers are able to search through and cherry pick from a list of potential candidates. Debut also pulls in employer-sponsored games that can lead to internships, as well as a wealth of documentation and employment hints and tips. Simply download the app and build a profile (personal details, important causes, exam results, degree) and start browsing jobs by sector, salary, role and location. Employers can then contact candidates through the 'talent spots' messenger tab. Employers listed on the Debut banner already include Barclays, BT, Credit Suisse, Microsoft and Google. Founded by two software engineers in 2008, Vivek Ravisankar and Hari Karunanidhi wanted to be spending more time on code and less time interviewing engineers. Plus they noticed that the traditional CV-to-interview recruitment model just didn't work for finding great programmers.  The result was a set of CodeChallenges, which eventually became the backbone for HackerRank, an online portal for delivering online tests which help find the best coders by placing them in real-world situations. This allows companies to hire developers on technical skill and merit rather than how well they promote themselves. HackerRank also doubles up as a portal for skills challenges so that developers can hone their skills whenever they want. HackerRank has raised just short of $20 million in funding so far, and lists tech giants Facebook and Airbnb as customers. Talent Rank is an online learning and development (L&D) environment. The platform wants to make candidate assessment smarter and more engaging by building bite-size online challenges that identify core competencies beyond CVs and interviews. Founder Arjun Hassard told Techworld.com that Talent Rank is very much inspired by US-based Hacker Rank, except: \"They are coder first and we are analyst, or candidate, first.\" \"There's a paradigm shift here from passively trying to absorb insight on the candidate to conscious volunteering of information through engaging programmes, tournaments or internships. So you're not trying to paint a picture based on their personal life, you are getting them into an environment where they can develop and exhibit certain competencies that you care about.\" Talent Rank is still in the pre-launch phase and is running closed trials with specific partners. The London-based startup has been predominantly funded by friends, family and a fair amount of bootstrapping so far. Talent Rank is attracting lots of interest in the London startup scene and from major employers in key verticals though, according to Hassard, and has moved into Accenture's 2016 fintech Innovation Lab.

      "content": "The UK is keen to position itself as a hub for education technology (EdTech) that will help students and teachers work and learn better in the future. Ian Fordham is the CEO of Edtech UK, the strategic body set up to accelerate growth of the UK's edtech sector, and he sees a booming ecosystem: \"It's an incredibly busy and diverse space. Most people just see apps for schools but our definition of edtech incorporates the whole diverse range of education. So not just school facing but corporate learning and hybrid edtech with other verticals and sectors like fintech, the internet of things (IoT) and digital making, so going down the consumer route.\" Fordham says there are now more than a thousand edtech companies in the UK, and there are still hidden gems that they haven't reached yet. He says: \"We aren't as mature in terms of the USA, and we are really behind in investment, but it is starting to happen and levels of investment are starting to reach Silicon Valley levels.\" Here are some of the best edtech startups in the UK, from scale ups like RefMe and Technology Will Save Us to innovative early-stage companies like Edalytics and Digital Assess. RefME takes the tedium out of compiling citations - and is proving extremely popular with students. The free app works by scanning the book you want to reference to speed up the task of creating, formatting and managing bibliographies.  RefMe raised $5 million (PS3.75 million) in seed round funding in April 2015, led by GEMS Global. This Hackney-based edtech startup blends hardware and software skills for children by selling toys that kids can build and code themselves. Technology Will Save Us has kits for building your own synthesiser, speaker, games console and even a starter soldering kit, with prices starting at PS15 for the BBC micro:bit. The company was dreamed up by husband and wife Daniel Hirschmann and Bethany Koby around their kitchen table in 2012. CEO Koby said last year: \"I'm not sure there has ever been a more exciting time to be building a learning-focused organisation in the UK, and we are thrilled to be leading the charge and championing edtech in this field.\" Technology Will Save Us raised a PS1.2 million seed funding round led by Saatchinvest in December 2015. George Burgess is a 23-year-old British entrepreneur who dropped out from Stanford University to focus on growing edtech startup Gojimo. The exam revision app is available on iOS, Android and the web and offers over 50,000 free curriculum-specific quiz questions to over 300,000 monthly active users. Premium content from the likes of McGraw-Hill Education and Oxford University Press is also available as in-app purchases.  Gojimo previously raised over $1 million (PS630,000) in a seed round led by Index Ventures, which included participation by JamJar Investments (the innocent Drinks founders). Krishan Meetoo, along with his co-founder Carl Dawson, set up Proversity to provide a learning and development environment \"across the employee lifecycle, from attracting talent through to on boarding them by providing the professional and soft skills they need for the role. So try before you buy with candidates,\" Meetoo said. Proversity is working in the corporate learning space, providing an on-demand mobile platform that brings employee attraction, recruitment and retention into one place. Candidates are given a structured learning programme, with each course being designed on a bespoke basis depending on the employer needs. Content can range from text, photos, motion graphics, video walkthroughs and various forms of assessment, from essays to simple check boxes. Proversity raised $1.6 million (PS1 million) in investment from Czech Republic fund RSBC Venture Capital in November 2015 and is planning a PS5-8 million Series A round this year as it expands into the USA, Middle East and ASEAN markets. Learning a new language is really hard, and companies have been trying to make it easier as far back as those giant Rosetta Stone software boxes were being advertised on the TV. UK startup Memrise claims to have cracked the science behind learning and retaining a new language, called 'elaborate encoding.' The platform then reinforces learning by testing and scheduling reminders to keep participants engaged. Memrise has raised more than $6 million (PS4.5 million) in seed and Series A funding so far, led by London VC firm Balderton Capital. London-based Firefly aims to free up teachers' time by simplifying the processes of sifting e-mail for homework, working with a clunky virtual learning environment or copying data into multiple apps that don't communicate. The portal integrates with existing school systems to bring everything into one place. Teachers can issue homework, give feedback and track progress in one place. For students this means being able to submit work at any time, so not having to hand in work while on study leave, for example. It also gives parents an easy way to track their child's progress and timetables. Firefly is already used in 300 schools across the UK and typically charges between PS3,000 and PS10,000 depending on the number of pupils. The startup has so far avoided venture capital. A similar, well established startup is London-based Show My Homework. The clue is in the name, as the platform aims to give teachers their evenings back by bringing time saving reports, instant access to online resources and access to homework into one place. The app also gives parents total visibility of their child's homework and students a place to store and manage all of their homework in one place. Show My Homework is already in more than 1500 schools globally and it raised PS2.4 million in funding from venture capital firm LocalGlobe in January 2017. Wonde is a Cambridge-based startup working to help schools keep their data secure. The platform allows schools to view and manage their data as it is accessed by third party applications. Once in place Wonde enables administrators to allow or deny access to school data and manage existing applications. For developers Wonde supplies an API for access to school data without having to set up agreements with individual organisations. Knowledgemotion's primary product is the boclips platform, which allows education providers to find and embed over two million video clips into their teaching materials without having to deal with tricky licensing issues or multiple content providers. The service is available as a clips library or a white label portal, with usage charged either per stream, or at a flat rate per asset used. Founder David Bainbridge told Techworld that he created Knowledgemotion after asking himself: \"In an education world that is manifestly changing, where textbooks are becoming Chromebooks, why wasn't the content experience in classrooms - from schools to university to corporate training - catching up with the tech delivery opportunity that seemed to be unfolding?\" The company has already signed a supply deal with education content publishers Pearson. Bainbridge says this means \"clips are API integrated into their publishing tool. So when a textbook is being created the author can search and pull in the relevant clip to illustrate the paragraph.\" Knowledgemotion has raised close to PS1.2 million from angel investors and ICG Ventures - part of major textbook publisher Ingram Content Group - and is preparing for a Series A round at the time of writing. London-based startup Pobble is a platform for children's writing, with the aim of encouraging even the most reluctant young writers by opening up a global audience for their published work. There is a school version which can be embedded, with trackable metrics. Pobble claims to be used in 100 countries and has already seen 30,000 pieces published to the platform. Authors Anthony Horowitz and Michael Morpurgo are fans too. Pobble raised PS170,000 in crowdfunding with CrowdCube in 2015, and an additional PS900,000 funding round in February 2016. Digital Assess is trying to change the way students and assessors work together on feedback relating to pieces of work. Assessors can leave contextual feedback, so comments on a single line of music, a specific paragraph or a slide for a project, regardless of file format. The mobile platform lets work be presented as a \"storyboard-style digital portfolio.\" Digital Assess works predominantly with higher education bodies, including Goldsmiths university and Eton college, but also vocational learning and accreditation bodies. Digital Assess raised $3 million (PS2.25 million) from investors including Nesta Impact Investments in June 2015. Fluency focuses on online learning and development courses in digital employability skills, such as analytics, coding, email, CRM, SEO and social media. There are just 25 courses available on the free portal at the time of writing, with each one clearly marked for how long it will take to complete. The aim is that as candidates take on skills and learnings they become more visible to employers. The platform has started pulling through digital jobs so once candidates successfully pass a course they become eligible for jobs through Fluency. The platform also aims to help employers find skilled candidates by designing courses tailored to their needs. Fluency raised $110,000 (PS82,000) in angel investment from Bethnal Green Ventures and Clearly Social Angels back in 2014. London-based startup AVADO focuses on corporate e-learning, teaching employees digital skills through bespoke courses. Lisa Barrett, managing director at AVADO told Techworld that each customer starts out with a face to face meeting with AVADO, where they will \"do a capability audit or assessment around digital skills at the organisation to understand their vision and strategy and where the gaps are for digital ways of working,\" she said. One of these solutions is Dot Native, which allows employees to do short, video-driven learning tasks. \"A key challenge around e-learning is that it doesn't work, it's repetitive and people don't finish. So we have designed bite-sized pieces of learning,\" she said. AVADO builds its learning tools on a highly customised version of the open source Moodle learning technology. The startup has been backed by VC firm Blenheim Chalcot an undisclosed amount. Oxford University graduate Shameer Thobhani has launched Lectus, an iOS-only app which allows students to connect with expert tutors around the world via video calls. The app is still a little buggy and at the time of writing there are only a handful of tutors, charging PS0.40 a minute, but the premise of opening up elite tutors to a broader audience is extremely compelling. Current tutors include a second year biomedical science student at Imperial College London and a 22 year old history and english graduate from Oxford. Subjects include university admissions, languages, history, mathematics, science, economics and geography. Filippo Yacob came up with the idea of Cubetto - a coding toy designed to help children aged three years and up to write their first computer programs - after the birth of his son. Cubetto is a wooden robot which teaches kids to code using blocks instead of screens. Colour coded directional arrows can be placed on the interface board which will direct the Cubetto on a pre-defined path around maps that can be laid on the floor. This apparently teaches children the basics of algorithms, debugging, and recursions. It is a product of London-based startup Primo Toys which raised $1.6 million (PS1.3 million) for the project on Kickstarter last year. Cubetto isn't cheap, retailing at PS159. Teaching the next generation to code is the aim of many a startup, and Code Kingdoms takes a gamification approach, turning glitches into enemies that need to be destroyed. The game uses JavaScript to allow the target audience of 6-13 year olds to create fantasy worlds.  Founders Ross Targett and Hugh Collins came out of the Entrepreneur First graduate accelerator programme and the startup has raised a total of PS280,000 in seed funding from SparkLabs Global Ventures, EF (Entrepreneur First), AngelLab and Neon Adventures. Code Club is a partner of Code Kingdoms and is responsible for events and workshops for 9-11 year olds to learn about coding. Code Club is hosted by the UK charity Raspberry Pi Foundation to encourage more young people to learn coding skills and close the growing technology skills gap.  Kids that attend Code Club will be taught how to programme through fun applications like computer games, animations and websites. Courses start out using Scratch to learn the basics of programming, before graduating to basic web development using HTML and CSS and then advanced skills using established programming languages like Python. Sheffield-based startup Tutora was founded by ex-teacher Scott Woodley and technology analyst Mark Hughes in August 2015. It is a platform for helping parents and students find local, in-person tutors and pay for it without having to handle cash (using Stripe). There are currently around 5,000 tutors across 11 UK cities to choose from, starting at PS15 per hour. Tutors are vetted using their government ID and can be searched by subject, price, customer feedback (a star rating) and proximity. Tutora crowdfunded PS150,000 from 75 investors in April for a 10 percent share in the business. It is currently preparing for a Series A round. Blackbullion seeks to help students and young people take better care of their finances, which in turn helps improve employability. The Blackbullion school edition takes the form of an eight part story and the university version comes in short learning modules based around making informed financial decisions in a non-patronising way. now>press>play is an \"immersive educational resource\" that looks to help primary school children engage with the curriculum through immersive storytelling. In a now>press>play experience each child is given a pair of headphones which will tell an audio story that incorporates learnings, discovery and problem solving. Pricing is bespoke according to the school. Edalytics is based out of the TechHub at Google Campus and is currently in private beta mode with schools. The mysterious startup says that it is: \"Testing technologies such as gamification, cognitive studies, artificial intelligence and data mining to create a unique learning experience for the students.\" ",

      "content": "Last week the UK saw two London-based startups shut up shop: Karhoo and Yubl. Inevitably, commentators have rushed in to decipher why and how these two startups were forced to close. And there is no shortage of Medium posts detailing why such-and-such startup failed, or the lessons learned by its founders along the way. Failure can be a subjective term, and so can some of the statistics around startup failures. Many industry estimates have startups failing at a rate of between 75-90 percent depending on who you believe. Either way, that's not a great figure. In basic terms we mean a startup has closed down operations, but 'failure' could also mean that it didn't return on investment, or that it pivoted so hard away from its initial aim that it became a new startup altogether. For example, is Stewart Butterfield's Slack a startup success story, or was Glitch a failure? It isn't black and white. What's more, startups, like any endeavour, don't fail for a single reason. CB Insights outlines this at the very start of its 20 reasons that startups fail report: \"One - there is rarely one reason for a single startup's failure. And two - across all these failures, the reasons are very diverse.\" The whole report is required reading for anyone in the industry.  Here is a quick run down of the most commonly cited reasons for a startup failing, and hopefully how to avoid making the same mistakes. CB Insights data shows that a massive 42 percent of startups that took part in its survey cited \"lack of a market need for their product\" as the reason for failure, making it the most significant reason cited. The report states: \"Tackling problems that are interesting to solve rather than those that serve a market need was cited as the number one reason for failure\". The technology may be brilliant, but if you have no clear route to market your startup is destined to fail. Basically, if you don't have a clear business plan the idea isn't worth protecting. George Northcott, head of business development at London startup accelerator Founders Factory, says: \"Lots of startups we see find themselves building products that no one wants or there was no market need for. Make sure your company solves a problem and that that problem is big enough to be worth paying for it to be solved.\" This is a similar reason for failure, but with some subtle differences. The recent rise of the artificial intelligence or machine learning startup is a good example of smart founders scrambling to find ways to apply the technology to a specific domain, with extremely mixed results. Most AI startups today, with a few notable exceptions, still feel extremely early stage and have very few actual customers. This is an experience Robert Tregaskes had first hand with his (now defunct) startup Shnergle. \"Fundamentally our business model just wasn't going to work. We couldn't pivot to something adjacent as there wasn't really anything adjacent,\" he says.  Andrew Griffin from Oakhall Advisors says: \"Jumping on a bandwagon business model is not a business plan. Describing yourself as \"SaaS\" or \"The Uber of....\" (recent favourites) is not actually describing what you do, who your customers are, or how you make money.\" A favourite term of Silicon Valley is 'burn rate'. This is the rate at which a startup spends money on overheads before generating a profit. Burn rate isn't necessarily a killer (Uber is burning cash at a historic rate) but it can't be left unattended to. \"Think in your personal life, how much money you could waste eating out or going to parties. Now imagine that, but running a company: paying salaries, paying for services, lawyers and rent. You can start burning some serious cash extremely fast. It doesn't matter how rich you are, you can burn all of it if you aren't careful. Even if you're minted I'd take a very cost-conscious approach. Because if you don't you're either reckless or an arsehole,\" Tregaskes says.  Griffin from Oakhall Advisors says: \"I don't have a problem with years of forecast losses as long as there's a plan to make money at some point, and a good handle on cash burn in the mean time. The closure of Zirtual last year I think marked peak financial illiteracy in the startup world, when the CEO said: \"Burn is a tricky thing that isn't discussed much in Silicon Valley...if you earn $100 but pay out $150, your burn is $50\". It is tempting during the good times to bolster your team, with headcount often being equated to successful growth. Hiring talent creates good feeling and can boost morale.  However, as Farah Kanji, head of talent at startup accelerator Founders Factory said: \"I see 'dead wood' as a reason for startup failure. Firing is just as important as hiring great people. As soon as you realise you've hired the wrong person, let them go. No matter how hard it is to find their replacement.\" Alistair Shepherd, founder at recruitment tech startup Saberr said: \"Life at a startup often means working in small teams, in close quarters and within highly stressful environments. Interpersonal relationships and team dynamics often fall low down the priority list for startup founders and managers, but this shouldn't be the case.\" Tinder cofounder Sean Rad and Twitter's Jack Dorsey may have managed to get back in after being ousted from their startups, but being forced out of your own company is a serious concern for founders. It has been brilliantly depicted in TV and film (my personal favourites? Eduardo Saverin being forced out of Facebook in The Social Network, Steve Jobs leaving Apple in Steve Jobs and the fictional struggles of Cameron Howe on the criminally underrated Halt and Catch Fire). There are many reasons why this happens: not being up to the task, being a better engineer than a leader, backing investors into a corner or just plain arrogance. What you tend to hear from successful startups is that balance is important: every Jobs needs a Woz; and if you have the perfect founding team, try not to antagonise your investors. You may think you are building a brilliant, unique product, but no startup is created in a vacuum and sometimes you just have to launch in beta to see what you have and avoid being beaten to market. Your idea may end up creating the market, but that doesn't mean you will be immune to its forces. Personal finance startup Wesabe was quicker to market than Mint in the early 2000s, but never capitalised on being first, allowing Mint to swoop in and dominate. Mint was eventually acquired for $170 million, while Wesabe had to shut down. One of the more cautionary tales of the last year in Silicon Valley has been Elizabeth Holmes and the health tech startup Theranos, which is currently being investigated by federal prosecutors. Theranos burned brightly since being founded by a nineteen-year old Holmes in 2003, being valued at a 'what on earth were they thinking' $9 billion dollars at its peak, until it all came tumbling down. Nick Bilton has detailed how the house of cards came down for Vanity Fair here, but in a nutshell Holmes overpromised on what her technology could do in the hope that she could get it to work somewhere along the way. She failed. A legal challenge can range from being a minor distraction, like having to change your name, to effectively halting your entire business. UK Martech startup Yieldify was accused of stealing and copying code from Bounce Exchange in the USA and has had to concentrate a huge amount of effort on fighting these court battles instead of its core business over the past year before settling in July. The experience didn't kill them, but it probably didn't make them stronger. CB Insights notes the example of music startups like Turntable.fm having to spend their time and money fighting against rights infringements rather than acquiring customers in the tricky music streaming industry.

      "content": "Raising money from venture capitalists is a critical hurdle many rapid-growth startups will face at some point in their life.  But the wealthy venture capitalist firms are inundated with thousands of pitches from enthusiastic young tech companies every year. Entrepreneurs are so desperate to tap into the billions of pounds floating around these establishments that they'll go to great lengths in order to get their business plan under the nose of a top investor. This constant bombardment can frustrate investors to the extent that they never want to hear about particular companies again. Beyond pitches, VCs will also invest in startups off the back of their own thematic research into sectors or industries where they believe disruptive companies can emerge.  They also fund companies that are referred to them through their network of current and former portfolio companies, VC industry colleagues, angel investors and advisors. Basically, who you know can be just as important as what you know. As Ari Newman, partner at Techstars puts it: \"Try to find someone in your network who can introduce you to a VC. If you have no one who can introduce you, go back to networking.\" To give you the best chance of succeeding in your pitch, Techworld has compiled a list of practical dos and don'ts for pitching a VC, following talks with some of the industry's leading tech venture capital houses.   Tips from: Ari Newman, partner at Techstars; James Wise, principal at Balderton Capital; Ben Holmes, investor at Index Ventures; and Charlie Graham-Brown, of SeedStars World. Now you know what not to do, here's what you should do. ",

      "content": "When we think of a pitch, we think of slick presentations, mounts of stats and a peppering of sales speak. But for Techstars partner Ari Newman and Presence Capital founder Phil Chen, VC pitches should be authentic, well researched and short. \"I don't really have a systematic way of going about discovering entrepreneurs,\" Phil Chen tells Techworld. \"There is no machine learning looking at the pitches, at the end of the day you're talking to a human being,\" he adds. Speaking to Techworld at Web Summit in Lisbon, Ari Newman and Phil Chen offered practical tips on how to approach Venture Capitalist firms.  The phrase 'it's about who you know not what you know' is still alive and kicking for VCs and for most the best way to get VC funding is to get recommended. \"I get referrals from people that I trust so in that sense, there is no science to it, it's more of an art,\" says Chen.  \"If you don't have a lot of brand recognition, it's hard to get recognition with VCs. The first thing is not to see it as a transaction but to see it as building relationships,\" Newman tells Techworld. Understanding not only how VCs work but the relationship you're entering into is crucial to securing VC funding and making better business decisions.  \"I think a lot of entrepreneurs don't understand gravity of taking someone else's money, then they wonder why investors have an opinion about things and get frustrated when you don't react to their advice,\" says Newman. \"If you want cheap easy money that isn't going to start a clock ticking down straight away, don't go to a VC,\" adds Newman. Any business pitch, interview or presentation can fall apart of you don't have a strong understanding of your field. This is the same for VC pitches. \"The biggest turn offs are those that you can tell don't have depth or understanding of the space. Maybe they've read a few articles about the space and got excited about it but at the end of the day, entrepreneurs fail because they lack depth,\" says Chen. \"If they lack a depth of knowledge of their particular space [startups] don't even know why a VC is not interested in them,\" he adds. Unsurprisingly, VCs receive a lot of pitches and will see though any startup founders that lack enthusiasm in both the pitch and the business.  \"I think the better pitches are thoughtful and take an interesting perspective on things. That's always a good starting point,\" says Chen. \"Great investors are generally great readers of people. They have excellent bullshit detectors and excellent pattern recognition. You know when there's not enough data and too much story,\" says Newman. \"I've sat in meetings before where an entrepreneur is talking and I'm 20 minutes in and I think, I don't care if you're going to be a billion dollar company, I don't know what you're saying and I don't click with you,\" he adds. Like going for a new job, startups should make sure their experience is highlighted and they supports your pitch throughout. \"One of the first things we do is look at their experience. Are they credible? Not only should they have a big vision but can they do what the actually say they can do?\" says Chen. Keeping things simple is the best way to put your point across and secure the respect of the VCs you're pitching to. \"If you can't express what you believe in one or two lines in a clear way then you probably don't understand it, you don't understand the problem, you don't understand your own product and you don't know how to get it to market,\" says Chen. \"Investors know when they're being told what they want to hear. You have to cut out all of the fluff and just get to the data points that are going to matter. \"So do you have real proof that you have a product fit for market? Tell me why your team is awesome, what you've done together, how much progress you've made and in what period of time and if you have any clue what leverage you're going to pull at each round of funding,\" says Newman. Separating your startup to the countless others being pitched to VCs will highlight your understanding of not only your business model but of others, and will be a great way to prove to the VC why your startup is better. \"You get a lot of the same pitches so then you have to ask them how they are different from others. And if they can't explain that then that means you don't have enough depth of knowledge of your competitors, what others are doing in this space,\" says Chen. A two or three minute video will be light relief for VCs and break the cycle of long pitches. \"Videos are an easy way of communicating what you're doing to the VCs. If you think about it I might get 25 pitches a day and if I were to be fair I can only spend about 5 minutes on one so that's over three hours a day on new companies and only just to see if I should spend more time on them. So that one line or two minute video explains what you do, what you problem is and what your solution is,\" says Chen. ",

      "content": "Academics in technology fields are benefiting more than ever before from licensing deals and the sale of spinoff companies, new research has found. Universities in the UK have increased their income from intellectual property (IP) by 18.5 percent year on year (YoY), pulling in PS155 million during 2014-15, research data by the Higher Education Funding Council for England shows. The findings show that UK universities are becoming savvier than ever when it comes to licensing IP, with income from licensing deals alone rising 25 percent YoY to a total of PS103 million. This compares to the PS53 million made in shares from the sale of spinoff companies over the same time period. The difference between a licensing deal and a spinout comes down to ownership of the core IP. With a licensing deal the university maintains ownership of the IP and licenses it out. Think of it as IP-as-a-Service. A spinout sees the IP transfer over to the buyer and will usually see a leading academic follow the IP as part of the deal. Think how Demis Hassabis joined Google parent company Alphabet as part of the DeepMind deal. The important part here is how UK universities are protecting their IP better, and using the rewards to further their research efforts. The study shows that the higher education sector as a whole received almost five times as much income from licensing and spinoff equity in 2014-15 as it spent on IP protection.  Joanna Thurston, partner and patent attorney at intellectual property law firm Withers & Rogers said: \"A few years ago, just a handful of universities were actively filing patents or registered designs, but now such activity is commonplace, particularly in sectors such as life sciences, software and consumer electronics. \"More universities understand that licensing deals and opportunities to profit from spinout businesses can only be secured if the right IP protection is in place; providing reassurance that inventions cannot be copied by competitors.\" Practically, academics have to work with the tech transfer office to protect and commercialise their ideas. Thurston's first piece of advice is a simple one: \"You need to avoid disclosing the idea before you seek a patent.\" Then you must lay out a clear route to market. This will make the process of drafting a patent document simpler. Thurston admits that it is expensive to protect IP, and \"there is always a risk, but the attorney and technology transfer office will do pre-analysis to minimise those risks\". Finally, one key decision is where to file the patent. Thurston says that \"you can tie up the world with US, Europe, Japan and China\" protection. US tech giants like Google and Apple have already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on UK startups that developed their intellectual property within UK universities. Demis Hassabis, cofounder of Deepmind - which Google acquired in 2014 for $600m - developed the deep learning techniques which underpin the company while studying at Cambridge and University College London. It remains unknown how much UCL was paid for any owned IP resulting from this deal.  In late 2015 Apple acquired Vocal IQ, a Cambridge University spinout for its AI-driven natural language processing prowess. A lesser-known case is Arria NLG, a natural language processing startup that was spun out from the University of Aberdeen in 2009 and was valued at PS160 million in 2013. The one constant here is the rise in AI- and machine learning-related activity in the sector. The complex technology behind AI and machine learning lends itself to academia, and with the rise of interest in AI from the tech sector and enterprise this sort of activity isn't a surprise.  It is difficult to know if this is sustainable or a recent boom though. What is clear is that the technology sector is catching up with life sciences when it comes to seeing the value in academic IP. The Spin Outs UK annual report noted: \"For four out of the past five years, more than half the new spinouts created have been in the life sciences sector. In 2015 the ICT and digital sector accounted for 30 percent of spinouts.\" Jonathan Harris, editor at the Spinouts UK Project told Techworld: \"The market sector codes in which we would expect to find AI/machine learning companies do appear to have experienced an increase in numbers over the past two years.\" Spinouts may be benefiting more than ever from the market, but the number of university spinouts in the UK is actually declining. Harris said: \"Spinouts have been declining for a number of reasons. One is that the peak period for spinout formation followed the creation of the government-backed University Challenge Funds.\" Harris also explained that universities recognise that creating a viable spinout is time and money intensive, \"Some universities do not see this sort of commercial preparation as being either their responsibility or their area of expertise,\" he said. On the other hand, growing numbers of university staff and graduates are building startups of their own, \"especially from computer science and similar departments, because they can get to market more quickly, have fewer costs to reach a marketable product, and don't have to negotiate transfer of IP,\" said Harris. Thurston from Withers & Rogers sees the shift as more cultural, with academics no longer viewing licensing deals as 'selling out'. She explained: \"It was seen as a negative thing to pander to industry or make money from research. You would encounter academics that give you a hard time when you encourage them to protect their innovation. \"Now, because of tech transfer offices, collaboration is seen as a good thing because they have come round to the fact that it is great to see a real-world result of that research.\"  Alice Jacques, senior data scientist, consumer insight at Channel 4 sees the ties between researchers and business as more of a necessity than an evolution. \"My sense is that the links are becoming more common, especially as government funding becomes more difficult to obtain,\" she told Techworld. Jacques also had a word of warning against this level of cosiness: \"Naturally there are risks associated with the relationship between industry and academia becoming too close,\" she said. \"Business-sponsored research has a skew towards the applied, so perhaps a less long-term view.\" ",

      "content": "In the startup community, the do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to bootstrapping a business is NOT the most celebrated concept. It is considered inefficient and risk-ridden and, I dare say, not at all sexy. But myths are made to be debunked. Bootstrapping isn't always a surefire route to burnout and hitting the deadpool. It can be a path to creating real businesses, small or large, that can support their founders and employees. Over the last 16 years of bootstrapping and running two profitable businesses, I've learned my fair share of lessons. And through my success and failures, I can confidently say that bootstrapping is a viable method. With all the tools and resources out there, the right strategies and sheer persistence, you have a good chance to succeed. My entrepreneurial journey began back in 2000. I was completing my last semester as a Biology major at the University of Maryland, a couple years after being diagnosed with a debilitating autoimmune illness called Crohn's Disease, all along clueless about where I was headed with my career. My friends were getting ready for summer vacation and preparing for graduate school, while I was forced to drop out of college and ended up stuck at home, nearly bedridden.  I was on a ridiculously strict diet and several medications. I was months away from achieving remission and getting back to normal life. It was one of those moments in which I felt I was reaching rock bottom, both personally and career wise. I had two options: do nothing and let time go to waste; or own the situation and put all of my free time to better use. This is when I received my first lesson as a DIY entrepreneur: Starting a venture doesn't require a lot of material resources. Your most important asset is unbridled enthusiasm and abundant persistence.  I had $170 in my bank account, an old desktop computer with a big fat VGA monitor, and a lot of time. It turned out to be more than enough to start creating something from nothing; a sort of baby step that led me to start the two companies I continue to run today. While I was low on resources, timing worked in my favor. The turn of the millennium presented unprecedented growth opportunities for the internet. It was the time for businesses to go online. Y2K thankfully didn't trigger the end of technology as we know it, and, as many have predicted, the netizen population was growing exponentially, and thousands of dotcom startups and billions of dollars were meeting face to face. My intuition told me it was the right time to start an internet business, and I came up with this idea: Set up coupon pages for businesses so that their customers could print out special offers from the web. Then came lesson number two: Things won't go as planned, but don't overlook the opportunities that come with change.  After a few weeks of rejection, a turning point happened: a local business owner called and asked me to design a website for him. \"Sorry, that's not what I do,\" I explained to him. \"What I offer is an online coupon page and you pay me a fee to host it online.\" With an incredulous gasp he said: \"Why the heck would I want that? I want my own website! How much would that be?\" That was the third most important lesson I've learned: Give your customer what they want, and not what you think they would want.  I thought to myself: Why in the world am I selling $99 coupon pages when this business (and probably many others like it) would be happy to pay me more to have their own site?  Today \"validating your business model early and often\" is widely adopted and recommended by the startup community. Back in the early 2000s, I learned validation the hard way. I wasted a lot of time and resources due to the habit of jumping right into an idea when I saw an ocean of opportunities. When it comes to actually delivering what my client wanted, I was clueless. I had never took a class on design or worked on a design project. But as a DIY entrepreneur, I had set my mind on creating and learning everything myself, including teaching myself web design. It took me more than 150 hours and countless revisions to deliver a small static five-page website that got me my first hard earned $800. Looking back I had earned below minimum wage. But the important lesson number four I learned here is priceless: As a DIY entrepreneur, you don't have to learn everything yourself.   The DIY attitude is a double-edged sword. The figuring-out-on-my-own mentality was a little egotistical when I was younger. HindSite Interactive- the web design agency I ended up running - went on to deliver over 350 custom websites over the next 15 years. But I admit: I would have avoided much wasted time and effort if I had sought out for some advice rather than learning it through trial and error. Eventually, I figured out a process whereby clients would offer input early on to achieve a design that both sides would be happy with. Had I been exposed to the user-centric design process sooner, these wasted efforts would have been avoided. There is one thing I'm proud to have figured out very early on. Putting in hard work to service your customers is the foundation of a successful business. So here is my lesson number five: take damn good care of your customers, and they will take care of you. Happy customers become your evangelists. They're the ones who will keep coming back for more and generate new business leads and help you grow organically. This powerful lesson of customer retention certainly served me well in my second venture into the software-as-a-service (SaaS) business, where the human interaction of client-facing work pretty much disappears, and the user experience of the software product carries the brunt of the weight in customer decision making. But first, let me walk you through what sparked my transition from a service-based business into a SaaS business. HindSite was delivering interactive websites built on Adobe Flash. This went on for eight years until Apple came out and killed Adobe Flash as the way interactive content was designed. It took me a year to realise that flash sites were going nowhere after HindSite started taking a hit in business. Then this sixth lesson dawned on me: When a technology wave comes, instead of fighting it, ride with it. As a DIY entrepreneur, resilience is the ability to quickly adapt to change and not resist it. Change might seem scary when you have to step away from your comfort zone. In my case, a business I'd built from scratch, but it was necessary to evolve. That's how Visme came about. It's a do-it-yourself online tool that is a perfect marriage between key features of Powerpoint and a design tool to allow virtually anyone to create beautiful presentations, infographics, social and web graphics, among other types of visual content. A user-based cloud software business model is fundamentally different from that of a design consultancy: it's not based on how many hours you work but how good of a product you develop and how you gain and maintain user interactions.  What's also changed is how profitability works for this business model. For a consulting business you are profitable as long as clients are happy to pay a fee that's greater than your labour and operational costs. It's a straightforward formula. For SaaS, revenue comes from premium subscriptions. For a premium model, where only a percentage of free users will convert to paying users, the Lifetime Value (LTV) is varied across different user types. So the profitability math here is a lot more complex than a service-based business: There are more variables in this formula. This is my seventh lesson as a software entrepreneur: Running a SaaS business is like running a marathon. There are milestones but no finish line. Success here is not linear: you will always be optimising all variables of success and investing in R&D to stay ahead of competition. I also learned that every dollar needs to be spent with a purpose. As a DIY SaaS product owner, the single most important mission for me is to make sure the product is market ready and viable to survive regardless of whether or not venture funding is available. I was lucky enough to be in a position where I could support the development and preparation with a profitable service business for two years before we made our first buck with Visme. If you ask me if I would choose to bootstrap my businesses if I had a chance to redo everything again, my answer would be a resounding \"yes.\" I didn't just want a quick in and out with investor money; my vision was to create an awesome product of long-term reliability our users can depend on for all their visual content needs. It isn't the most sexy product idea to sell to investors, and requires a slow start and progressive fine tuning. My eighth lesson is more of a revelation: choosing to bootstrap gives you maximum freedom to make decisions that are best for your users.  At Visme, we don't have to worry about playing up to vanity metrics or paying back early stage investors. As a team, we had the luxury to be single-mindedly focused on improving the tool and the service. With the right strategies and tools in place, you too can bootstrap your way to profitability. And even if you are doing it the DIY way, be open minded to advice and tips. When you have created something great out of nothing, it is a tremendously rewarding experience. ",

To help, we've compiled a list of helpful Google Analytics tips to make the most out of your consumer data. Here's 13 top Google Analytics tips and tricks for your startup... Make sure to check out Google Sheets tips, Google Slides tips and Google Docs tips too. Here's how to monitor the path your consumers have taken from the entrance to the exit of your website: Go to 'behaviour', then 'site content' and finally 'content drilldown'. Like the name suggests, the entrance rate refers to the amount of people that have visited your site. The bounce and exit rate while similar do have some notable differences. The bounce rate refers to users that have visited only one page on your site - not visiting any other pages from that point. Whilst the exit rate factors in additional pages that visitors have, or may have visited before leaving said page. Get email alerts to increased bounce rates, changes in page views and other key metrics. Here's how to do it. Go to 'reporting', then 'intelligence events'. Next select one of the timeframes listed and choose 'create a custom alert'. From there you can create alert conditions. Having a large and loyal audience is vital to a brand's success, so the balance between new and returning visitors should be monitored each week. Here's what to do. Select 'audience' then, 'behaviours'. Next choose, 'new vs returning'. Track which browsers are bringing in the most traffic with this easy tip: Go to 'audience', then 'technology' and finally 'browser and OS'. To find out where your consumers are visiting from couldn't be easier. Go to 'audience', 'geo' and finally, 'location'. Find out how long people are staying on your website and why by following this route: Go to 'audience' then 'behaviour' and finally 'engagement'. Here's how to find out what key terms your consumer typed into search engines that delivered them to your site: Go to 'behaviour', 'site search' and then 'search terms'. If another website provides a link to your site you can find out in a few clicks. Go to 'acquisition' then 'all traffic' and finally 'referrals'. This Google Analytics tip will bring up an image of your webpage and by hovering over links/tabs on the page will highlight how many clicks each have received. Here's what to do: Go to 'behaviour' and then 'in-page analytics'. Here's how to find out which social channels are bringing in the most traffic: Go to 'acquisition' then 'social' and finally 'network referrals'. Here's how to check your site speed: Go to 'behaviour' then 'site speed'. Your internal search bar might be getting more attention than you think. Here's how to check: Go to 'content' then 'site search' and finally 'overview'. Any visitor is great, but building an interactive community with frequent visitors is important and valuable. Go to 'audience' then 'behaviour' and finally 'frequency and recency'. ",

      "content": "Artificial intelligence has long since moved from the realms of science fiction into the tools we use every day, be it in the software we use at work or on our smartphones. However, there is a new wave of startups emerging who want to take AI even further, allowing it to make decisions for us, be it setting up meetings, responding to our messages or even buying things on our behalf. These startups want AI to become our social organiser, personal assistant, concierge - even our best friend. Here are the AI companies worth watching out for in this space. Viv is an AI assistant cofounded by the creators of Siri: Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham. The trio founded Viv in 2012 after Siri was acquired by Apple in 2010.  It allows developers to plug into and create an intelligent, conversational interface for anything. By connecting to a huge, global network, the founders say Viv will be able to perform a potentially endless list of tasks.  The startup raised $30 million in three rounds from four different investors, before being sold to Samsung in October 2016 for an undisclosed sum.  Asteria claims its product is 'the world's first AI companion that you carry with you'. The pocket-sized device, set to ship in spring 2017, 'sees what you see, hears what you hear, takes in life as you do, and gets smarter all along the way'. Cofounders Nathan Ross and Dan Gailey hope to encourage a large community of developers to build on top of the device, creating apps and features to boost its abilities further. The startup was founded in July 2016. No funding information is currently available.   Amy, built by x.ai, is described as an 'AI powered personal assistant for scheduling meetings'. When you get a meeting request, if you cc in [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */, the AI will coordinate a time you can make with your guest for you. It costs $39 a month, or it's free for five uses each month. x.ai was founded in April 2014 and has raised $34.3 million in three rounds from 11 investors. Cleo describes its app as 'an intelligent assistant for your money'. Its AI integrates with your bank accounts to deliver relevant insights into your finances and help you save more cash. The startup was founded in November 2015 by Alexandra Wozniak and Barnaby Hussey-Yeo, as part of that year's Entrepreneur First cohort. It is currently in public beta. Unloop is billed as a 'personal lifestyle enhancement AI' by founder Noach Ben-Haim. The idea is for Unloop's AI to learn about the user, build up a personality profile, then use this to suggest new activities, experiences, places and connections - helping people to break out of their monotonous daily routine. The startup launched in March 2016, with a beta version of the app set to launch in November 2016. ",

The government promoted open data not just to support transparency but also to boost economic growth, thanks to the new startups it anticipated would be launched to exploit the newly-available data. The Open Data Institute, launched in 2012, has taken the leading role in helping UK startups that use open data to flourish (many of which are listed here), alongside its pioneering work in promoting, training and connecting those within the open data community.  Here are 19 of the most innovative examples of companies that use or produce open data... 'Big data done better'. Mastodon C aim to provide agile big data insights in a sustainable way. Their platforms Kixi and Hecuba pool real-time data to aggregate, model or analyse it and feed the information back to businesses. The platforms are run via the cloud (usually AWS) and aim to provide business insights to aid daily business operations. Previously, Mastodon C reportedly found a potential PS200 million worth of savings for the NHS. British national newspaper, The Guardian uses open data in a pretty interesting way. Since 2009, the newspaper has published its raw data for partners to reuse via an API. Partners are given access to all that the content The Guardian creates, equating to over 1.5 million news articles since 1999. This enables users to build external applications in return for carrying Guardian advertising. CarbonCulture is an open platform designed to help people and businesses use resources more efficiently. The UK startup monitors workplace carbon use and suggests ways to improve efficiency and save money. CarbonCulture works with the Cabinet office, 10 Downing Street, Tate Modern, University College London and Cardiff Council (to name a few).   Back in 2011, global online fashion and beauty retailer Asos opened its data to external web developers. In a bid to extend its online presence, Asos has opening up its product and basket API making it easier for third-party websites to integrate better with and lead potential customers back to the Asos site. Arup, a UK-based global engineering consultancy, uses open data as a vital part of its work with smart cities and the technology that supports them. Working on how to use public data about traffic, planning, natural hazards and other topics to deliver more efficient services and help mitigate against risks, for example of natural disasters.  Adzuna is a search engine that aggregates job adverts from several hundred different online sources. It uses open data in the form of labour market statistics for its Job Index, which provides an overview of the UK jobs market. It also provides free access to its job data via an API, all run by just 25 staff in south west London.  PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), is the second largest professional services firms in the world with a network of firms in around 157 countries.  PWC enables open data research and provides analysis of projects for the Open Data Challenge Series, a number of challenges aimed at promoting sustainable open data services to tackle social problems.  Doorda is a startup that brings together different government datasets into a single online map. This helps citizens better understand public data on their local area, such as properties, schools, crime hotspots, local news and road safety. The company, which has just five employees, also consults firms on how to use open data.  FoodTrade is an online platform that brings together over 1,600 local food producers with consumers to map supply chains and promote transparency in the food sector. The Bristol-based startup recently launched FoodTrade.Menu, an automatic allergen labeller that uses Food Standards Agency data to help restaurants ensure their menus comply with allergy rules.  GeoLytix is a startup specialising in geospatial data and consultancy. It uses data from Transport for London, the Land Registry, OpenStreetMap and various Whitehall departments to create 'geodata products' such as maps, boundary data and points of interest. It then releases some of these products as open data, including processed census data, workplace data, supermarket locations and postal sector boundaries. They have worked with Boots, Asda and Barclays, to name a few. Mime Consulting offers management information services like data warehousing, analysis, visualisations and dashboard design.

      "content": "What was previously the press centre in London's Olympic Park is being transformed into one of the biggest tech hubs in Europe. BT Sport has its headquarters on the site (named 'Here East), Loughborough University has set up a London campus there, UCL is set to unveil 'UCL East' which will host its robotics department and there is a huge PS120 million data centre run by Infinity. There's also plans for a 'cultural quarter' nearby, with a presence for the V&A, Sadler's Wells and the Smithsonian Institute. They are now set to be joined by a huge 68,000 square foot tech 'innovation centre'. Techworld took a tour of the site this week led by the centre's CEO Claire Cockerton (pictured below). The centre, named 'Plexal', is set to launch in May 2017. It seems a slightly unrealistic timescale given the site is virtually bare currently, and it's a deadline that's moved a number of times previously (it was originally due to open in July 2015). So watch this space. However the plans for it are ambitious. \"This is the most connected building in Europe, thanks to it being the Olympic press centre,\" Cockerton says. \"We have three fibre optic cable banks here.\" \"The concept is of a mini city with lots of startups based here, and a makers' lab with 3D printing facilities, plus shops and tons of office spaces,\" she explains. There will be offices that can accommodate companies from four to 30 people, plus some open co-working space. However, the real selling point, Cockerton claims, will be not the office space but the surrounding services. Startups based here will have easy access to corporate accelerators, and discounted PR, law and recruitment services, plus entrepreneurship courses, she says. Prices start at PS200 per month per desk. It looks fairly bare at the moment, but Cockerton says they have had a \"huge influx of interest\" and already have six companies working out of a pop-up space on the floor above, set up as a temporary area before they are moved down to the site when it launches. The site is a walk away from Stratford and thus will benefit from being connected to Crossrail, a new train line set to launch in 2018, linking Shenfield to Reading via central London. There is, of course, one elephant in the room: Brexit. It's hard to avoid the fact that London-based startups and tech companies face a very uncertain future, at least in the short term. Could this have an impact? Cockerton is honest: \"We are worried about Brexit. Access to the single market is crucial to being seen as the global fintech capital.\" However, she remains relentlessly upbeat and enthusiastic. And the idea of a community where tech, startups, broadcasting, the arts and innovation intermingle is a compelling vision. If they pull it off successfully, it will undoubtedly be the most exciting tech development in London next year. ",

      "content": "Both Habito and Trussle were born from an acute consumer frustration with the existing mortgage process. \"We shouldn't have to think about mortgages. They are soul crushing, dull things that bring nobody any pleasure,\" the founder and CEO of Habito Daniel Hegarty told Techworld over coffee this week. Oli West, brand and content manager at Trussle, focuses on the mortgage broker themselves as the source of pain: \"There is lots of paperwork, calls after hours, working to their schedule not yours.\" By making the entire process digital both startups say they can save you time, stress and money. Hegarty says that both his company and Trussle are \"trying to solve the same consumer problem\" but that where Habito stands out is its commitment to providing a \"totally digital experience\" to customers. Trussle would counter that, with CEO and founder Ishaan Malhi telling Techworld: \"Many of our customers are happy for their entire experience to be online, but there are still many who prefer a friendly voice at the end of the phone. We've used technology to automate as much of the admin as possible so our advisers have more time to spend with our customers.\" Both startups have some bold claims for consumers. Habito says it can get you a mortgage seven times quicker than a human broker. Trussle says it can get you a quote in three minutes instead of an hour, on average. Both startups are Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approved and don't charge the customer, making money by taking 0.35 percent procurement fees from the lenders. Who wins will come down to scale and winning hearts and minds. Side by side, their home pages look extremely similar, with both sites offering two simple options: buy a home, or save on an existing mortgage. Once you click through you are given a web-form to fill out and get an instant quote. This is where the experience differs slightly. From here Habito works primarily through a chatbot interface, with some web-forms, whereas Trussle uses a more traditional web-form process and issues you a mortgage in principle to show estate agents when you are looking at homes. The traditional mortgage process involves either going to your bank, shopping around yourself, or using a high street broker, which involves phone calls, meetings and lots of paperwork.  Hegarty explains that Habito's chatbot simply seemed like the best format for helping customers, and that it is only as powerful as the underlying database and models they have. \"The chatbot is helping you build a query for your data set,\" he explained. \"So we build parameters for specific customers so we can query this lovely clean database we have created.\" The data is the important part when it comes to providing customers with the right mortgage, as the lenders aren't the most tech savvy organisations, with many of them not having APIs or data feeds to plug into. This meant that Hegarty and his team had to do a lot of the heavy lifting themselves early on. When Hegarty nearly lost his dream home because of a stream of clerical errors he started to ask around and see if the system could be automated to cut out the human aspect of mortgage brokerage. When he looked he found \"nothing. No aggregated eligibility or affordability\". The key word here is aggregated, and this was the hardest part for Hegarty. He began mapping the broker pools and spidering data from the various websites to aggregate the data across the industry. \"Sat in your kitchen you think how difficult can it be? But it is pretty fucking difficult,\" he says. \"It is like being a librarian. It is not fun, exciting work\". Now Habito's database is powered by aggregators like IRESS and another unnamed data provider daily, so that Habito's chatbot can search around 60 UK lenders for the best deal. Habito then automates the application itself by mapping lender's intermediary portals, \"to allow us to check their eligibility and affordability criteria\", Hegarty said.  Trussle on the other hand aggregates mortgage products via an API feed provided by a specialist company, and works with the Mortgage Advice Bureau (MAB), giving it access to roughly 90 UK lenders. It then layers its own algorithms on top to help find customers the most suitable mortgage. Both startups offer a mortgage tracking service off the back of these databases to ensure that customers are always getting the best deal. West from Trussle says: \"We did a survey a few months ago that showed 60 percent of mortgage owners haven't remortgaged because they find the process overwhelming, but on average they are losing PS2,800 a year stuck on a standard variable rate where they could have remortgaged onto another fixed rate.\" No one has succeeded at becoming a trusted brand in the mortgage brokerage space, with most UK residents unable to name more than one. Much like the new breed of UK challenger banks, Habito and Trussle hope that their modern, digital approach, and some savvy marketing can change that. Where Trussle may have the jump on Habito, at least in the short term, is its relationship with property aggregator Zoopla and its massive audience of potential buyers. Naturally, Hegarty isn't too sure though, saying: \"If you are completely dependent on a third party in terms of [customer] acquisition that leads to problems down the line.\" ",

      "content": "The calendar could be the best tool your business or startup has and industry leader Google Calendar - if used right - could make your business and personal life better, or at least more efficient.  Apple and Microsoft will doubtless disagree but after nearly ten years Google's Calendar is arguably now the most featured of all the online calendars for business use. Unfortunately, it's also a small labyrinth of settings and hidden gems few ever get to see. But for home and business users who have a Gmail account, it can function not simply as a static event system but an entire time management platform into which colleagues can be integrated with minimum fuss. Better your business with these Google Calendar tips.  Little used perhaps but OK Google can be used to set up simple Calendar events, useful when using a smartphone with a small screen. Speak 'create event' after tapping Ok Google icon and it will ask questions to populate the location and event name fields. Might take a few minutes to appear in the online Calendar. Must be enabled in Chrome on desktop PCs. Travel a lot for work? If so, this trick is a quick way reducing the chance of being caught in a hail storm while getting all your event details. Here's how to do it:  Click the gear symbol, then select 'settings'. From there scroll down to 'show weather based on my location' and choose celsius or fahrenheit. Simple. One of the most important principles of calendaring is using multiple calendars, which allows personal, business and departmental appointments to be kept separate or shared as need be. These can be created from the 'my calendars' drop down. Alternatively, calendars can be shared with specific people. Numerous third-party calendars can also be imported and viewed or switched off as needed. Google nixed the 'smart rescheduler' function but it still exists in a different form through the 'find the time' tab. Create or edit an event and use this function to find a free time in all calendars shared with you. This works for up to 20 shared calendars. Rooms for meetings with their capacities (depending on how many were invited) are also viewable. Responses can be checked later inside the event. Depending on your line of work, you may wish to show people your availability and embedding your calendar (or one of them) on your website is a great a pretty easy way of doing so. Here's how to do it. Go to the gear icon and visit settings. Next, select the 'calendar' tab at the top of the page and choose the calendar you want to embed. Finally, copy the text in the embed section.  A useful but buried feature is to receive a daily email digest of all Calendar events, a handy way to stop them sneaking up on you. Accessed by clicking the gear icon > settings> calendars>edit notifications (on right hand side of screen, choosing correct account) tick 'daily agenda' box, then hit 'save'. Another issue is making specific calendars (i.e. personal and work) synchronise (share) with one another. This can be convenient, for example allowing a user to view work calendar appointments on the Google account tied to their smartphone without having to leave that account. Note, some organisations may disallow some fields on security grounds. Sadly, Google killed the old PC connector for Microsoft Outlook. Time zones used to trip up Google Calendar users but no more. The first tip is to add more time zones (Settings and select Show an additional time zone) to avoid miscalculation when scheduling meetings in different zones. The settings/labs tab also offers a world clocks feature which will display chosen time zones. Calendar will adopt a device's time zone when travelling to that location. Google Calendar enables its users to customise its viewable hours. Most working hours are nine to five so let's assume that there are no meetings or events between 9pm and 6am. Inactive times can be hidden under settings > Labs. Essential for users of Google's cloud-based Chromebook, offline mode can also be enabled for any platform via the gear icon > offline. Incredibly useful when away from a reliable internet connection although the feature requires the user to use Google's Chrome browser. The mobile app caches Calendar automatically so doesn't require this mode. Not obvious to some but invites sent to Gmail accounts (or a corporate Gmail domain) can be seamlessly added to Calendar and the reverse is also true. This is done via the 'add: guests' box on the right of the invite page. The Labs tab is now pretty limited. Some of the features are integrated elsewhere while others have disappeared. However, one gripe with Calendar is the ability to quickly reach dates some time in past or future - gear icon> Labs> 'Jump to Calendar' fixes this niggle, allowing specific dates to be specified and reached in one click. When you create a to-do list with Google Calendars it appears right on the calendar with a checkable box for completed tasks.  Q for 'quick add', S for open settings, C for 'create new event', D for 'day view', M for month view, w for week view, E for 'show event details', Ctrl + Z for 'undo last action', Ctrl + S for 'save changes to event', Ctrl + P for 'print calendar'. Shortcuts are enabled by default but can be disabled in settings > General. An obvious worry - users set up a meeting and then share calendaring with outsiders. Calendar offers admins lot of control over this but the tightest level of control is to restrict all event details got this kind of sharing, allowing only free/busy data. This also hides the email addresses of participants. ",

      "content": "The excitement of launching a startup with a great new idea can all too easily leave the minutiae of running a business neglected. The consequences of such an oversight have the potential to sink a company. A crack team of legal experts from PwC UK shared their top tips with Techworld on how to ensure yours isn't one of them. The opportunity to expand on your idea is only a brief one, as the innovative and disruptive idea of today is the outdated orthodoxy of tomorrow, so don't delay when raising funding. \"You'll almost certainly need more than you anticipate, and often it's a bit of an arms race\", says Thomas Colmer, director of the PwC corporate team. Run out of money at the wrong moment and your business could fold. \"When you're using outside assistance to help with the development, these people won't hang around while you get your money ready,\" says Latika Sharma, head of Intellectual Property at PwC. \"If they're not going to be paid, they're not with you anymore.\" \"Focus on what you really need the money for\", Colmer advises. \"Bootstrapping a business is always recommended.\" Don't expect others to take a financial risk on your business if you're not willing to back it yourself. If funds are tight, seek alternative sources of income such as grants and tax credits. \"Often there may be things available like R&D tax credits--which most technology companies will qualify for almost certainly--and that's effectively cashback,\" says Sharma. \"Good advice really pays for itself,\" says Colmer. Relationships can make or break a startup. Think beyond the money and consider what else your partners can offer, whether it's individual expertise or useful connections. Adding an established network to your technology makes an attractive proposition for investors. Consider whether the funder will follow their money when the company gets bigger. Their position will change the dynamics of the business and your plan for progressing it. \"It may be too soon to build those things into contracts\", says Sharma. \"As things develop, you can start entering into more formal arrangements.\" Crowdfunding provides free promotion but its true value depends on the market. \"If you've got a fairly long tail, that can weigh quite heavily on both future fundraises and particularly on exits,\" says Colmer. Investment from one company may preclude investment from their competitors, and if they already have a portfolio company in your area, they may not invest in another one. It could be the technology, the vision or staff. Identify the real value and protect and invest in that. If it's IP, protect it when necessary. Patents and registered designs can only be protected for a limited period, but trademarks can be registered later if kept under wraps. So resist shouting out your secrets and get confidentiality agreements and NDAs [non-disclosure agreements] in place early on. You can't patent software in the UK, but you can patent software-related products. \"Getting advice from a proper patent professional early on is quite sensible,\" says Sharma. \"Most of them will have this conversation without charging you to give you a sense check on it.\" Make it distinctive. Check the name with Google and Companies House, and see if the domain name is available. Research your competitors, as they might have unregistered rights, and complete a trademark search before committing. \"It's relatively cheap, but it's better to get a professional to do that for you\", says Sharma, \"because there's an expertise in interpreting whether the results are going to cause you problems or not.\" Ultimately, a trademark registration process is the only guaranteed protection for your name or logo. As an early-stage company, you'll likely be partnering or selling to bigger businesses, weakening your bargaining power for that first contract. \"You just really need to land one,\" says Stuart Hatcher, a corporate partner at PwC who specialises in fast-growth. \"It gives energy levels to your staff and allows you to work on your product and get further into the market.\" That contract should properly reflect your business model, so don't just copy your competitors. Keep your company in the British business and tax environment and provide straightforward incentives to your staff. Early promises could come back to haunt you on exit. \"You as the founder will probably be eating into your own share because you've already given up a lot of your company,\" says Sharma. \"You should be thinking about the exit as soon as you start your business,\" says Hatcher. \"Do you want to exit, or are you trying to create a business that's going to be a dynasty for years and years?\" Your investors may have more control over that decision than you do. \"If they're going to control it, what protection can you put in place for yourself?\" he adds. \"Family lawyers, when they're talking about marriage, say you should really be thinking about divorce. Think about what's that worst end game.\" Save money in the legal drafting and negotiation process by agreeing a term sheet. It doesn't need to be legally binding or drafted by a lawyer. Protecting IP and talent makes an employment contract an area where professional advice is worth seeking. A good employment contract also means that when staff are no longer up to the job, you needn't be afraid to fire them. \"People will be good for different stages of the business, and that's okay,\" says Colmer. \"It's not disloyal to say we need more help, and it's not a weakness to say I can't do everything.\" ",

      "content": "The first hundred days in the life of a startup come with a range of important decisions. You need to get the idea and the team right first but then there are some very important financial and legal jobs to get done if you are to set yourself on the fast track to long-term success. Here is some advice from legal and financial experts, as well as founders, investors and mentors that have seen it and done it before. Alice Bentinck is the cofounder of Entrepreneur First - a pre-seed investment programme focused on building startups from the ground up. She has helped hundreds of founders start companies before they even have a fixed idea of what they want to build. That core idea is undoubtedly important, but it's not the be-all and end-all. Just ask Slack cofounder Stewart Butterfield, who pivoted Slack away from a multiplayer game twice before he turned it into one of the best enterprise apps in the market. Writing for Techworld, Bentinck says: \"Input from your customers and increased understanding of the problem and market will force you to iterate and change your idea. Ideas are just the starting point, so don't sweat it too hard. The most important thing is to get started.\" Martin Alderson - cofounder of mobile cybersecurity startup Codified Security - says finding the cost of customer acquisition early on is also important. \"Get a grip on SEO, paid search, content marketing and PR - testing the most effective ways of driving customers to you,\" Alderson said. \"We didn't test enough price points or collect enough data, a significant oversight. We needed to ask how much people would pay, not just if they would pay.\" Bentinck wants to debunk the myth that finding a cofounder is like dating, outlining mutual respect as the best foundation to build a startup on: \"Team building is not painting by numbers, but by working seriously on something you care about, with someone you respect, is a pretty good start.\" Matt Robinson cofounded the fintech startup GoCardless alongside Tom Blomfield and current CEO Hiroki Takeuchi, and he says agreeing who is the boss is an important early step. \"This will only get harder with time,\" he says. \"Until we decided who was CEO the underlying uncertainty over who was really in charge affected everything the company did to some extent.\" You don't want a Social Network-style breakup on your hands, so it is important to be up-front with your cofounder(s) to avoid issues further down the line. Get a solid founders agreement down on paper so that everyone knows where they stand. Before you get attached to a name make sure it is available. Tom Blomfield, CEO at Monzo Bank will be able to vouch for this piece of advice after he had to change the name of his digital challenger bank from Mondo following a legal challenge. He even decided to crowdsource new name ideas in a bid to make a positive from a negative situation. Andrew Griffin, CEO of consultancy Oakhall Advisors, has some handy advice for securing your name for the future: \"Check that your preferred domain and company name, and trademark name are available using a domain name registrar, Companies House, and the UK's Intellectual Property Office trademark register respectively.\"  Registering a domain will cost around PS30 and setting up the company with Companies House another PS15. Next \"you will need to give a registered office,\" Griffin says. \"If you don't have one, use your home address, or you can spend PS40-50 with an agency to give you a virtual registered office. You can be a sole director, and to start with give yourself a single share. You can change the share capital later.\" It's important to note that neither registering the domain or company name gives you rights to the brand, \"so spend money with a trademark lawyer to get your name registered for specific business activities. It can avoid huge problems later,\" Griffin warns. This will set you back around PS600-1200 and gives you a six month window to also register overseas. As a startup your intellectual property is your most important asset. Andy Moseby, corporate partner at the technology and digital media law firm Kemp Little advises: \"Before discussing opportunities with suppliers/customers, consider a confidentiality agreement. \"It obliges parties to keep discussions confidential. When you've lined up some prospects, use terms and conditions to govern the sale of your product/service. It sets clear rights and obligations, allocates liability and covers for when things go wrong.\" Digital startups will always want to have control of the data they generate, and will need to stay on the right side of the law when it comes to holding proprietary data. Luckily this is a quick and cheap job: \"By law you have to register your business with the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). This costs PS35 a year and again takes just 10 minutes or so,\" says Griffin. Griffin's first piece of financial advice is a simple one, and will make your life a lot easier: Get an accountant. \"They will perhaps save you money but certainly save you from making mistakes with your corporation tax or VAT. You should be able to get one for around PS1000 a year as a startup,\" he says. Even with a good accountant you will have to do a few things to stay on the right side of the government. \"If you are making money from the start, you will want to register for fixed rate VAT, which means you pay a lower VAT rate on your sales, but cannot claim VAT back on input costs,\" Griffin explains. \"If you are losing money to start with, and especially if you are outsourcing, say, website development, then register for full VAT, and monthly VAT returns, and then you can claim back VAT paid to suppliers each month.\" You will also need to register for corporation tax and, if you employ anyone, PAYE. You can pay your accountant to do this but if you are only a small team the HMRC offers free payroll software that should make things more manageable. Lastly make sure you have some form of liability and employee insurance, and be sure to shop around for a good rate. Most startups will bootstrap their first hundred days. You could get approached with some outside funding options though, so it is good to be prepared. Taking venture capital money can be hugely tempting early on as you look to grow rapidly. David Hickson, head of corporate development at startup accelerator Founders Factory, says if you want to be taken seriously by investors, a well put together slide deck remains the most important piece of kit in your locker. \"Tell the story as a narrative arc through problem, solution, product, size of opportunity, go-to-market and demographic, how it differentiates from the competition, how it create a sustainable competitive advantage against the competition and new entrants, and which informs (and is informed by) the financial plan, the use of raise funds and the unit economics,\" Hickson says.  Of course accepting venture capital this early in the process is risky. It brings new pressures and investor intentions might be quite different to your own. Venture capitalist at Partech Ventures Boris Golden told Techworld: \"Only a very small percentage of companies are suitable [for VC funding]. They need to match two main things: they need to have huge potential - say, to become a unicorn [a company worth over a billion dollars]. The second is they need to have the ambition to do that.\" Matt Robinson is working on his second venture with proptech startup Nested, and he says 100 days isn't enough time to truly get started. \"You need at least one year full-time to get anywhere,\" he says, \"particularly if you're working on something new or groundbreaking. Commit the time to reach an inflection point or don't bother.\"  ",

      "content": "Since the human genome was successfully mapped in 2003, researchers have been making use of technology to organise the growing mountain of genomics data into a form that will eventually benefit actual patients. When he unveiled the Precision Medicine Initiative in 2015, US president Barack Obama recognised the potential that technology and gene mapping can bring to patients. His state of the union address laid out a vision for the groundbreaking initiative: \"Doctors have always recognised that every patient is unique, and doctors have always tried to tailor their treatments as best they can to individuals. You can match a blood transfusion to a blood type - that was an important discovery. What if matching a cancer cure to our genetic code was just as easy, just as standard?\" Now innovative startups across the world are taking on this exact challenge, bringing cutting edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to the genomics space and building tools that give medical professionals the means to deliver personalised medicine through more effective diagnostics and drug discovery. The USA - whether it is thanks to the Obama administration or not - appears to be ahead of the curve when it comes to bioinformatics, the name given to the practice of applying computer technology to the management of biological information. The website AngelList alone shows 152 startups that identify themselves as working in the bioinformatics space, with just 10 residing in the UK and a further 17 across Europe.   Without a precision medicine initiative of its own, European startups have had to go it alone when it comes to collating this biological information. The CEO of leading UK bioinformatics startup BenevolentBio - one half of UK AI startup BenevolentAI - Jackie Hunter told Techworld that since being founded in 2013 a big task for them has been \"to find standardised ways to collate, correlate and annotate that data\". Despite being funded to the tune of PS72 million to date, BeneovolentAI is competing in a world where a big pharmaceutical company like Pfizer can spend nearly $8 billion a year on research and development (R&D). But startups have the edge when it comes to agility and technological expertise.  The existing drug development process can take at least fifteen years, costs upwards of tens of billions of dollars and is high risk, according to Hunter. \"Most people in the pharmaceutical industry work on things that never make it to market or even to man,\" she told the recent artificial intelligence in bioscience symposium at the Royal Society in London.  Improving drug efficacy is Hunter's mission. The idea is to expedite the traditional research process by ingesting huge amounts of data and literature using proprietary algorithms and NVIDIA's DGX-1 deep learning supercomputer.  BenevolentAI then builds tools on top to match the workflow of drug discovery scientists so that they can easily mine and interrogate the data, ideally reducing the time to market for important drugs. Current CEO of BenevolentTech - the technology arm of BenevolentAI - Jerome Pesenti comes from a software background, previously working on IBM's Watson project, and he is bringing a few of those techniques to the drug discovery process.  Pesenti speaks often about building a feedback loop through having both the AI researchers and bioscientists in one place. Controlling the process from end-to-end helps them move faster. \"We can go from the conception of the AI to putting it in the hands of scientists, to getting the drugs, to collecting new data through actual trials in animals and in humans and leveraging new technology to interpret that data.\"  One key advantage of failing fast in drug development is being able to repurpose a compound for a different target disease, rather than giving up.  \"I come from the software world and we talk about fail fast and that's the key there,\" Pesenti said. \"You want to kill a lot of ideas really quickly to get the best one, whereas the dynamic in traditional drug discovery is you're stuck to your compound and you invest a lot and you're rewarded if this one is going to market.\"  Another company making a lot of noise in the data driven medicine space is Sophia Genetics from Switzerland. It already works with a half-dozen UK hospitals to pool data and bring AI-driven insights to cancer diagnostics, claiming to already diagnose hundreds of patients a day. Sophia Genetics' algorithms look for genetic variations, or mutations, that are unique to a patient compared to a reference genome. They annotate these variants as thoroughly as possible to see if a medicine has already been characterised as effective for the case, provide suggested actions for the clinician and automatically classify disorders, so the system gets smarter.  Sophia has its AI firmly focused on cancer. CEO and cofounder Dr. Jurgi Camblong told Techworld: \"Cancer is mutations of our DNA. It tends to propagate in an uncontrolled way, so by using diagnostic sequencing with algorithms we can go deep into the data and eliminate the noise to find the signal. We have a better idea behind the real reason cancer develops and can adopt the right treatment.\" Just this month in London the new Francis Crick Institute opened in Kings Cross. With a budget of PS100 million a year and more than 1,250 scientists it is the biggest biomedical research facility in Europe. One project proposed for the new space comes from David Jones, head of the bioinformatics group at UCL. Jones is embarking on a two year secondment where he will build on his previous success applying machine learning to genome research to not just label the genes but to \"relate genes to disease.\" He admits this is a difficult challenge \"but that isn't a reason not to do it\" and the goal is to reach a point where they can \"infer which genes may well be involved with particular diseases\". Jones will use a training set from Mendelian (inherited) diseases, \"where we know that specific genes when they are disrupted in particular ways create the symptoms of inherited disorders\". If he can successfully generalise this approach the system could be used to perform predictive diagnosis for a whole range of diseases. This all sounds very positive for anyone that doesn't have a vested interest in the big pharmaceutical industry.  However, the lack of due diligence performed across the tech industry recently with the disaster that is still unfolding around Silicon Valley biotech startup Theranos should give us all reason to pause when it comes to combining tech buzzwords with real, medical use cases.  The stakes are really high, both in terms of the money on the line and the breeding of false hope. There is also the risk of gene editing as the next logical step beyond gene mapping, and all of the ethical concerns that come with that particular use case. As BenevolentTech's Jerome Pesenti said: \"It's easy to talk about AI and it's easy to pretend that you're doing something. I think AI is real. The big labs are doing big interesting things, we're doing interesting things, but the key will be in the proof point.\" What we do know is that machines are better equipped to cut through the vast data sets the mapped genome has created than scientists are. The potential to then apply this technology and insight to diagnostics and drug discovery, and actually get it into doctor's hands, is the next unknown. ",

      "content": "Since it acquired the startup platform Heroku in 2010 Salesforce has been growing its ecosystem of innovative companies who are using its suite of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) tools to reach new customers. Over the course of Dreamforce - the CRM vendor's huge annual conference last week - Techworld got a flavour for what Salesforce looks for in a startup and how it is looking to build an ecosystem around its Heroku Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) community and a newly founded incubator. Frenchman Ludo Ulrich is the man charged with developing Salesforce's startup ecosystem. In his own words, Salesforce for Startups is: \"The high scale, global programme, freely available to anyone to discover what Salesforce can bring to that market. Think about us as a platform to build on, and how to give back and include that in the fabric of your company.\" This is separate to the ventures arm of the business. Instead of focusing on strategic investments, Ulrich is charged with giving a community of more than 7,000 startups a platform to build upon and connect them with relevant Salesforce staff and partners. He then gets to cherry pick the best and brightest for their newly founded incubator down in the tech alley that is the South of Market (SoMa) neighbourhood in downtown San Francisco. The incubator had its first demo day earlier this year, with the first cohort themed around the wonderfully nebulous term 'platform'. The next cohort, which will consist of around a dozen startups working for five months from April this year, is targeting companies that are working with, you guessed it, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Salesforce recently announced a raft of artificial intelligence features that have been added to its suite of products called Einstein.  Ulrich is also looking to bring in a more diverse and international cohort than the first, which was 100 percent North American. Applications will open towards the end of the year (follow @salesforcestart to stay up to date). He also refused to rule out the possibility of opening more incubators across different geographies. Unlike Google's DeepMind, Salesforce isn't interested in research organisations. They want the intelligence to be baked into whatever the startup is building. In his fight against buzzwords Ulrich goes as far as to \"challenge the founders to pitch their companies without using the word AI.\"  Ulrich said that the type of startups he targets align with what Salesforce customers are asking for, and that \"going to market now without any level of intelligence would be unexpected to say the least\". It seems that Salesforce isn't done with their recent AI spending spree, and wants to continue to bring talent into the organisation. As the head of the Einstein project John Ball said during his Dreamforce keynote: \"This is just the start of what Einstein can do.\" When it comes to investments, Salesforce Ventures is looking strictly for cloud enterprise software startups to \"fit the gaps that our customers are identifying\", Ulrich says. In other words: AI, IoT, ecommerce and analytics would be smart focus areas for startups looking to get into the Salesforce ecosystem. Ulrich's old employer Microsoft set up a rival ventures arm back in May. Its first portfolio of investments also stretches across enterprise software, with focus areas around SaaS, cloud infrastructure, security, productivity, analytics and machine learning. Ulrich is a realist with a venture capitalist mentality. He's aware that not all startups will be a home run: \"If there is a company that doesn't have the calibre to be a VC backed company, but we can build a decent business selling to Salesforce companies on the App Exchange, then that is also success for us.\" Both CEO Marc Benioff and COO Keith Block went into detail on what Salesforce looks for in acquisition targets during this year's Dreamforce conference. It's safe to consider these expectations as the macro picture to what Ulrich is doing on a more micro level within Salesforce.  During his questions and answer session with investors last week Benioff responded to the rumours that the company is preparing a bid for the social network Twitter by stating: \"Number one is we look at a lot of companies, we look at a lot of things and pass on almost everything. \"I think our history and track record is better than anyone, not every deal has been perfect, but the vast majority of cases we either got great people, great technology or a great business and in best cases we get all three.\"  Similarly, because Salesforce executives are nothing if they aren't polished with their messaging, COO Keith Block told a Dreamforce press conference: \"We look at a roster of companies and Marc and I have a steady dialogue about these things. We look at culture: will it be a cultural fit? Is it a good product fit? Is it amazing technology? Is there value? What are the risks in assimilating that company into ours?\" Benioff also wanted to be clear that he doesn't value acquisition targets based on their proprietary data, an accusation that has been levelled at all the LinkedIn suitors. He said: \"We liked that asset [LinkedIn] because of its deferred revenue. I wasn't valuing that asset based on the data.\" ",

      "content": "Running out of battery on-the-go has happened to all of us and I'm sure we're of the same opinion. It's annoying. So, when Chargifi CEO Dan Bladen and his wife jetted off to South America for six months, naturally, they found themselves making very strategic decisions about the places they visited, based on the availability of power sockets. \"We would peek in through the front of coffee shops, restaurants, and look for power plugs, and then made a decision about where we ate that night, or had coffee based on that,\" said Bladen. \"It got me thinking, if we'd been traveling a few years earlier, we would have gone in looking to see if that location had Wi-Fi. In 2012, that was back when we were traveling, Wi-Fi was much, much more ubiquitous.\" \"Our problem moved from lack of connectivity to the need for the provision of power. It's something that you don't really need to go traveling around the world for a few months just to experience it, something that we probably are concerned with every day, where is our next charge coming from?,\" he added. The Chargifi concept is simple. They supply wireless charging software or hardware (or both) to businesses. Businesses can log into the Chargifi dashboard to measure customer usage and even control the hours wireless charging is available. Then, Chargifi customers can place Chargifi wireless charging 'keys' around the venue for customers to plug into their phones. All they have to do is download the app and connect their device to beging charging. Alternatively, if their phone has wireless capabilities built-in, they can just download the app and begin charging, without connecting to a Chargifi 'key'. The Chargifi app will tell consumers where their nearest charging spot is, whether that's a cafe, restaurant or bookshop.   \"We provide venues with a system that gets installed to make wireless charging available to their customers,\" explained Bladen. \"We charge the venue on a monthly basis for the provision of this, the same way that a venue might have a relationship with the cloud or BTOP to provide Wi-Fi for that venue. We do the same, but with wireless power,\" he added.  Wireless charging hardware is nothing new. Companies like Powermat supply some of the largest coffee chains in the country with wireless charging docks. Interestingly, Chargifi also supports this hardware and can provide its wireless charging software for businesses currently using Powermat or other wireless charging hardware brands.  \"Our focus is really on the software that manages all this wireless charging tech that's already become mainstream. Our software can sit on top of Powermat hardware and can control their hardware,\" explained Bladen. \"We also bring our convenient hardware that we don't manufacture ourselves, but we have vetted from a user experience point of view. The real key different between how you would experience Chargifi in a venue compared to experiencing Powermat in a venue is the transmitters that we'd like to use are installed underneath the surface. They create a large wireless charging zone on top of the surface,\" he added. It's well known that coffee shops make most of their money before 10am, leaving businesses struggling to fill seats and coffee cups later in the day. Currently in use at the Duke of York's office at Buckingham Palace, University of Greenwich and Imperial College London, Chargifi aims to get more people into UK businesses, to spend more money.  \"Some venues, don't want to increase their [customer] dwell time, they just want to attract customers to coffee shops at different times of day,\" said Bladen. \"Our management software allows them to choose how long Chargifi sessions last at different times of day, so they can management everything.,\" he added. It's pretty reasonable to assume that wireless charging will get people through the door of UK businesses, but the way the analytics are used by those businesses will determine whether we can expect a mass uptake from UK customer-facing businesses.  \"One of the great stats that we've been given is that if you can increase dwell time in every kind of environment by 1 percent, you actually increase spend by 1.6 percent,\" said Bladen. \"Our future plans are to continue to support wireless charging as it goes from phone to tablet to laptops and other large devices. We're going down an API route, so we are providing our API for a brand to build Chargifi into their app as well, rather than people coming to the Chargifi app,\" concluded Bladen. ",

      "content": "London fintech startup DueDil has let go of around ten percent of its workforce in a round of redundancies, after a yet-to-be-announced funding round. The startup provides an online platform for businesses to do due diligence on other companies. Talking to Techworld CEO Damian Kimmelman explained the decision: \"It's never a nice thing to have to do but I want to build a business that can weather anything and part of that is having to really focus on things that are core to that mission and not things that are auxiliary.\" Kimmelman stated that it is his aim to become a profitable business and not to rely on external funding. Following the redundancies he stated his aim is \"to get to profitability and the way we do that is by optimising our cost per customer acquisition.\"  The five-year-old startup announced record sales earlier this year, with a press release stating: \"In Q2 2016, DueDil enterprise sales were up 118 percent year-on-year. New customers in the quarter include PayPal, Securitas Ireland, Netjets and Currencies Direct.\" The startup has been funded to the tune of $22 million (PS17 million) to date from investors including Oak Investment Partners and Passion Capital, with the last reported round of $17 million in March 2014. DueDil had employed around 100 people at its office near Finsbury Square, in between The City and Silicon Roundabout. The redundancies came across departments and included a communications manager who had been at the company since June 2015.  Kimmelman suggested that it is better to be too lean than too bloated as a business at this point in its lifecycle. \"If you are too lean you can hire more\" he said. \"But if you don't pre-empt then you don't have many options in the future and it is my fiduciary responsibility to make hard decisions like this to focus on being a strong businesses.\" The startup still plans to expand into Europe despite the recent redundancies. Kimmelman said: \"We get to profitability by opening up new markets.\" The startup stated in a press release back in July that \"DueDil is also evaluating plans to develop an international presence outside of the UK - potentially through opening offices elsewhere in Europe. It will still continue to scale its presence in London and hire staff in the UK.\" DueDil still has three open job listings up on its site for the London office in sales, marketing and business development roles.

      "content": "The former founder of London fintech startup GoCardless has a new property tech (proptech) startup which promises to help homeowners to sell their property in 90 days, or they will give you the money to make your next purchase interest-free. Matt Robinson has been working on Nested since November. The site has been up for a few months now and Robinson says they have been getting one or two leads a week already, \"which sounds pitiful\" he admits, \"but our average lead is PS20,000, so if people can find me a startup that has more than PS100,000 a month revenue coming in before they have launched I would love to hear about it, because that is not how it was at GoCardless\". Robinson founded GoCardless in 2011 alongside Monzo bank founder and CEO Tom Blomfield and current GoCardless CEO Hiroki Takeuchi in 2011. Robinson remains on the board at GoCardless. Robinson brought onboard former Songkick CTO and Cambridge computer science and machine learning PhD Phil Cowans to build the proprietary valuation algorithms he needed at Nested. Using the algorithms Cowans has built Nested provides sellers with a property valuation within seconds and guarantees a minimum price from day one, promising to sell the house within 90 days or give them the money. Nested will review the quick valuation and organise an inspection before confirming a guaranteed offer price and placing adverts on property portals like Zoopla and Rightmove. They even take care of the viewings.  One method they use is a repeat sale regression, or forward index price, which is basically the price a property sold for recently and inflated to today's prices on a pound per square foot basis, which Robinson says is the best way to value property. Another method Nested use is the comparable method where they take similar properties nearby to estimate how much it will sell for. Robinson says this is broadly similar to how an estate agent would value your property, except algorithmically, meaning it is instant and fairly transparent. How does Nested prove that their valuation is fair? Firstly Robinson expects homeowners to get a second opinion from estate agents. Secondly, if you search for a property on Nested you will see the recent sale price of neighbouring properties, if that information is available. Nested does this by splicing together a number of data sources that Robinson wouldn't be pushed on, but probably includes publicly available data from the Land Registry. In exchange for this guarantee Nested charges a minimum fee of 1.8 percent once you close a sale. Nested will then take another twenty percent of any money that is made on the sale above the algorithmically decided value. Nested is currently available as a web service in London for houses worth less than one million pounds. Robinson came up with Nested after he noticed that cash buyers have an unfair advantage in the UK property market. He explained: \"I was going through the process of buying a house myself and as a cash buyer every agent I spoke to said I could pay less than anyone else and dictate terms. This is because you are a more attractive buyer as there is less chance of the deal falling through.\" The reason many house deals fall through in the UK is because sales are often reliant on other people selling their property first. If a buyer or seller in the property chain pulls out it causes a domino effect that leaves other people in the chain stranded. Robinson said in a press release: \"The whole property chain and selling process is broken, with sellers complaining about slow lawyers, endless phones calls, untrustworthy estate agents, and of course, being let down by the buyer at the last minute. \"The trick for me was to give people certainty from day one,\" Robinson says. \"If we sell it within 90 days great, if not we give them the money ourselves. So from day one you can act like you have the money, like a cash buyer. That puts you at the top of the queue to get your dream home.\" The business proposition looks risky, especially if market forces outside of Nested's control change drastically. Over email Robinson told Techworld: \"We don't buy the property, we give it to them as an interest-free loan which we secure against the property.\" To mitigate this risk \"we only ever guarantee as much property as we could theoretically buy in full if we needed to\", Robinson said. \"So our PS3 million allows us to guarantee that much property (e.g. 5 x PS600k properties) at any given time and obviously recycle this cash as soon as each of those is sold.\" In order to scale Nested will have to raise a huge amount more than its PS3 million seed round led by Passion Capital, who also invested in GoCardless. Robinson said: \"Clearly the next step is to raise PS25 million to run the model at initial scale, and as soon as possible after that to raise in the hundreds of millions to ramp this to true scale.\" Robinson has compared Nested to the US company Opendoor, which has raised $110 million according to Crunchbase. He told Business Insider that one of the initial investors is the Samwer brothers who \"are billionaires and they want to pour as much money as possible into this so we can raise money very, very quickly\".

      "content": "DeepMind has begun a public consultation with patients and healthcare workers to receive feedback on plans to introduce its artificial intelligence technology to the National Health Service (NHS). DeepMind - a London-based startup acquired by Google in 2014 - specialises in the creation of deep learning algorithms, and was responsible for the the AlphaGo programme which beat Go world champion Lee Sedol earlier this year.   It has also turned its attention to applying its technology to help modernise the ailing health service by digitising processes and making better use of data. \"This is a new space for us, and we have set out to involve as many people as possible in our design process from the outset,\" said Mustafa Suleyman, DeepMind co-founder, at a public forum event at the company's London offices on Tuesday.  DeepMind Health's initial projects have included a partnership with Moorfields Eye Hospital to apply its algorithms to the diagnosis of common eye diseases, and with the Royal Free Hospital to develop an app that improves the detection of acute kidney injuries. However, while its initial endeavours have attracted interest against a backdrop of an under-funded NHS, it has also drawn criticisms over plans to use confidential patient data that is necessary to train its algorithms. This has included an investigation by the Information Commissioner's Officer around data encryption procedures following a public complaint about the company being given access to 1.6 million patient records at the Royal Free. Addressing audience comments, Suleyman promised that one of its core philosophies would be 'do no harm' as it seeks to allay concerns around data governance, privacy and the corporate interests of parent company Alphabet. \"This has to be a mantra that we repeat and becomes an inherent part of our process and should be the first measure of success before any deployment, or before we attempt to demonstrate any utility and patient benefit,\" he said. Suleyman added that openness and transparency would be key to winning over those who are sceptical of DeepMind's plans. He promised to continue to publish the results of its work, both its algorithms and \"clinical peer-reviewed evaluations of the measurable impact we have had\". While the specifics of its long term commercial aims and business model were less clear, Suleyman indicated this would be results-based, reflecting the success of projects. \"Of course that is important, we have to build a sustainable business model around this,\" he said. \"We have been clear about this from the outset. \"What we have avoided doing is nailing that down too early and luckily we have the resources to explore what the most effective business model would be around our intervention, so that essentially we get paid when we deliver value.\" He added: \"What we would like to do is for at least some proportion of what we get paid to be connected to the actual concrete outcomes. That is another way in which patients can play an active role in helping us to identify what the important metrics are to patients, as well as the hospital in terms of its efficiency. That is going to be a really challenging aspect of the model.\" DeepMind is not offering a silver bullet for the problems of the NHS however. Suleyman acknowledged that its projects remain at very early stages. One example cited was a patient portal smartphone app which would allow those receiving treatment to access appointment information and other data as well as potentially interacting with clinical staff remotely. It is an exciting prospect, yet Suleyman stressed that this is just a concept at this stage, and is \"months if not years away\" from actually being built. He also recognises that ageing hospital systems will present a bottleneck to development, with DeepMind's technology still reliant on integration with legacy backend software. He said: \"That is a challenge for us because we obviously have to interact with those systems and even if information moves into our ecosystem and we can be absolutely confident that this is entirely secure and transparent and auditable and verifiable and so on, we are still interfacing with a system that is many years behind the cutting-edge with respect to information security processing.\"  He added that a lot of the technical systems that store and process data were \"genuinely developed for completely other sectors, not even healthcare\". \"It is pretty remarkable when you look at it,\" he said. \"There have been clinical systems today used to run entire hospitals which at their heart were originally designed for logistics systems or accounting systems or for manufacturing and have been adapted first to a US context and subsequently to the UK and NHS.  \"That means we are dealing with quite old and quite brittle technologies that really haven't been subjected to improvement for a long time.\" According to Suleyman, reliance on ageing infrastructure has throttled previous attempts to create digital services in healthcare. \"Frankly speaking that is why there hasn't been a great deal of innovation in the sector. There are all sorts of startups who have incredible ideas and would love to deploy these sorts of solutions and I think the main obstacle they have been facing is the barriers to entry that some of the existing larger players have put around access to data.\" DeepMind will not be immune to these challenges either, though Suleyman is confident that industry collaboration will help. \"We are going to face those issues too but I think we are maybe in a slightly stronger position to try and develop a more open innovation ecosystem around this data, obviously controlled by the data controller, the trust and by the patient.\"  Clearly DeepMind is under no illusion of the scale of the challenge it faces, both from a technical point of view and in terms of wider public and regulatory perspectives. But there is no doubt that its technology offers intriguing possibilities for improving healthcare in the UK. The next steps for DeepMind Health will be to continue consulting with staff and patients as often as possible, with a patient involvement strategy document to be published in January 2017. \"This is really just the beginning,\" Suleyman concluded. \"There will be many, many more forums where we can take your critical feedback and show you how we have improved and updated in the months in between these kinds of sessions.\" ",

      "content": "There aren't many startups with the bravery (or foolishness?) to list Google as a competitor. But Bristol-based Yellow Dog has no such qualms. \"We've replaced Google among some of our customers,\" says founder and MD Gareth Williams.  The pitch is simple enough: Yellow Dog is a crowd-sourced cloud computing provider. \"There is enough computer power in the world already. It just isn't being distributed properly,\" Williams explained during an Oracle OpenWorld 2016 panel. Businesses use their servers up to just 15 percent of their potential capacity, on average, so there is a staggering amount of computing power around the world going spare. Yellow Dog's plan is to pay companies for this spare computing capacity and then sell this to organisations which require vast amounts of power for processes such as rendering CGI adverts, TV cartoons, architectural plans and so on. \"These animations often have about 25 frames per second, and last for two and a half minutes. They can take 10 hours to render and require a vast amount of computer power,\" Williams said. By providing customers with access to, for example, 300 servers simultaneously, Yellow Dog can cut this time down from 10 hours to just 15 minutes, he added. Partners can provide Yellow Dog with their spare capacity by installing Yellow Dog's application on their servers. If utilisation drops below a certain threshold, their spare computing power becomes available for reuse. Yellow Dog's main competitors include Rebus Farm and Zync Render, a company Google acquired in 2014, Williams said. Despite being launched commercially just under a year ago and employing just five staff, Yellow Dog already has 350 customers including in Australia, Canada and the west coast of the US and plans to open a North America office next year. Sadly, Williams refuses to reveal who any of these customers are. He merely says they include production firms who make children's TV shows for the BBC and others, plus architectural firms and advertisers, although he says they hope to be able to name names 'soon'. Question marks do remain, despite Yellow Dog's evidently high potential. For a company that is supposed to be about crowdsourcing, it is very surprising to hear they have only one partner signed up to provide power: a managed service provider based in the south west of the UK. Williams says they are \"in conversation\" with another data centre company but it is still remarkable they don't have more partners signed up already. The rest of its computing power is bought from Oracle, AWS and OVH, effectively making Yellow Dog a reseller for the time being. However it is still very early days, so perhaps it's inevitable they'll need to supplement their computing sources until they can bring more providers on board. Yellow Dog successfully managed to crowdfund PS150,000 last year within two weeks, so there is clearly an appetite for what they're selling. They've raised PS580,000 in total so far, largely through (undisclosed) Angel Investors, and expect to become profitable within the next year. As with a lot of UK startups, especially those based beyond London, one of the biggest challenges is access to funding and skills, Williams admitted. But would they consider moving the headquarters? \"We might open offices elsewhere. But we'll always be in Bristol,\" he promised. ",

      "content": "Looked at from China, the Isle of Man must appear to be a tiny sea-bound speck on the fringe of Europe, assuming they've even heard of it. Now, all of a sudden, it looks as if little and large have spotted a common interest, with the IoM Government last month signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that will open a small but important corridor from the island to Chinese tech zone, the Zhongguancun Boya Multimedia Creative and Innovation Park (ZBMCIP) near Beijing.  It's always hard to judge the significance of this these paper deals in advance of tangibles, but as previously noted in Techworld, the IoM has a policy of actively encouraging technology startups and wants new Chinese firms of any ilk to consider the island as a possible base for expansion in the west. So far only larger established Chinese firms such as Huawei have made this kind of jump to Europe, although this must change at some point. Looked at another way, the island desperately wants to shed its former image as a tax haven and tech is its escape pod. The Chinese for their part seem to be intrigued by the island's status as a Crown dependency, connected to bother the UK and Ireland but independent of both. The IoM is not a member of the EU but is inside its VAT zone which allows the free movement of goods. \"The Isle of Man identified China a place it should hook up with,\" agrees the Isle of Man's director of e-business development, Jonathan Mills. \"It seems like the elephant and the mouse but the Isle of Man has offices in China and the logic is to put ourselves as a good place to base yourself for world business.\" Under the MoU, the ZBMCIP will promote the island in China as a base for companies looking to expand into Europe and assist joint ventures looking to move in the other direction. \"The major benefit today is that if you are a manufacturer in China and you want to distribute throughout Europe, because we are in a VAT zone you can direct ship.\" Offshore from a Britain preoccupied with the tedious detail of Brexit, the Isle of Man carries on as normal, essentially unaffected. \"The IoM did an assessment of Brexit a couple of months ago and it wasn't pinning its colour to one side or the other,\" says Mills. But should Brexit come to pass as the radical separation some of its most ardent supporters hope, the UK could do worse than study the example set by the tiny island in forging links with China at a time when the deatil of the country's new trading relationships with the world remain poorly described. The Chinese startup and SMB sector will come out of its shell one day and will need partners but it is the tiny island state not giant UK Plc that has made a start in attracting its enterprising firms.

      "content": "When ARPANET engineer Ray Tomlinson sent the world's first email message in 1971 he decided to make it easy for himself. The message was sent from himself to himself from a computer sitting on a desk inches away from the recipient system.  Nearly half a century on, this simple idea of sending messages from one person to another has turned from a straightforward technical challenge into an organisational, legal and occasionally (just ask Hillary Clinton) political minefield. Every email user in the world has at some point accidentally sent a message to the wrong person or, on the other side, received a misdirected one out of the blue. For years this was just an annoying mishap and then data protection laws started to bite and the issue turned darker. Various solutions have been suggested, most simply by introducing a proprietary 'undo send' delay before an email is sent from a particular platform. If the sender notices the misdirection, the email can be stopped. Except that most people don't notice. Undo send also reduces the responsiveness of email because it means that even correctly addressed messages are delayed. Encryption is another method but that introduces considerable complexity and expense and to business managers sounds like technological overkill. The problem remains intractable enough that it has aroused the interest of a new British startup, CheckRecipient. As with Hook, an anti-phishing training startup recently profiled in Techworld, CheckRecipient is currently ensconced in Cyber London (CyLon), a dedicated UK cybersecurity accelerator that seems to be cranking out a line of interesting cybersecurity firms. As with Hook, CheckRecipient is about fixing an old problem that a lot of larger tech firms seem to have either given up on or can't figure out how to make pay.   The system works as a layer between a user and the people they send emails to, learning from their patterns of usage. From this, it can predict whether an email is being sent to the wrong person. Most employees send certain kinds of emails to only a very select group of people so using machine learning intelligence to manage this process in a reliable way sounds logical. As CheckRecipient CEO and cofounder Tim Sadler explains below, the system has attracted interest within sectors that are traditionally highly-sensitive to confidentiality such as the legal profession and financial services. It sounds odd to think of confidentiality as if it is something that only a niche group of organisations would worry about. This was probably true in the 1990s when stories of mis-directed emails started to attract attention as email took off, but it sounds pretty complacent two decades on. We live in a world that is slowly starting to grasp the often hidden, slow-motion effects of confidential data misdirected through simple human error. The information inside emails is still data after all.  What is incredible is that organisations are still grappling with this issue at all but the team at CheckRecipient aren't complaining.   Tim Sadler, on founding CheckRecipient: After studying engineering, I began a career in investment banking. I was astounded that despite  this highly regulated industry being full of protocol and policy, it was still possible to lose sensitive information through simple human error. Everyone knows that sinking feeling when an email is sent to the wrong person, but in industries like finance or healthcare which involve the processing of highly sensitive personal information as standard, a simple human mistake can have enormous consequences. A Freedom of Information (FOI) request earlier this year, found that human error accounted for almost two-thirds (62 percent) of the incidents reported between 2014-2016 and of this, 9 percent of cases were as the result of data accidentally emailed to the wrong person. Even so, there wasn't any software solution to this problem, so along with a group of university friends, I spotted a gap in the market and CheckRecipient was born. Very simply, our product is designed to prevent emails being sent to the wrong people due to inadvertent human error. We use artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyse historical email data, and then predict when an email is being addressed or sent to the wrong person. If you're a lawyer for example, and you're sending information to the wrong client, the system would draw on historical data - keywords or phrases used in emails to certain recipients - alerting you to the mistake before the email is sent. By analysing this historical data, CheckRecipient understands the conventional sending patterns and behaviour within the organisation and then detects any anomalies. Although sending the wrong email or document out by mistake might not result in a regulatory fine, there may be other reputational or financial repercussions both to you as an individual and to your organisation, which can be damaging in their own right. When setting up a new business, the idea is just the first step; turning it into a commercial business through execution is the hard part. Luckily, the technical skills we'd gained from university meant that we were able to build the product without needing to get external support. But understanding the cybersecurity industry - who the buyers were and their pain points - was much more complex. It's all very well building a functional product, but you have to make sure it's needed and that it fits in with your audience's behaviours and habits. Our original MVP ('minimum viable product') required a lot of admin. We thought companies wouldn't mind administration if it made their data safer. But companies are reluctant to implement cybersecurity measures if they also place a burden on employees in the firm. They're not willing to compromise if it involves an employee having to spend a number of hours per week dedicated to it. Sussing that out was challenging but we learnt our lesson by going to market with our products as soon as possible and then engaging with stakeholders to gather direct feedback early on. A year ago we joined cybersecurity accelerator programme, Cyber London (CyLon), and the advice and support we've gained has been invaluable. But this kind of specialist guidance is relatively new in the UK market and for a highly skilled subject like cybersecurity, it is essential. Although the UK is still slightly behind the likes of the US and Israel when it comes to supporting cyber innovation, things are starting to change with drastic improvement in the last year alone. Programmes like HutZero, a dedicated cybersecurity bootcamp aimed at helping people turn their ideas into startups, are testament to this. So far, our product has been well-received and we've secured customers including some of the world's largest law firms, hedge funds and investment banking advisory firms. We're already finding that CISOs and CIOs are far more willing to embrace new technology than when we first started. I left university in 2011 and the general trend graduates only wanting to work for large companies has changed. Young people are attuned to what's involved in working for a startup. Cybersecurity is still quite niche and there's more to be done to educate people about the opportunities it offers. It's often the simplest solution to a problem that turns out to be the best and most elegant. As our story demonstrates, it's the problems right in front of you that are sometimes the most pressing, but they can be missed all the same. ",

      "content": "London startup Trussle has come a long way in the last year. Founded in 2015 by Ishaan Malhi, a former real estate and structured finance analyst at Bank Of America Merrill Lynch, and Jonathan Galore, an experienced fintech entrepreneur, the online mortgage advisor is regulated by the FCA and already claims to manage nearly PS500 million of mortgages. So, how did they get there? The incumbent model of getting a mortgage involves either going to your bank and being locked into their offers, doing your own shopping around, which can be extremely time consuming and involves reams of paperwork, or using a high street broker. Brand and content manager at Trussle Oli West says these \"big guns\" brokers take up \"70 percent of all mortgage deal flow\" and are incentivised to make sales. \"It is largely a numbers game and they have shareholders to satisfy,\" he says. \"There is lots of paperwork, calls after hours, working to their schedule not yours. The average advisor can process ten applications per month.\" Naturally, West says Trussle does things differently. \"It's online, so 24/7 accessible and generally faster, so what can take up to an hour to get a quote takes three minutes,\" he says.  If a customer does still want to speak to someone - after all, it is a pretty big decision - Trussle has advisers on the end of the phone. \"Our processes are automated and that frees up our advisers from admin to be on-hand from a customer need perspective,\" West says, adding that the small team of advisers can handle 100 customer applications per month. What's more, this automation means advisers are less likely to recommend unsuitable products, leading to less rejections. Malhi told Mortgage Solutions back in April: \"So the adviser considers affordability, eligibility and suitability. That's what advice is, a function of those three components. We know which lenders will lend to you, we know how much lenders will lend to you and the suitability is our algorithm mixed with what the adviser's doing.\"  Trussle is still an intermediary, it doesn't sell mortgages. \"We aren't a lender, we're an adviser or broker, so the banks still grant the mortgage, but we do the heavy lifting,\" says West. The startup simply takes a 0.35 percent procurement fee from the lender, on average, after approval. Trussle was able to get approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in just three months. Trussle aggregates mortgage products via an API feed provided by a specialist company, and works with the Mortgage Advice Bureau (MAB), giving it access to roughly 11,000 deals from 90 lenders in the UK market. Companies like Zillow provide APIs for mortgage rates in the USA, and data.gov has several open mortgage data feeds. Trussle is building its own API so that other companies can integrate its mortgage services and feeds within their applications. This is significant as the UK government looks to open up banking in the UK, paving the way for a world where banking is a platform. In practice this means customers would be able to have all their finances manageable within one app, whether that's their current account or mortgage, and with multiple providers. UK challenger banks like Mondo and Atom have already talked about wanting to integrate third parties into their banking applications, such as Nutmeg for investments and, in theory, Trussle for mortgages. Established estate agents and property portals, like strategic partner Zoopla, could also effectively outsource the mortgage process to Trussle via an embedded API on their site. One of the major consumer problems with mortgages is transparency, and West says customers are missing out on huge savings every year simply because they don't know about the alternatives. \"We did a survey a few months ago that showed 60 percent of mortgage owners haven't remortgaged because they find the process overwhelming, but on average they are losing PS2,800 a year stuck on a standard variable rate where they could have remortgaged onto another fixed rate,\" he says.  Trussle's solution is a unique mortgage tracking service, built on the aforementioned API, which will automatically compare a customer's existing mortgage with alternatives in the market on the backend. \"So if new deals come, in our technology figures out that it would make sense to switch and we ping you an email,\" West explains. Trussle takes a very transparent startup approach to its tech stack, to the point that it posts the whole thing online. It is a cloud-based platform, with everything hosted on Amazon Web Services public cloud, and Trussle has even developed some proprietary internal tools to help its mortgage advisers work better. Trussle has been backed to the tune of PS1 million by angel investors LocalGlobe and West's former employer Seedcamp. Property search giant Zoopla announced a strategic partnership with Trussle in February. ",

      "content": "3D printing or 'additive manufacturing', a process used to create 3D objects by building up layers of material formed under computer control, can trace its roots as far back as the 1980s. However it is in the last five years that it has really started to gain traction, with a number of experts suggesting it heralds the beginning of a third industrial revolution that will eventually replace production line assembly.  Objects from cars and houses to prosthetic limbs, jewellery, pizzas and even living cells have been 3D printed, with some of them now at least partially 3D printed as standard.  The UK has played no small part in the development of 3D printing, thanks to academics at Oxford and Glasgow universities, to name just two, plus a whole raft of startups that aim to push the sector forward. Here are a few of the most notable companies from across the UK. What: 'The world leading reseller of best-in-class 3D printers', its shop in Clerkenwell is 'the world's largest 3D printing store'.

      "content": "What convinces two young professionals to leave their comfortable jobs in the energy sector? Back in April 2015 Hayden Wood left his job as a utilities and alternative energy consultant at Bain & Company to \"do something entrepreneurial\", and gas and electricity trader at Barclays, Amit Gudka, followed suit. \"I guess you'd say we both discovered a few things about the energy industry that we realised were massive opportunities for improvement,\" Wood told Techworld.com, sat amongst the potted trees at London's Second Home co-working space, just off Brick Lane. What they saw from within the industry was the chance to use new technology to simplify back-end systems, from the way the utilities companies communicate with customers to the trading process (Amit's area of expertise). Then, there was the lightbulb moment. Last year Hayden and Amit noticed that renewable energy wasn't as premium a product as people might have thought. The Bulb guys saw a huge disconnect between demand for renewable energy and homes that actually switched. They commissioned a YouGov survey of more than 2,000 people in May 2016 and found \"around three quarters of people say they want to switch to renewable, but today only one percent of homes have chosen to be supplied by a hundred percent renewable supplier. There was a demand for this, especially amongst younger people\", Wood says. \"So there's this myth that renewable is inefficient and a lot more expensive, whereas actually, in the wholesale market, renewable is extremely cost-effective,\" Wood says. \"I can't imagine starting an energy company today and it not being renewable.\" So Bulb promises that for every unit of electricity you use, they will produce and place a unit of renewable energy on the grid, from wind, hydro and solar sources across the UK. Bulb doesn't promise to be the cheapest energy provider in the market, but it is aiming to prove that renewable energy doesn't need to be a premium product in the UK. The first thing you will see on the Bulb website is a simple form - not a kilowatt hour in sight - which will tell you how much you can save by switching. For example, I should be saving PS296 a year in a flat in south east London. Surely there is a risk of demand outstripping supply when it comes to renewable energy in the UK though? \"A lot of people ask that question. The short answer is no, there isn't,\" says Wood. Wood believes in the government enough to think that if companies like Bulb - and rivals like Ecotricity and Good Energy - can drive up demand, then renewable supply will follow suit. \"There's already sufficient renewable energy to provide the demand today,\" he says. \"However the problem that we see is that, in the future, the demand for that needs to come from the consumer not from subsidies [...] It's simple supply-and-demand. There'll be demand for renewable energy and as a result, more generation will be built.\" The main challenge Bulb faces is the same as challenger banks are facing, namely: convincing customers that switching their account is simple and worthwhile. \"There is a huge inertia in the market. Only ten percent of people switch a year,\" Wood says. To mitigate this inertia Bulb looks to focus on good customer service, promising to answer customer calls within eight seconds, and by keeping their score with online review sites like TrustPilot hovering around the five-star mark. On top of that, Bulb is now offering to do the switch for you and pay any exit fees. All potential customers have to do is send a picture of a recent bill. Another challenge for a startup like Bulb, working in a highly regulated environment, is remaining transparent and customer friendly while ticking all of the required boxes. For example, while Bulb naturally sends a regulatory compliant bill to all customers, it accompanies this with a transparent breakdown that customers can actually understand. \"Our aim is for our customers never to need to open their statement,\" Wood says. The next big initiative for Bulb is to roll out smart meters to all customers, with the startup currently halfway through a trial period.  Smart meters will help Bulb be even smarter with customer data, and give consumers more detailed consumption information, rather than estimates. Wood explains: \"Every day we'll receive 48 meter readings from a home, as opposed to, at the moment, we'll take maybe a meter reading once a month.\" The tech strategy at Bulb was a fairly tried and tested one from two non-technical founders: \"We focused on user stories, user experience and talked about the problems that we would want to solve. Then we went out and found a series of awesome partners who help us bring that about,\" Wood says. Despite not building the technology themselves Bulb is looking to hire in-house engineers now, as it plans to scale. This in-house team will be focusing on two key areas: automation of operations - so giving energy partners and customers better self-service capabilities - and then the unlocking of that all-important smart meter data. The aim here is simple: \"It's going to become much more data-driven. It means that people can then understand how their behaviour influences their usage, which directly feeds into their energy costs,\" Wood says. I have been conditioned to believe that if something seems too good to be true there must be a catch, but from the outside there doesn't seem to be one with Bulb. Customers save time, money and the planet. The challenge for Bulb, despite their comments to the contrary, will be with scale. If their appealing proposition was to truly take off with customers will they be able to scale sufficiently out of their shared working space and maintain its promise of affordable, one hundred percent renewable energy? We will have to wait and see, but from here it looks like the future is bright for Bulb. ",

      "content": "The internet of things is beginning to provide practical results as it evolves along three paths: machine to machine communications, smart systems, and home automation systems. With the rising running costs of standard PCs, single-board computers have become a popular choice for startups wanting to solve their IT problems on the cheap, not to mention the imaginations of IT pros and hobbyists alike, kindled by the availability of cheap boards and sensors. While not every idea sparked by these components and computing devices will fall under the heading of IoT, scratching the itch to tinker will lead to deeper insights into what may come. Following are several board options for hobbyists, developers, and IT pros to consider for their next invention.  Launched in 2005, the open source Arduino board has inspired a long list of interesting creations. One to note is Enough Already, an Arduino-based project that processes TV signals, muting the TV whenever an overexposed celebrity is being talked about, created back in 2011.  As opposed to Raspberry Pi, which is a small (primarily) Linux-based computer, Arduino offers an integrated platform with any hardware, software and development environment, with processors ranging from 8-bit AVR to 32-bit ARM processors. There are multiple models that sell for about PS20. Like the Raspberry Pi, the Banana Pi offers a range of small single-board computers. And while the Banana Pi is compatible with Raspberry Pi, this open source board can also integrate run NetBSD, Android, Ubuntu and Debian (to name a few).  A standard Banana Pi are built with ARM Cortex-A7 Dual-core CPU and Mali400MP2 GPU, making this single-board computer an ideal host for many different types of applications, and with Wi-Fi module capabilities, the Banana Pi can run as a private data storage server (and much more). Banana Pi prices vary, but you can buy one for PS30 - PS90 depending on specification. This PS50 board runs an AM335x 1GHz ARM processor and can boot Linux in 10 seconds. The BeagleBone Black can run Debian, Android and Ubuntu with users able to create home security systems, robotics, 3D printers, and scanners applications. The target users for BeagleBone Black are developers and hobbyists looking to add actuators and physical sensors for capabilities like touch and temperature with support also extending to USB, Ethernet, and HDMI modules. Certified as an Arduino open source development board, the Intel Galileo Gen 2 is based on Intel Quark SoC X1000 application processor, a 32-bit, single-core processor. This single-board PC is generally geared toward developers, educators, and DIY enthusiasts, with a retail price of around PS60. It can be programmed using the Arduino IDE via Mac OS, Windows, or Linux. While the Galileo Gen 2 itself runs Linux. Intel's NUC, or Next Unit of Computing, comes in a 4-by-4-inch form factor and is positioned by Intel as a higher-performing compact PC alternative to Raspberry Pi. The NUC has found uses in home cinemas, digital signage, and kiosks, and it has served as a gateway to the internet of things, according to Intel anyway. This single-board PC costs around PS200 to PS300 plus memory and storage, is powered by Intel Core processors, and runs Windows, Linux, Android and Chrome OS. It's a big step up in price, compared to others listed, so is most suited to an experienced developer. The pcDuino single-board PC, from LinkSprite, runs Ubuntu, Android and sends output to HDMI while also being compatible with the Arduino ecosystem.  The pcDuino has Ethernet and Wi-Fi built in, and runs mostly Allwinner and ARM CPUs, programming in Java, Python, and other platforms is supported, as is an Arduino-style IDE.  With several members of the pcDuino family, prices are around PS40. This tiny, PS30 Linux and ARM-based single board can be used by many devices ranging from temperature and humidity monitors to web controlled power strips. Initially intended to serve as an affordable computer for children, it's primarily deployed in educational settings and by hobbyists.

      "content": "Chris Griffin, CEO at UK startup Anatwine, is thinking big. He aims to build a platform which will connect the best brands and retailers in the world into one \"hub and spoke system which would create the most powerful retail tool on the planet.\" So what does the relatively unknown startup from rural Cheltenham do? \"The easiest way for me to describe that is basically the why and how,\" says Griffin. \"I come from a fashion retail background and recognised both when I was in the industry and starting Anatwine that there were huge inefficiencies in the historic wholesale buy-in-advance model in fashion.\" Traditionally major brands like Superdry, Adidas and Nike sell stock to major online retailers like Zalando and ASOS according to linesheets put together by the brand. In the online world the complexity of the different systems being used by the major players means that there can be a lack of consistency for the customer, from product images and descriptions, to returns policies and delivery. This is where Anatwine comes in. The startup will send in solution consultants to do a top line analysis of the business and integrate their core systems into the Anatwine platform, so: pricing, inventory, orders and product content, all as close to real time as possible. The company's CTO Robert Sindall explained to Techworld.com: \"So rather than providing a thick API documentation to bend your systems to our requirements, we will build a bespoke integration.\" \"The two key complexities are building custom integrations and the complexity of fashion product data. So one of the barriers is the depth and range of product information retailers want and the various ways they describe products. We have a lot of clever technology that helps us transform the brand's data into our master canonical models.\" Anatwine then standardises this product data and the retailers requirements in the platform to ensure a consistent customer experience from both sides. \"So for example: does it ship within two to four days? We document that it has to be tracked, and even which specific carrier or packaging requirements, the order ID, customer number, logos. We document all of these requirements around what a brand must do to mimic the retailer, so that is the seamless experience,\" says Sindall. Griffin prefers to talk in case studies, and one he keeps returning to is between his ex-employer Superdry and the lead investor in Anatwine, who also happens to be one of the biggest retailers in Europe, Zalando. \"Take Superdry and Zalando. What would happen is the retailer would go to the brand and look at the range and nine months in advance they would use historic data to work out what to buy for the future and how much. In any other language: they would guess it. Yes they are guessing using data, but in advance work out what they thought would be the best sellers and drive their business going forward.\" A buyer at a retailer, like Zalando, or in the offline world a department store like Selfridges or House of Fraser, would hope that when they select items from a retailer's range they are choosing the bestselling items. However, Anatwine says that generally they will get it right 20 percent of the time. Griffin says that getting it right when you are \"buying months in advanced, using historic data, it's mathematically impossible.\" Their solution is to connect brands and retailers' supply chain systems so that retailers can see real time selling data to ensure they are pushing the best selling items, rather than guessing ahead of time. So the Anatwine approach is essentially based on two principles: \"If we can guarantee a consistent customer experience, and provide live data to only take the best stock when possible, this reduces warehouse capacity and allows [retailers] to give a fuller range to customers.\" Griffin says he already has 40 of the top 100 retailers globally signed up \"and the other 60 in my pipeline [...] Within two years we will connect the top 100 retailers to the top 100 brands.\" The benefit is mutual for the brands and the retailers according to Griffin, and will only improve as more join the platform. \"Retailers get increasingly accurate inventory and brands sell more stock on the right retailers.\" Anatwine then takes its cut on any incremental sales made on the platform. Anatwine secured $12 million in funding in June, including a minority shareholding from Zalando itself. ",

      "content": "All startups, be they merchants (think Uber or Airbnb) to ecommerce marketplaces (Lyst) to subscription services (SaaS companies like Slack), have one thing in common: the need to process payments. These need to be wherever the consumer wants to transact, be it web, mobile or in-app, and in a way that is so seamless that conversions are high and basket abandonment rates low. Before disruptive startups like Stripe, and PayPal before it, any company looking to accept card payments would have to go through the arduous and time consuming task of setting up a merchant account with a bank, which traditionally came with high fees and clunky online interfaces. Now online payments can be set up overnight if you have the right developers, as companies like Stripe, Braintree, Adyen and Worldpay provide robust APIs and software development kits (SDKs) for digital economy companies to start accepting card payments and subscriptions quickly, and without redirecting customers away from their site. But which one is best? The story of Stripe is a fairly well known in Silicon Valley circles, especially since CEO Patrick Collison, who cofounded the company with his brother John, appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine in November 2015 (headline: How John And Patrick Collison Built Stripe Into The PayPal Of The Mobile Era). Stripe was born out of a common software developer frustration. They kept finding that integrating payments was the most painful part of the process, as they had to deal with complex legacy systems built out by banks and incumbent payments providers. The solution is the core Stripe API, which is designed by developers for developers, complete with extensive documentation. Once in place, Stripe processes the payment through its own servers - so you don't have to store sensitive data or worry about being PCI compliant - takes a small percentage and checks for fraud. Stripe provides libraries in six programming languages, from Java to Go, as well as a host of community libraries. James Allgrove, head of UK growth at Stripe told Techworld.com: \"The way we think about it is it's a tool kit for developers to be able to build whatever they want with. We give you all of this functionality and you choose what you want to make use of and how you want to use it.\" Stripe also offers pre-built checkout and subscription solutions, so startups can start accepting payments quickly. The checkout simply requires a developer to drop a few lines of Javascript into the source code of their site or app to facilitate payments. Customers wont be redirected away from your site and the checkout is desktop and mobile optimised. Last year it launched a product called Relay, which allows developers to embed a 'buy' button within third-party apps, including Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter. Stripe's focus now is around mobile commerce, and eliminating the disconnect between mobile browsing and conversions. Allgrove says: \"People spend about 60% of their time on mobile devices but only 15% of all spending happens on mobile devices.\" Stripe doesn't disclose its payments volume but it does say it processes billions of pounds a year for tens of thousands of companies, including Deliveroo, Seedrs, Mondo, The Guardian and Boohoo in the UK. Pricing: Stripe charges 1.4% +20p for European cards and 2.9% + 20p for all others. Naturally the Forbes headline didn't go down well with the incumbent in the online payments space: PayPal. PayPal responded by saying that it, not Stripe, is the \"PayPal of the mobile era.\" One of the main gripes with PayPal was how it redirected you off the merchant's site to a PayPal screen, and required you to be a registered user of the service. Merchants don't want this level of friction when it comes to online purchases, especially on mobile.  This goes some way to explaining why PayPal acquired Braintree in 2013. Braintree is a virtually all-in-one solution, providing merchants with an account, payment gateway and the facility to automate recurring payments, including wallet style credit card storage and support for mobile and international payments. It counts huge digital economy players like Uber and Airbnb as customers and facilitated $50 billion in transactions in 2015. Braintree provides SDKs and fully customisable APIs in six programming languages, as well as pre-built shopping cart solutions. The recent launch of PayPal Commerce means merchants can embed contextual 'buy' buttons into apps like Pinterest and Facebook Messenger, akin to Stripe's Relay feature. All the security, scalability and reporting capabilities come with the API. Braintree also prides itself on its support, with phone-based support available for all customers. Although the technology and functionality look pretty similar, where Braintree has an advantage over Stripe is when startups look to scale internationally. Braintree can leverage the huge PayPal network and, although it offers basically the same number of currencies for consumers to pay with, it supports more settlement currencies, useful for larger startups that have bank accounts in other countries. Braintree also doesn't charge for foreign exchange. David Nunn, head of Braintree Europe told Techworld.com: \"Our target audience is developers and tech-first businesses at the forefront of commerce innovation.\" Nunn believes there are only two pure players in the online space because \"the toolkit Stripe and Braintree provide is far more extensive for mobile and requires less work for developers to bake in payments in a consistent way.\" Pricing: Braintree gives you your first PS30,000 in card processing free and then charges 1.9% + PS0.20 per transaction. American Express transactions are 2.4% + PS0.20. This is quite a lot cheaper than the standard Paypal rate of 3.4% to 1.9% + 20p per transaction. One of the better established payments providers in the UK is Worldpay, processing 26 million transactions a day. The developer-friendly Worldpay online payments integration comes in the form of an API which can be set up within 24 hours to accept card payments or start collecting subscription fees. Worldpay provides full documentation and support for developers. Once up and running developers can see real time transaction data and order management, with the ability to fulfil refunds in one click. Being an older company means Worldpay may struggle for the sort of agility a startup is looking for when it comes to a payments provider, especially when it comes to mobile and in-app payments. However it is a trusted name with lots of resource behind it and is making some admirable strides into the online payments world. Pricing: Worldpay charges 2.75% + 20p per transaction through its payment solution. Dutch company Adyen is more popular across Europe and provides a similar all-in-one solution for payments, with a robust API for processing card payments, taking subscription fees or powering an ecommerce business either online, in-app or in-store. Adyen claims Uber, Airbnb, Spotify and Netflix as customers. Pricing: Adyen's pricing model is more complex than the others on this list because it is based on volume and stated in Euros. There is a processing fee of between EUR0.080 and EUR0.10, as well as a payment method commission of between 0.48% to 0.60% depending on the payment method. If you are selling subscriptions to a service then London-based startup GoCardless might work for you. The payments solution focuses on recurring payments (Direct Debits, basically) and claims to charge businesses less than half what PayPal does for the same sort of solution. The pricing is a flat one percent of every transaction, capped at PS2, and provides an online portal to keep track of your payments.  Once you have your payments infrastructure up and running you can start thinking about adding consumer-friendly checkout options, such as PayPal, Apple Pay, Masterpass and solutions from other startups like Klarna. The Swedish startup Klarna launched in the UK in February with a select few merchants and specialises in allowing consumers to pay up to 14 days after delivery. The e-commerce startup Lyst recently adopted Klarna for its mobile and desktop payments, on top of Stripe. Lyst prides itself on its 'universal cart' technology, so working with multiple payments partners makes sense as it wants to support as many payment methods as possible, without taking customers away from its site. Etienne Martin, product manager at Lyst, told Techworld.com: \"The main reason we decided [on Klarna] was because it offered us great control over payments and the best option to help us integrate with more partners.\" \"Klarna is taking extra measures to optimise security and on top of that working with Klarna allows us to integrate all retailers with 3D security enabled which was not possible in the past. This means extra key brands available for our customers in the universal cart.\"  Martin has some advice for a startup looking to accept customer payments: \"There's no need to reinvent the wheel here. I'd advise starting with an established payment partner such as Klarna or Stripe, and work with them to make sure their product suits your business model. The most important thing to remember is that payment needs to be hassle free and as easy as possible - you don't want to take a risk here.\" On the surface it looks like there isn't much between the major online payments infrastructure providers. All are optimised for web, mobile and in-app purchases and support the major digital economy business models. All of them support the major payment methods (Visa, MasterCard and American Express) and integrate seamlessly with popular payment methods like PayPal, Klarna, Apple Pay and Android Pay. For me it is a straight shot between Stripe and Braintree, with Stripe edging it due to its complete focus on developers, strong leadership from the Collison brothers and price. ",

      "content": "London is widely considered to be the fintech capital of the world, thanks to its unique blend of being both a well-established financial centre and the leading tech city in Europe. So it comes as no surprise that so many fintech startups are starting to thrive within what is now valued as a PS20 billion industry. Here are the 10 fastest growing fintechs in the UK, according to data compiled by recruitment finance provider Sonovate. A digital banking service founded in 2013, Tandem holds PS22 million in current investments and has been valued at PS65 million. Based in London, the startup managed to raise PS1 million through crowdfunding within 20 minutes in May 2016. Tandem tops the chart with a whopping 2333 percent employee growth rate. NoviCap is a London-based alternative finance startup that allows professional investors to provide working capital directly to businesses. Since founding in 2014 they closed a PS1.3 million seed round and currently have around PS2.6 million in funding. With a focus on redefining invoice finance, the startup has an employee growth rate of 933 percent.  Atom Bank, headquartered in Durham, is UK's first bank entirely run through a mobile app. With over 100 current employees, the employee growth rate is 896 percent. Valued at PS150 million before launch, the bank was the first mobile only to be licensed by the Bank of England in 2015. Atom also offers biometric security with voice and face recognition features.  Founded in 2014, Thought Machine is building technology to revolutionise outdated banking. They have created Vault OS, an operating system for banks that runs on the cloud. Based in London with an employee growth rate of 850 percent, the startup works with banks that want to innovate. A platform that delivers intelligent background checks for businesses, the company has a total investment of around PS23 million across the UK and US. They were founded in 2012 and have headquarters in London. Onfido has already run over 10 million background checks for over 1,000 customers. Sonovate provides contract management software for recruitment businesses and a digital platform which aids businesses with contract admin. Founded in 2012 with headquarters in London, current funding totals around PS17 million with an employee growth rate of 350 percent. A cyber situational awareness platform in the security sector, this fintech startup was founded in 2011. The scalable data analysis platform helps organisations protect against cyber attacks, loss of intellectual property, and loss of brand and reputational integrity. Digital Shadows has raised approximately PS17 million in funding with an employee growth rate of 276 percent. It is jointly headquartered in London and San Francisco.  TransferWise is a cross borders payment service enabling customers around the world to perform money transfers at a lower cost than bigger banks. The fintech was started in 2011 with current funding at about PS69 million. With headquarters in London and over 100 employees, they move  PS500 million every month globally.  DoPay is a completely integrated online banking platform that allows employers to pay employees without bank accounts electronically. This London-based fintech is a payroll platform, online bank and account all rolled into one. Current funding totals about PS6 million with an employee growth rate of 244 percent.  This innovative banking software streamlines the process of tracking expenses for accountants and businesses by organising and storing financial data. Founded in 2010 with headquarters in London, the fintech has approximately PS11.5 million in funding and an employee growth rate of 221 percent. Receipt Bank extracts key data from receipts and invoices and stores them in the appropriate locations.  ",

      "content": "The marketing tech (MarTech) and advertising tech (AdTech) landscape (MadTech for short) is an extremely busy one, as shown by this mind-boggling landscape illustration from Chiefmartec.com. The United States has been producing successful MarTech companies for the last decade and Europe is only just catching up. According to Techcitynews.com: \"Although North America remains the most active region for merger and acquisition deals in the adtech/martech sector, with 51 percent of the total global deal volume in Q2 2015, other regions are eating away at its dominance.\" The figures show that western Europe's share of deal volumes rose from 13 percent to 18 percent, over the same period, according to data from specialist marcoms and tech M&A consultancy Results International, and there is a small but growing cohort of UK startups in the space. Deborah Hennessy is an advisor at The Sandpit, a \"business builder\" for MadTech startups in London which helps founders take their products to market. She says the UK is \"playing catch up\" in the space and that: \"Tech that has real product market fit and are answering problems that make marketers lives easier and helps customers, rather than push things on them. These will be the companies that succeed.\" For this list we are focusing on startups from the UK that can help marketing teams to improve their productivity and the reach of their campaigns, from handy platforms to useful tools for marketing and advertising professionals. London-based startup Qubit is rounding into maturity beyond life as a startup, with over 260 employees. Qubit raised a massive PS40 million in Series C funding in February, led by Goldman Sachs. Clients include retail giants like Topshop and Uniqlo as well as travel brands Thomas Cook and TUI. Qubit focuses on digital customer experiences, particularily around web optimisation and personalisation across digital touchpoints (mobile, web, customer service, etc.), the holy grail for web marketers and ecommerce companies. The \"marketing hub\" platform was developed by four ex-Google employees. It allows teams to do real-time analytics, segmentation, A/B testing and web personalisation all on one platform called the Visitor Cloud. The platform is built on open-source software. Unsurprisingly considering the Google heritage at the company, it is underpinned by the Apache HBase database, allowing for low-latency data processing. The front-end is built with simplicity in mind, with drag and drop usability and the Visitor Cloud integrates with existing ecommerce and web content management (WCM) platforms. Unruly is another of those companies that is on the cusp of no longer being a startup, with co-CEO Sarah Wood going on a hiring binge at the end of 2015, bringing the employee count up to around 250 across twelve markets. That's before you consider that it was acquired by the media goliath News Corp in 2014 for PS58 million, but the leadership hasn't changed, with Wood still very much in charge. Unruly is a video advertising platform which promises that most ephemeral of qualities for marketers: video virality. Wood says: \"Our mission is to deliver the most awesome social video campaigns on the planet, so this is video advertising for brands [...] We don't make the videos but we make them famous.\" Unruly tools for advertisers include: ShareRank, a predictive algorithm which claims to evaluate the shareabaility of a video ad before launch; Activate, a programmatic video platform; and an analytics suite for tracking and benchmarking of online video ads. Unruly has run campaigns for major brands including Adidas, Coca-Cola, Guinness and Selfridges. Another MarTech startup concentrating on video is Smartzer. Smartzer is an HTML5 video player where an invisible overlay makes items within a video clickable, for increased conversions. Brands provide Smartzer with their video and the product links they would like to include and its staff process and return the video, as well as an analytics dashboard, normally within the same day. So how does this differ from the monolith of the online video world, YouTube? \"Smartzer provides a new way to drive engagement with video where the viewer can access more information about the content when they want to, as opposed to being pushed advertising as pre rolls or banners over the video,\" a representative from the company told Techworld.com. Smartzer offers monthly subscriptions or a fully customised player and has worked with retailers Marks and Spencer, Barbour and QVC. The company has raised PS450,000 in seed funding from a plethora of angel investors. One of the many platforms to help marketers and advertisers optimise their social advertising spend is Glow Digital Media. Glow gives digital marketers a single workflow to build paid social campaigns across platforms. The ad management platform is built on three tenets: build, manage and optimise. Glow uses proprietary and open social data to identify its most engaged and profitable customers not just on Facebook but across social media platforms. With Facebook continuing to dominate the mobile advertising market, companies like Glow are well placed to help marketers optimise their ad spend on the platform. It is even one of Facebook's few Preferred Marketing Developers (PMD). Glow has worked with companies like mobile game developer King and music streaming site Spotify for their social advertising campaigns. Glow raised PS4.85 million in Series A funding led by Notion Capital and White Star Capital back in July 2014. Adludio specialises in what it calls \"programmatic sensory advertising\" for mobile. So interactive advertising units optimised for mobile delivery - instead of a static ad it will include an interactive element, say a button or a swipe, for instance. Co-founder Howard Kingston said: \"We help brands look really cool on mobile phones.\" His co-founder Jacques Kotze goes into a bit more detail: \"From a tech perspective you have to solve how a small team can produce a lot of 'creative' with limited time and resource.\" Adludio allows designers to build interactive ad units in a familiar format, based on Photoshop templates. It then generates a feature-rich HTML5 ad, distributed through the canvas tag, without requiring any coding knowledge. Finally there is the optimisation Adludio delivers. A single piece of creative can be optimised by the Adludio algorithms. This will generate variations of the ad unit, test them live and effectively kill off the least effective units according to pre-set KPIs. Think of it like automating your A/B testing but also extending it to A/Z testing. Adludio mostly works with media and creative agencies, working on ads for clients like Nike, Unilever and Red Bull. The startup has raised $2.7 million (PS2.05 million) in funding so far, with seed investors including Episode 1, Passion Capital and Balderton Capital. Attest is a London-based startup looking to bring a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) approach to market research, giving businesses live access to a pool of respondents to conduct market research in real-time. Where the incumbent model sees brands go to established market research agencies for expensive reports which take weeks to deliver, the Attest platform aims to give businesses quick insights about their products or adverts. The simple platform allows you to ask the pool of roughly 1.3 million active users a question or questions. You can review and share the responses as they come in. Results are displayed in bar charts, with either the number of respondents or a percentage. The pool of respondents and results can be parsed by demographics, no pivot tables required. Attest charges a flat PS0.25 per completed response and says that it can access the sort of young, affluent respondents that normal market research cannot. CEO Jeremy King told Techworld.com: \"Our entire business is built around the respondents and the ability to get the higher value respondents, the more affluent and more valuable people that don't tend to do research.\" Attest raised $3.1 million (PS2.5 million) in funding led by Oxford Capital, and Episode 1 in April 2017, in addition to PS1 million in seed funding in October 2015 from Episode 1. Shoreditch-based startup Adthena helps brands see what their competitors are doing in terms of search advertising spend. The 'search intelligence platform' allows advertisers to identify 'brand infringements', new keywords and developing search strategy from rivals. Brand infringement is when rival brands pay to rank on searches for competing products. Interflora and Marks and Spencer are currently locked in a court battle over brand infringement. The Adthena platform is cloud based and monitors over 3.5 million search pages, 70 million ads and 170,000 new ad copies every day and billions of search ads each month, totalling 500 terabytes of data. Adthena customers include Adobe, American Express and Toyota. The company has raised over PS1 million in seed funding to date from a selection of angel investors, facilitated by Angels Den. Have you ever been bombarded with online adverts for a product you already own? Verticly is a startup that promises to connect the dots between online and offline customer data. The software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform allows brands to: \"Create fully interactive mobile experiences that link any advertising touch-point to both high street real estate and ecommerce sites.\" Verticly helps marketers determine which channels are driving the best conversions and allocate spend accordingly. It links together customers accounts to enable better tracking of their online activity to help avoid delivering pointless ads. Verticly has worked with PG Tips, Unliever and Empire Cinemas. It raised PS760,000 in venture capital in March, led by Northstar Ventures and PJ Tech. Hailing from Newcastle, SoPost allows brands to drive product sampling online. The platform looks to generate goodwill towards your brand by delivering free samples to targeted fans on social media. Brands will get an account manager who will help build a campaign to deliver a link to potential customers where they can redeem their free sample. SoPost even gives customers access to its distribution network, based in Bedford in the UK and Illinois in the USA. The platform also allows you to capture information and collect feedback from those who receive your samples, as opposed to just handing out samples at a train station and hoping they engage with the brand. SoPost is a graduate of The Sandpit and has raised nearly PS485,000 in seed funding to date, with the bulk of the funding led by Northstar Ventures. It has already worked with a number of leading fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) brands including Benefit, Cadburys and Britvic. Stash applies itself specifically to influencer-based campaigns, helping marketers find the right people without wading through spreadsheets. Stash combines metrics for influencers on reach, engagement and audience demographics to help find the right people to engage for your campaign. Stash is essentially a customer relationship management (CRM) system for influencers. It stores all of your communication with influencers so that you never lose track of relationships and can keep the whole team on the same page, allowing team members to pick up the conversation at any point. The platform can also be used to track performance and deliver analytics reports after campaigns. Stash says that it removes the time-consuming process of \"collecting social data, assessing the quality of content, understanding the influencers' audiences and checking previous brand affiliations\" pre-campaign. Stash has raised just shy of PS400,000 so far and is in the process of another funding round at the time of writing. E-mail marketing can be extremely hit and miss. However UK startup Phrasee is looking to bring artificial intelligence technology to subject line optimisation, and its CTO Dr Neil Yager knows a thing or two about the subject. Phrasee uses language generation algorithms to understand your brand's tone of voice and generate appropriate subject lines. In practice what this means is email marketers will be supplied with a more data-driven list of optimised subject lines to choose from, saving them time and a reliance on gut feeling. Being a machine learning algorithm means the more you use Phrasee the better it gets at driving results, namely open rates and conversions. The tool integrates with your existing email service provider (ESP). The startup says that Virgin Holidays has seen a 42 percent increase in email response since adding Phrasee to their marketing stack. Other customers include House of Fraser and TheTicketFactory.com. Imagine you are listening to Katy Perry's California Gurls, while on holiday in Los Angeles, on your free Spotify account only to be hit with an ad that refers to you by name and recommends a local restaurant because it knows your location.  Creepy or brilliant? A Million Ads is an early-stage startup looking to use its technology to contextualise a single advertisement brief into 'a million ads' across video and music platforms. Lara Pizzato, head of marketing at The Sandpit, where A Million Ads is currently working, told Techworld.com: \"Data from the publisher and the campaign brief from advertisers are fed into an engine so that they can create a million different ads, which are personalised even down to your name.\"  From the small Kent town of Sevenoaks in the south of England, WatchMyCompetitor.com does what it says on the tin: a dashboard for monitoring your competitors products, promotions, social media activity and pricing changes 24/7. The cloud based software can be personalised with competitors and relevant alerts and is \"always on.\" Unilever, Umbro and Aberdeen Asset Management are all counted as customers. Once a darling of the UK-tech scene, Yieldify recently had to contend with a raft of lawsuits in which the Google-backed startup was accused of stealing code from rivals. It has since settled with Bounce Exchange. The name comes from the core idea of Yieldify, and something all ecommerce sites want: to increase the yield, or conversions, it is getting from its web traffic by retaining visitors and reducing customer abandonment. It does this by tracking customer behaviour, like browsing habits and mouse movements to offer personalised suggestions and offers. The software is free to download and use and Yieldify only charges clients if they make money as a result. ",

      "content": "Tech leaders including venture capitalists and fintech startup founders have weighed in on how Brexit will affect the UK's booming tech sector at the Fintech Beyond Borders event during London Fintech Week. Although it is still too early to say what impact Brexit will have on the ability of UK companies to hire and retain talent, the fintech industry is clearly thinking about the issue, and planning for all eventualities. Hiroki Takeuchi, cofounder of the UK fintech startup GoCardless said: \"For me I think the number one thing is open access to people.\" Takeuchi speaks from experience having recently had to jump through hoops to get a potential employee a visa. He told the story: \"We now need to go and put the job on some stupid website, where we wait for 90 days for a bunch of dross to apply and then we have to give a specific reason why we have rejected every single person from these job centre places and then we can make the offer, we can't make a formal offer before that. So it is a crazy, crazy system.\" So how does he see this changing post-Brexit? \"Everybody talks about it like it is a binary thing,\" he says. \"Like you're either in London or not in London. I think one of the things that is likely to happen is the way companies grow is likely to be more distributed.\"  Jeff Lynn, CEO at crowdfunding startup Seedrs, had a different perspective. Speaking about the difficulty of getting visas for potential employees he says: \"That kind of stuff hits fast and lean startups disproportionately hard. If you are a big bank and you have a major HR function and you are constantly going through these sort of processes and delays then fine. \"If you are a business whose entire competitive advantage is based on being able to move fast and getting the right talent and you are waiting six months for things to clear then that's a real problem.\" His solution draws from the Australian approach to immigration. \"To me a huge portion of whether Brexit is a significant problem turns on whether there is a legitimate and useable points-based immigration system,\" said Lynn. When asked what fintech companies need most, Rob Moffat, a partner at VC firm Balderton Capital said: \"I think the movement of talent. I agree with Hiroki's point and maybe it won't be exactly the same as it is now.\" When asked if talent is more important than capital the VC said: \"Capital is much less important for the average early stage fintech.\" When asked if working in fintech is becoming too risky for top talent, Moffat said: \"Fintech has become less risky. I have a bunch of friends that work in IT in investment banks and that is an ugly place to be right now. That was always a complaint about London. That you couldn't hire good engineers because the investment banks would offer them three times the salary and that is less and less the case.\" Lynn added: \"No one left the big banks because it was the safe option. They left the big banks because it was soul crushing and they wanted something more exciting and dynamic and that isn't going to change one bit.\" Liz Lumley, managing director at the startup incubator startupbootcamp says bluntly: \"Attracting talent and keeping them in the country is a barrier.\" Lumley also speaks passionately about the difficulty of access to financial services in the UK for migrant workers, and how fintech startups could make this better. \"Last year my biggest problem as MD at startupbootcamp was getting bank accounts for either personal or business accounts for our partners. Lloyds Banking Group is one of our partners and they came in yesterday to explain the whole procedure and they said \"we will talk to our branch so you can go down there\". The branch? This is still the world we live in and fintech changes that.\" Summing up the event, Cameron Stevens, the founder of Prodigy Finance, a startup that looks to provide funding for top international students to attend universities around the world, said: \"I think there is a consensus on one hand that talent is the key issue for people and ensuring that it is open and that doesn't change. \"If it goes and closes borders and chooses after this Brexit to shut down that ability to tap into a global talent pool I think that will start to make startups to consider either Hiroki's distributed teams approach, or the more extreme version of thinking about greener pastures.\" ",

      "content": "There is one group you cannot avoid within the tech startup community/scene/bubble (delete as appropriate): venture capitalists. Everyone, it seems, has opinions about them. Talk to any startup founder and chances are, even if they haven't ever spoken to a VC before, they will have a view on what they do, what their role within the startup ecosystem is and what it should be. Some of those that have dealt with VCs will wax lyrical about their investors. Others may be a bit more sanguine about the experience of engaging with VCs: being too demanding (for example over future direction of the company, or hiring and firing) or just not being the right fit are two common complaints. You could argue that VCs get more attention than they should, given the vast majority of tech companies function without ever receiving VC investment. VCs are behind the biggest names in tech: Uber, Facebook, Just Eat, Airbnb, Snapchat, and more recently in the UK, Funding Circle, Deliveroo and WorldRemit, to name but a few. This perhaps helps to explain their allure, and they do have a significant impact on the economy. However the fact remains that most tech startups not only can't but in fact should not go down the route of courting VCs for investment. At best it can be a distraction and a waste of time, and at worst it can be a huge, company-threatening mistake. Many startups do not understand how rare and odd it is to qualify for VC funding, according to Boris Golden who is himself a VC, a principal at Partech Ventures. \"Startups sometimes don't understand how odd it is to qualify for a VC. Only a very small percentage of companies are suitable. They need to match two main things: they need to have huge potential - say, to become a unicorn [a company worth over a billion dollars]. The second is they need to have the ambition to do that,\" he adds.  Perhaps startups should think a lot earlier and harder before engaging with VCs - and most of them should avoid it. The good news is we are here to help. Here are a few of the instances where you shouldn't go to a VC. VCs demand rapid growth so they can get a large and fast return on the cash they inject. If that doesn't sound like your startup, you should probably avoid seeking one out. \"I think if you go with a VC you have to have a very aggressive growth plan. If you are more the type of founder who wants a slower, steadier, solid, good business then it's probably not right to go to a VC. It is for a specific sort of business need,\" says Luis Hanemann, partner at e.ventures. Omri Benayoun, partner at Partech Ventures, agrees: \"By their nature VCs seek good returns: 15 to 20 percent. The British economy is growing at about two percent. So it's not for everyone. \"If you want steady growth, a VC will not be okay with that strategy. You have to have a strategy that complies with the VC strategy of having very large growth within a large market. It'll be an unhappy experience.\" Nikki Albano founded Reviews.co.uk (its 4,000 customers include Ocado and GoCompare) with her husband in 2011, but they have made a conscious decision not to seek VC funding. \"We talked to a few VCs in the early days. But we realised they just didn't share our passion for the business and where we wanted to take it, so we decided VC money wasn't the right path for us,\" she says. \"It's an enormously time consuming exercise and we believe it's time better spent improving our solution. We get offers to buy the business, but we don't even consider them, we've only just begun,\" Albano adds. It's a view that is not just held by startups. VC partner Omri Benayoun admits taking venture capital will result in losing control over your startup, at least to some extent. \"You may want to avoid VCs if you want to keep control. Having them join as investors means you get capital and advice, but does limit your freedom,\" he says. Although VCs understandably try to invest in startups as early as possible, that doesn't mean you should approach one the second you register your company. You need to get a bit more time, experience and hard knocks under your belt first. At least that's what David J Brown, founder and CEO of tech firm Ve Interactive suggests. \"For any business which is not ready or doesn't have a regularised business - which is not already proven with many cycles behind it - a VC will often see some of those things as a failure, and start to impose different controls and measures, and very quickly the innovation and agility of a business can be crushed,\" he says. There is sometimes a mismatch between VC and founder expectations when they enter into discussions, and it is neither 'good' nor 'bad' to take VC funding, according to Golden at Partech Ventures. \"It would avoid a lot of friction between VCs and entrepreneurs if everyone was clearer when it is and is not appropriate to go to a VC. A lot of entrepreneurs are very disappointed dealing with VCs: they waste a lot of time and get no interest,\" he says. The best way to explain this is to consider how the VC business model actually works. If the startup raises a small PS1 million round from VCs early on, there is already an expectation that there will eventually be a PS100 million exit, according to Golden. \"If you believe you can do that, go to a VC. But if you can't, don't as a good VC will not invest. It is just the maths,\" he explains. ",

      "content": "The internet of things has gone from a much-hyped new area within technology several years ago to a far more routine, mature sector. For evidence of that, look no further than startups like OpenSensors. It was launched in 2013 by developers Yodit Stanton and Malcom Sparks. Since then it has gone from a two-person operation to a company with 10 staff handling 15 million sensor messages every single day. Where OpenSensors differs to other IoT companies, which may specialise in consultancy or hardware, is its focus on open data. \"We've seen both the IoT and open data market mature while we mature,\" says Stanton. \"It's definitely stuck.\"  The idea for the company first spawned from Stanton's care for her oldest child who has asthma, a condition that can be badly aggravated by poor air quality. At the time, Stanton says, there was plenty of macro-level data about air quality but local information wasn't available. The company set up an air monitoring project called 'Breathe Heathrow', which promised to 'democratise data' by getting local residents to create sensors around the airport to collect data on air quality and noise impacts. It's a serious issue: air pollution kills 9,500 Londoners every year, according to King's College London. The scheme provided useful lessons in how to foster bottom-up, open data-driven projects within local authorities and communities and a repeatable data-driven methodology for such initiatives. \"The things you create out of your own frustration can often seem to work the best,\" says Stanton. \"Now there's worldwide air quality data from various publishers in Europe and North America, and that's starting to turn into content,\" she explains. \"Some local newspapers are even putting that data onto their sites.\" The cofounders initially bootstrapped for the first few months, and have managed to grow reasonably sustainably so far, according to Stanton. \"We took some angel funding, but very little,\" she says. \"We were in a lucky position of having enough revenue to pay salaries. So that kind of organic growth is working well so far. It's early days still obviously so we're still trying to figure out what we're doing, what people want.\" Stanton has mixed feelings about whether the company should take venture capital cash; or at least too complex to be reduced to a pithy quote. There are advantages and disadvantages in engaging with VCs and they vary enormously by company or even individual.  \"In the early days, everything you do is unproven. In my opinion the focus for the early days of a startup should be about scaling the learning curve and figuring out what your customers want as quickly as possible before you run out of cash,\" she says.  OpenSensors now has over 10,000 users, with each of its customers managing from 2,000 to 20,000 sensors every year. They include big names like Cisco, TripAdvisor, Reuters and Arup. Most of OpenSensors' clients tend to work within the commercial building, engineering, infrastructure and manufacturing sector. Any sectors where there are \"lots of moving parts\" and goods to be tracked tend to be suitable for OpenSensors, according to Stanton. \"We help companies manage their sensor network, but at the same time you can have a load of open data overlaying your private organisation's data, which gives you much better analytics,\" Stanton explains. For example, an art gallery could overlay visitor footfall data, picked up by sensors, with open data on the weather and traffic on given days, allowing them to predict what future visitor numbers will be like. However, the most valuable deployments tend to be slightly more routine and focused on efficiency gains, according to Stanton: \"IoT tends to be most useful if you have physical infrastructure costing you money, energy firms for example. Deploying sensors is like having 1 million extra people working there: you have eyes on stuff and if it breaks you know about it immediately.\" One benefit is that this helps to save money by avoiding pointlessly replacing systems or machinery, Stanton adds.  OpenSensors has not seen much traction within the local authorities, perhaps suggesting the 'smart city' is still more of a buzzword than reality. \"I don't think many councils can afford smart city deployments,\" she says. \"They don't have any money and what's being sold are usually multi-million pound massive five-year enterprise deals. Plus, for the most part it's very hard to navigate the procurement process.\" Instead, Stanton believes the 'smart cities' ideal will come about from community-level deployments - people \"doing things they care about\" - rather than top-down schemes. There have been some IoT projects within local government but they tend to focus on areas like parking, which help to raise revenue, according to Stanton. The current team at OpenSensors has been drawn from a variety of backgrounds, but many of them have worked in banking in some way or another. Stanton herself worked in Lehman Brothers' tech department before the investment bank went bust. And she admits that for startups in competitive industries, it's not often enough just to focus on products: \"We are very engineering-led. We just focused on products initially but in the last year or so we've had to do more sales. There's nothing wrong with that but we aren't very used to it. If you're crap at sales, no one just says 'never mind, you're a startup, have some money anyway'. You just fail.\" OpenSensors graduated from the Open Data Institute's startup incubator last year and is now loosely based around a working space within Google Campus in Shoreditch, east London. Rather than renting a full-time office or headquarters, the business has a distributed working structure where people work wherever is most convenient. The real tie that binds the team together is that they all have experience working with a programming language called Clojure. \"It's a niche language we all happened to learn that we love,\" Stanton says. \"We use Clojure for OpenSensors' systems too.\" It's particularly good for dealing with big data as it allows programming on multicore processors, according to Stanton. One of the biggest milestones so far was when the company hit 10 million daily messages, she says. \"We realised this isn't just us and a few of our mates. This is real. Then large content providers started asking if they can use our data. That was cool. It's when it transitions from a project between you and people you know to an international thing. It's like okay, this is serious,\" Stanton adds. It is clear that running a startup is a far cry from the more stable environment of working in a big corporate (albeit one in banking). Stanton seems to be thriving from the pressure - but she admits it is tough. \"It is very difficult running a startup versus running a job,\" she admits. \"You have so many different things to do and you have to be fairly good at all of them. You also constantly worry about whether you are making the right choices.\" On the plus side, Stanton says cofounding a startup has given her so many skills she wouldn't have had otherwise. \"I've moved up about 10 years of experience,\" she says. \"In a corporate environment it would take ages to get to this level of responsibility. It is hugely stressful, however, and you can't switch off!\"    Stanton splits her time half and half between the customers and product development, and then does admin on weekends. Most of her time is spent 'firefighting': fixing problems then handing them onto staff members once solved. \"I guess I'm probably completely unemployable now,\" Stanton laughs. She doesn't sound remotely unhappy about it.   ",

      "content": "The two year old French company Early Metrics has set up shop in London as it aims to become the rating agency for startups, bringing an objective methodology to assess a startup's potential growth.   Like all good startups, Early Metrics is turning the incumbent business model on its head. Traditional rating agencies like Moody's or Standard & Poor's charge the company they are rating in exchange for the kudos of that rating.  This creates a fair deal of conflict of interest, so Early Metrics charges the clients, venture capitalists and large corporations, for access to a startup's ratings and a full report. Instead of rating a company's credit risk, Early Metrics is concerned with a company's growth potential. Cofounder Antoine Baschiera says it is pre-due diligence rather than due dilligence, and more of a risk management tool. The ratings are \"decision agnostic\" according to Baschiera, meaning it's not just for investors but also large corporates looking to partner with innovative startups or companies exploring acqui-hiring (acquiring a company more for the people than the product). The analysts, who tend to be experts in their fields - whether enterprise software or fintech - can rate a company in around 20 hours, and ex IBM and HP employees are among Early Metrics' ranks.  For a startup to get rated they simply have to ask Early Metrics nicely, comply with an interview, and supply the necessary documentation - a three-hour job according to Baschiera. The startup then receives a two-page certificate with their rating out of 100 and some top line objective insights such as SWOT analysis and market overview.  The company also signs a non-disclosure agreement so that their rating can't be shared with any Early Metrics clients without their express permission. Startups are used to removing middle men from the equation, but this one looks like a no-brainer, which is probably why Early Metrics has a 95 percent hit rate when contacting startups, according to Baschiera.  Clients then have the option to pay a PS2,000 monthly fee to access the entire client base, from which they will be delivered select reports on companies that fit their investment portfolio. Or they can pay PS3,000 per rating on a specific company of interest. Early London clients include HSBC, Visa, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson. Early Metrics claim that its rating methodology is scientific and completely objective. The methodology is built on three pillars: managers/founders, technology and market. Baschiera explains the logic behind assessing founders: \"We work with HR, psychologists and VCs to first identify what were the key skills that an entrepreneur needs to have. Some are hard skills, such as technical mastery, financial mastery and so on but a lot of them are soft skills, such as the capacity to self-assess.\"  When asked how they can be objective when assessing something as ephemeral as leadership, Baschiera admits that it isn't \"black and white\" but research shows there are certain patterns that can be used to predict if a team will succeed. Early Metrics weights management over the technology and market aspects when it comes to the final rating. Early Metrics doesn't try to assess how innovative a startup's technology or service is, but rather how likely the idea is to become a minimum viable product or service. It takes a deep look at the business model, the overall market, execution speed, and the startup's business plan for the development of the project. For the market, Early Metrics' analysts study volume, depth and evolution by looking at things like the balance of power between the different non-competitors players (like clients and suppliers), the regulatory environment, the type and intensity of the competition, and barriers to entry.  Finally, there's the financials: Early Metrics measures the quality and coherency of the financial statements to provide an idea about the manager's financial ability.  Of course, no methodology is 100 percent accurate, but two years in and Early Metrics is already seeing a strong correlation between its ratings and business success down the line.  According to Baschiera: \"78 percent of the companies rated more than 75, which is a good rating, have shown concrete proof of success 12 months later, in terms of how much they have raised, the relative growth of the team or revenue growth. On the other hand more than 80 percent of the companies with a bad rating have underperformed twelve months later.\" So, how good is London's startup ecosystem according to these methods? \"The London ecosystem is so mature,\" says Baschiera, \"the need to stand out from the crowd is higher than across Europe.\" The quality of Britain's fintech and martech startups stands out for Baschiera. But, he says, for pure B2B software and hardware, other countries in Europe are stronger - including Germany and France.  Finally, Baschiera has one piece of advice for getting a good rating: \"Focus on building the team, let yourself be challenged, that is when the idea starts to develop,\" he says. \"Focus on qualitative metrics like the quality of the team and the feedback of your first beta users.\"  \"Rather than trying to achieve huge volume from day one it is better to focus on a smaller pool of users and to have really interesting retention metrics at the beginning.\" ",

      "content": "You may have heard one or two rumblings about a UK artificial intelligence company called DeepMind after it was bought by Google in January 2014.  Here are 10 things worth knowing about the new Google division that's aiming to \"solve intelligence\".   DeepMind's aim was to make machines capable of learning things for themselves. It plans to do this by creating a set of powerful general-purpose learning algorithms that can be combined to make an AI system or \"agent\".  The exact sum was never revealed but it's believed the Silicon Valley internet giant acquired DeepMind for between PS300 million and PS400 million.  At the time of the acquisition, DeepMind was a two-year-old startup, founded by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. Interestingly, Demis is a former child chess prodigy. Mustafa Suleyman said the team were \"very proud\" when they found out their work was going to be featured on the front cover of Nature.  Dark Blue Labs and Vision Factory, both founded by Oxford professors, were snapped up by DeepMind in October 2015 for undisclosed sums.  DeepMind believes the media focuses too much hyping up AI science fiction stories and linking them to films like Ex-Machina and The Terminator.  \"We're building them [AIs] to empower humanity, absolutely not to destroy us,\" said cofounder Mustafa Suleyman.  Interestingly, DeepMind has forced Google to create an ethics board to determine how it stewards its own technology. Last year Google appointed a board but it is yet to reveal who is on it.  Although, we do know that Google joined along with other tech giants, 'Partnership on AI', aimed at promoting ethical AI research and putting together a standard for AI development.   Mustafa Suleyman and Demis Hassabis were among a group of investors that backed mobile ticketing startup Dice in an unreported PS1.3 million funding round this summer, building on the PS1 million it raised in August 2015.  In March 2016,  AlphaGo, an AI system built by DeepMind and South Korean 'Go' champion Lee Sedol played five 'Go' matches. AlphaGo managed to win the series of games 4-1. 'Go' is a strategy-led board game in which two players aim to gather and surround the most territory on the board. The game is said to require a certain level of intuition and be considerably more complex than Chess. The first three games were won by AlphaGo with Sedol winning the fourth round, but still unable to claim back a victory. If Sedol had been overall winner, he would have received $1 million. Instead, the prize fund has been donated to Unicef.  See also: Computer vs humans: Five times AI has beaten humans in competitions University of Oxford scientists have teamed up with DeepMind in order to stop artificial intelligent agents learning how to prevent humans from taking full control of them. Illustrated in Safely Interruptible Agents, the University of Oxford team explains: \"If such an agent is operating in real-time under human supervision, now and then it may be necessary for a human operator to press the big red button to prevent the agent from continuing a harmful sequence of actions - harmful either for the agent or for the environment - and lead the agent into a safer situation.\" The researchers have proposed a framework that aims to prevent these dangerous situations, highlighting:  \"We have proposed a framework to allow a human operator to repeatedly safely interrupt a reinforcement learning agent while making sure the agent will not learn to prevent or induce these interruptions.\" Find out more about this 'framework' here. Last year, DeepMind announced a partnership with the NHS in which it will use machine learning to recognise life-threatening conditions detected in the eye and degenerative eye conditions. London's Moorfields Eye Hospital will be the home of the new machine learning technology what should take a digital scan of the eye to determine its condition.  This technology will help those with diabetes who are 25 percent more likely to lose their sight dues to the medical condition.  ",

      "content": "In the world of technology startups, we often hear about venture capitalists. However, we rarely hear explanations about who they are, the role they play, how they operate and how they fit into the bigger funding picture. We're going to help answer some of those questions here, starting with the most obvious... A venture capitalist or 'VC' is, quite simply, an investor. They invest money in startups and high-growth companies in exchange for equity, or more commonly, a share in the company. They are in some ways similar to fund managers, but they are far closer to and more personally involved in their investments (the startups). They tend to specialise and invest within a particular area, for example technology sectors like fintech. The return on investment varies, but on average it is expected that the money the VCs invest will be returned between five to 10 years after the initial investment, via the company exiting (selling to another company) or going public. VCs expect the funds they invest in to approximately triple in value over that time. Although not all of their investments will succeed, VCs expect that by investing in a variety of firms they will spread the risk and find a few runaway successes to mitigate any failures. Most VC firms have associate and partner levels of employment. Associates usually meet with startups at the initial phase and find potential investments, while partners get involved when the deal becomes more serious. An associate can be promoted to partner once they've generated solid returns to the firm. An average day for a VC would include meetings with companies, networking at various events and researching investments. Most of the money VCs use to invest comes from a variety of external sources such as pension funds, charitable foundations, insurance companies, wealthy individuals and international corporations. The partners of a VC firm also typically invest their own money into the fund, although it is usually in single-digit percentages of the overall fund, with the majority coming from external sources. VCs typically invest during what is called the 'Series A' round of investment. This is followed alphabetically by 'Series B' and 'Series C' rounds, which raise increasing amounts as they go and often involve larger numbers of investors at each stage. Before that you get the 'Pre A' or 'Series AA' seed rounds, which are the earliest stages of investment with the most risk. These rounds tend to raise less money than venture capital and include angel investing, family/friend backing and crowdfunding. Angel investors have some similarities to VCs, but they usually operate alone and provide a more advisory role. VCs tend to focus on investing in risky, innovative startups with high growth potential and crucially, founders with a vision they trust and that they believe can succeed. They also invest in companies that are a little older but at a stage where they have demonstrable results and are focusing on boosting their expansion. Given they invest huge sums into startups it is important that they believe there will be a high return rate if successful. VCs are less likely to invest in firms that don't have aggressive growth plans, i.e. companies who prefer to focus on slower but steadier, solid business growth. Many VCs specialise within particular areas: technology or even sectors within technology like security, clean technology or fintech. VCs will look at metrics like customer acquisition, potential size of the market, solid planning, product traction and customer lifetime value when weighing up a startup. However, at the earlier stage their main focus will be on the founding team and their vision for the business, and whether they offer a great product or service with high potential. A lot of the success of an investment relies on a good VC/founder relationship where they are able to communicate openly, be flexible, and be able to cope with unplanned and potentially negative events - which is almost inevitable when launching a company. Although the main focus tends to be on the money that VCs inject into startups, they usually provide far more than just cash. They can act as a sounding board for the founder or founding team's ideas, offer advice and provide access to their network, just to name a few advantages. Many of them have set up their own company and/or worked within the world of technology or investment, so have invaluable contact books as well as perspectives from personal experience. There is no single, clear path to becoming a VC, although they do all seem to have high levels of job satisfaction as a common thread. Some VCs have backgrounds from business schools then investment banking, others have set up and sold their own startups, while others come from more corporate backgrounds. Many have previously been entrepreneurs and see it as a way to stay involved in the world of startups without setting up another business. It is also very common for VCs to have previously been angel investors, 'caught the bug' for investing in startups and decided to make it a more formal part of their career. ",

      "content": "Startups could find far worse sources of advice than UK 'scaleup' MADE.COM. MADE.COM launched in London with four founders in 2010. Six years later it has 160 employees and operates in seven countries, with a growth rate of 50 percent last year, according to cofounder Ning Li. The company has a simple pitch. It allows people to buy attractive, niche furniture online at much lower cost than usual as goods are sourced directly from the manufacturer, thus cutting out the middle man and a great deal of expense. It's an idea which Li says he originally devised. \"Initially when we first started, selling this sort of stuff online was pretty new. Today it's a given,\" he says. However it hasn't all been smooth sailing. From funding to expanding abroad, the team have had to take some significant risks. \"Companies like M&S have a lot of experience and expertise, yet when they tried to go to France they failed. It's certainly no easier for a smaller startup,\" Li says. Despite the risks, MADE.COM had a number of advantages: the fact it is online only, can pursue an agile 'test and see how it goes' strategy and has a diverse, international team, according to Li. It has now successfully broadened its reach from the UK to include Ireland, France, Italy, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. One of the main barriers to expansion abroad is not language but culture, in his view. However Li believes culture is becoming increasingly homogenised among the customers MADE.COM targets. \"We target an increasingly globalised population. People who shop on MADE.COM are urban, affluent professionals who use iPhones, go to Starbucks, Zara, use Facebook and so on. Taste and cultural behaviour are getting more similar across countries. It's great for us as it means we can sell the same products everywhere,\" he says. One issue MADE.COM has faced is the difficulty involved in 'scaling up' startups in Europe, especially compared to the US. \"VCs get a lot of value from scaling up a business rather than betting on another startup. Any successful startup has to scale up eventually,\" Li says. So why is 'scaling up' rarer in Europe than the US? It's mainly down to people and mindset, according to Li. \"In the US there's an ecosystem of companies that have grown rapidly and successfully and quickly become billion dollar businesses. People then leave a business - be it Uber, Facebook, Google - and set up their own businesses. \"In Europe we're bound more into hiring people with existing experience in the traditional retail industry. They're capable but they don't' have the growth mindset from tech startups or the scale which the US has,\" he says. Initially MADE.COM survived through a combination of the founders injecting their own funds (Li already set up and sold off one other startup called MyFab) and organic sales growth. After two years the team decided to seek external funding, partly to help pay for the costly and extensive marketing needed to successfully expand abroad. They got PS2.5 million in initial seed funding, Li says. Then, in 2012 they raised PS6 million in a Series B funding round from a combination of three sources: Level Equity, Maximus and PROfounders Capital, a venture capital firm which MADE.COM cofounder Brent Hoberman also chaired. The next and latest funding round in July 2015 raised PS38 million to help accelerate European growth. It was led by Paris-based VC fund Partech Ventures with Fidelity Investments (since renamed Eight Roads Ventures) and Level Equity also participating. Li is particularly positive about Partech. He says partner Bruno Cremel brought \"not just money to the table, but invaluable retail expertise.\" \"Plus we got on along well with them and that's important. It's like a marriage. You want to be able to spend time together and they need to be able to challenge decisions respectfully. They were real pros,\" he adds. The main purpose for raising these funds was to try to build a consumer brand, according to Li. \"It's quite hard to launch a consumer brand without investing significant sums into marketing. It was quite obvious when we did a business plan that we needed funding for that,\" he explains. However just because a startup needs cash does not mean they should negotiate away all their bargaining power: you should choose the investor as much as they choose you, Li advises. \"You have to choose a partner you are aligned with. A lot comes down to whether you think they will be on the same page, have a long-term view and an understanding of the business, rather than just an opportunistic investor looking to make a quick buck,\" he says.

      "content": "One of the biggest issues startups face is how to go from launch to a bigger, well-functioning business: also known as 'scaling up'. Difficulties tend to centre on hiring, funding and marketing but can go way beyond these concerns. A panel of experts came together last week to discuss the expansion challenges faced by startups at a London Technology Week seminar hosted by Tech City News. Representatives from the legal, finance, marketing, insurance and HR sector offered their various perspectives on how to scale up startups and provided a wide range of advice. Here are some of their tips... Many startups look for financing before they've divided up their capital amongst founders and employees. Adrian Rainey, partner at Taylor Wessing explains: \"When shared capital hasn't been sorted it can create tax risks for the founding group.\" Check that your company is not infringing on any other intellectual property and make sure it is secured within your own company. \"Do basic searches on things like trademarks. You will discover very quickly if you've found someone else's IP,\" says Ben Rose, insurance director at Digital Risks. \"Ensure IP is invested in your business.\" While things typically move rather quickly at the early stages of development, it is important to consider how decisions will impact the company's function in the future. \"Make sure the basics are right. Think about what you'll need two years down the line that you should have done at the start,\" advises Laurence Parry, tax partner at Kreston Reeves. While looking for new employees, it is important to hire people who will fit in and care about the company. \"It is so easy to just hire someone with the skills you need right now, but think about if they will take you where you want. There is research showing distinct diversity between people who are transactionally motivated and those emotionally in it who want the company to succeed,\" says Dr. Jill Miller, research adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. Make sure the brand represents the company in an accurate manner and reflects its goals. \"You've got to be out there talking about what the company does and why all the time. Really establish your brand. Not just the visual identity, but also the purpose,\" says Mary Ellen Dugan, CMO at WP Engine. \"It's important to get that vision of who are we, what we stand for and how we echo what we put out to clients on the internal side of things. We assume that everyone gets what's in our heads, but we need to be a little more formal and clear with our communication in order to get the right message out,\" says Miller. Experience is not the only thing an employer should be looking for. \"30 percent of the WP Engine workforce does not have a university degree. There's a whole range of technology skills that you need, not just one cookie cutter model,\" says Dugan. She continues: \"I had the opportunity to hire people that wanted to get into tech but didn't have the skills yet. You do need top notch expertise as well, but there's still a wide range. Every company is a technology company now. Be open to different skillsets.\" A clash between company interests and investor interests will create problems. \"It is absolutely as much about you choosing the investor as the investor choosing you,\" says Rainey. \"The founding partners and group need to be clear on why they want this investment to start with. Try to think of who matches you as an investor. For example, we didn't want any jobs to be cut after six months, so we picked someone we could identify with,\" says Miller. Integrated marketing strategies can work for different types of businesses from startups to large corporations. The use of different platforms including social media and advertising will be crucial to the success of a business. \"A company can't just do one lighting fast thing, as much as we want that to work. It's been said that a person needs to be 'touched' seven times in order to gain real recognition. Companies need to use this multi-faceted approach and it must be ongoing,\" advises Dugan. Miller explains: \"As a company gets bigger it becomes more difficult to speak to an owner. It can make employees feel like they don't matter when they don't see their bosses on a daily basis. We can't rely on conversations in the car park or at the water cooler anymore. It can be chaotic when the vision is no longer clear.\" She continues: \"The most energising and inspiring thing is when employee and employer understand each other.\" Outsourcing does not need to hinder a company's internal workforce. \"You don't want to stack employees if you can outsource efficiently. There needs to be a balance between the core team and the excellence and commitment of the business,\" says Rainey. Keeping employees engaged and happy is vital to the success of the business. \"It makes the point that we need to know what motivates us and then attract even more people like that into our business. Simple questions like what makes you want to get out of bed in the morning to what you look for in a workplace? Inspire and motivate people beyond the initial excitement. What keeps people engaged once excitement is gone?\" says Miller. It is important to think about networking on as large a scale as possible. \"Think about your network. Surround yourself with as much quality as you can. It will almost certainly open doors to investors along the way. How you bring in people from your network is so important. People/alumni are usually very generous with their time when you're first starting. If you're smart about it you can access not just your advisory group but also a fantastic circle of advisors around you,\" says Rainey. Not every employee and skill will be needed as the startup grows. \"The skills you need at the start of a startup are not necessarily the skills you'll need in two years. This is a difficult conversation to have and most businesses do need to have it. A lot of businesses delay that difficult conversation way too long,\" says Parry. Consider the differences that will affect the business in other countries. \"Be careful with tax. If you don't own 100 percent of subsidies you have to think carefully about that because a buyer will want all 100 percent. Find a way to deliver all of it,\" says Rainey. \"How you hold data and how you secure it will be different in other countries. It can be quite easy to be bullied into accepting contractual agreements with other countries as a startup. Make sure you are being careful and looking into obligations,\" says Rose. Tax breaks in the UK are some of the best internationally and can benefit most people involved with a business. \"The tax breaks in the UK are unbelievable. There are great share options, tax breaks for the investor and also tax efficiency around share plans for employees,\" says Rainey. \"There is a whole package of tax breaks that are UK specific and is not represented in any other tech industry in other countries. The US looks at this with huge admiration,\" he explains. The digital image needs to reflect the business as a whole since this will be the first impression for many people. \"The digital arena is the most cost effective. The beauty of digital is that size doesn't matter, whether it is two men in a garage or 100 people. Startups need to put confidence in their digital presence. It will showcase that your customers come first. Make sure digital presence is top notch and best in class,\" says Dugan. \"Constantly push out the message, what you're doing and how you present yourself. Showcase customers and showcase confidence. Show why you're a company people should pay attention to,\" she continues. ",

      "content": "The myth of the genius founder is rife in the technology sector. However, anyone that has seen David Fincher's The Social Network can tell you that even the very biggest and brightest tech startups will make mistakes. Tech startups are generally run by smart, young people that have a great idea but no experience of running a company. Recruitment, management, finance and legal issues can all be problems for entrepreneurs that don't learn from their mistakes quickly.  Here are just some of the mistakes that startups have made, from powerhouses like Uber, Tinder and Slack to fast-growing companies like Settled, Saberr and Laundrapp, and hopefully some advice on how to avoid them. \"Finding the right team is so, so crucial as an early stage startup. We're finding that you can't just buy the best in the market. We are in the position of finding people with the shared vision and aren't necessarily looking for the large pay packet, that's the number one thing. I'd sacrifice skill set for the attitude, but luckily we haven't had to. Seeing the Google culture was a big inspiration to me. - Gemma Young, co-founder of Settled and ex-Google employee Even Elon Musk told Business Insider his biggest mistake was: \"Weighing too much on someone's talent and not someone's personality,\" said Musk. \"I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.\" It's a cliche, but finding the right co-founder is like finding the perfect roommate. Who also happens to be really talented, ideally in an area that compliments your skill set. There is no shortage of advice on how to pick the right co-founder out there but Giles Andrews of P2P lending platform Zopa says that their founding team of five caused more than a few problems: \"There were too many of us. As a group we were way too homogenous. We didn't bring complimentary skills [...] If there is a right number it is probably two of you, maybe three, It certainly isn't five and I don't think it is one either. The best combination of founder teams is someone who is very technical and someone who has a flare for sales and marketing.\" Bertie Stephens, CEO of ecommerce platform Flubit, said: \"At the end of the day, it is essential to find a co-founder you respect and can get on with and who shares a common goal.  There will obviously be arguments along the way but ultimately you want someone who can roll with the punches, take constructive criticism in their stride and be flexible enough to change approach if things need adjusting.\" \"For a young company, every decision is a big one because you're working with a limited amount of money and resources. Entrepreneurs need to quickly become good at making tough P&L [profit and loss] decisions and deciding between things the company really needs to achieve its goals and things it would just be nice to have.\" - Aunkur Arya, Braintree \"This is my first real company, and I'm still very young [27], so the biggest challenge is to learn things you would normally learn, but then also immediately apply that for a whole business that I am solely responsible for. Which means we make mistakes, daily, and that's incredibly painful. \"It's an ongoing, constant making of mistakes and having to learn from them incredibly quickly. So it's exhausting from that perspective. Truth be told we have no idea what we're doing. We know how we want to get there, but we are learning every day.\" - Alistair Shepherd, founder of Saberr. His solution? Delegation. \"I surround myself with people that do know what they're doing in an area that I don't. I brought in an experienced CEO last year. I don't know how to build software, so I hire someone that can.\" - Alistair Shepherd, founder of Saberr Hiring, delegating and also outsourcing are all viable solutions to this problem, and startups could do a lot worse than working with other smart tech companies to fulfil business needs they can't or don't want to do in house. As Aunkur Arya at Braintree puts it: \"This is where startups need to take advantage of platform companies with expertise in the areas where they need it. Good examples include Parse, Stackmob, Twilio, Braintree, Harvest and many others.\" \"A common mistake entrepreneurs, especially those in the tech sector, make is getting too caught up in their vision of the future at the risk of losing touch with their customers. Going from a card-only payment system to one also accepting cash, might seem like taking a step back, but it was one we were more than happy to take once we realised the significant customer demand there was for this option. I firmly believe in the importance of listening to your customers and continuously innovating- even when it's not in the direction you anticipated. - Amer Hasan, CEO and founder of Minicabit \"My last piece of advice would be not to fear the unexpected. Successful entrepreneurs are separated from the rest by their ability to capitalise on unexpected opportunities that present themselves, sometimes at a moment's notice. Managing the demand for cabs during last year's tube strike in London, was intense and at times stressful but it also presented a great opportunity. We significantly increased our cab bookings, served many new customers and further enhanced the recognisability of our brand.\" - Founder of Minicabit, Amer Hasan  The highly popular instant messaging tool for business Slack only came about after the founder Stewart Butterfield failed at building a multiplayer game and pivoted into just the messaging element of the product. He told firstround.com: \"Never mind the part where we first tried to make a web-based massively multiplayer game and failed.\" If your startup has some early success it is important to not believe your own hype. \"The startup ecosystem has a vanity problem. Many entrepreneurs who raise money and attract the market's attention early find themselves the object of affection before they've made their first dollar. It's only partially their fault - the tech ecosystem can be an echochamber of praise for unproven ideas. This is why it's so important to stay humble. With rare exceptions, the most impactful companies were built by people who kept their head down and solved problems. Focus on building a meaningful product and business.\" - Aunkur Arya, GM of Mobile at Braintree \"It can be so consuming for a lot of founders when it shouldn't be. It's not the goal, the goal is to have resources and the best way is to sell your product. Of course funding is an objective when you don't have a product, and we were very lucky to get significant seed funding on basically a powerpoint and a good idea and a couple of case studies. That gave us the capital to build. VCs have objectives, it's not their cash and they are expecting to get a return and this puts a lot of constraints on you.\" - Alistair Shepherd - Saberr \"When we started in 2011, we wanted the company to grow naturally and without accumulating too much debt. That is why we decided to invest our own money into the company so we can truly focus on building the best product available without being distracted. Often startups prioritise raising money over searching for product market fit and building a user base. Those who do succeed in raising money are sometimes led to believe that they have a successful business.\" - Vinay Joosery, CEO of Severalnines. \"There is this brain washing propaganda that you have a startup, raise loads of money and that's the natural path. Going through an accelerator we were brainwashed into that. From experience I must say the next business I set up I will not raise money for as long as I can. There's a lot to be said for having complete control of your business. Once you have an investor, like it or not they partly run the business with you. A lot of the time if you have investor money you don't need to be profitable and do real, proper business stuff.\" Howard Kingston, CMO at Adludio The California Sunday Magazine's profile of Tinder founder Sean Rad is basically a lengthy example of mistakes to avoid, as it details Rad's chaotic initial exit as CEO of the startup. One passage reads: \"Some of the first members of the Tinder team say they feel jilted out of stock options. Others say that the issues in the office -- specifically around women -- were systemic.\" Rad became embroiled in a sexual harassment case between his co-founder Justin Mateen and former vice-president of marketing Whitney Wolfe. Rad has since returned to the company and the sexual harassment case with Wolfe was settled for a reported $2 million. Wolfe has since set up rival dating app Bumble. Rad told the magazine: \"People make mistakes every day.\" Uber CEO Travis Kalanick spoke at Dreamforce 2015 on the enviable challenge of adapting to high-speed growth: \"As an engineer it's about making stuff and you let the work speak for itself,\" he said. \"If you grow like we've grown then you're like a black box. You're not telling your story. You're showing by example. And actions speak louder than words.\" Kalanick has since taken the lead on a bold re-branding of the company, which was launched in February 2016. Firstround.com's interview with Slack founder Stewart Butterfield gets even more practical, it reads: \"Most importantly, getting the story out doesn't end when an article is published. In fact, by Butterfield's estimation, that's only about 20 percent of the recipe for media success. \"The other 80 percent is people posting about that article. I almost never go to news sites -- it's overwhelming how much content is out there. But I will pay attention to what my friends are picking up and sharing.\" \"The biggest challenge is definitely changing consumer habits. Trying to get people to change takes a long time, and I'm incredibly impatient. That's been probably the biggest personal challenge: to get people to understand what the hell we are doing\" \"I probably suffer from similar traits of other very creative, passionate and very frustrated and impatient entrepreneurs.\" - Ed Relf, CEO of Laundrapp. ",

      "content": "In a world where messaging app Snapchat could be valued at $20 billion (PS13.5 billion) the maths behind tech company valuations is as murky as ever. The reality is that valuing a tech startup is as much of an art as it is a science. Speaking as part of London Tech Week, former Bank of America Merrill Lynch technology analyst and now a consultant with his own company Oakhall Advisors, Andrew Griffin said: \"There is no right way to do valuations.\" Instead, \"it's what you can sell your business for.\" \"What you can do is take tried and trusted methods and triangulate them, and this is what investment bankers would do,\" says Griffin. Griffin laid out three preferred methods that investors and startups take when it comes to valuing a tech company as well as the pitfalls of each: Price earnings (PE):  Use broker/websites to find a consensus price earnings (PE) and earnings per share (EPS) growth among your peer group (say SaaS, fintech, analytics etc.), check if they have a similar cap structure, think about when you will be considered a mature business and what that implies about the investor's required return and if your business is loss-making then use the peer group to map your future profitability. \"The obvious problem with that is that, especially in tech, valuations change all of the time.\" Discounted cash flow (DCF): Run cash flow forecast scenarios for your business, ask investors what their required return is or what cost of capital they would assume, map the resulting value range and don't panic if it is wide, then check your long-term growth forecast with a compound growth analysis. \"The problem with DCF is you get a very wide valuation range and that it isn't absolute at all. There is just as much subjectivity as anything else.\" Return on investment based valuation: Griffin warned that this is a rare valuation technique in the technology sector but it is a useful sense check against more gaudy valuations. First you need to know the difference between your return on equity (RoE) and return on capital employed (ROCE). If you are a loss-making company look at expected future profit when mapped to invested capital, if you are reinvesting all surplus cash think about incremental return and if you are not reinvesting, what about dividends and buybacks? \"If you understand return on investment valuation you are going to attract the Warren Buffet type, long term, proper investors. The ones that really understand your business and won't be put off if the share price falls twenty percent or you go through an evaluation round that isn't as much as you hoped.\" Griffin warned against using the Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) metric when speaking to investors. The investor Charlie Munger famously stated: \"I think that, every time you see the word EBITDA, you should substitute the word 'bullshit' earnings.\" Griffin was a little more polite, saying: \"It's fine to use it but make sure you use other metrics too and be aware that investors will mark you down if you make a big deal about EBITDA.\" However, many startups, and even established tech companies like Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey's Square, are loss-making. So, how do you value a company that has no profits? \"The industry norm in the tech world is to use price to sales ratio to prepare a valuation,\" says Griffin. \"This is a really dumb way to value your business. If you are dealing with an investor who insists on, or accepts price to sales, just be aware that this guy has no idea what he is doing. Those guys are the ones that sell your shares the quickest when things go wrong.\"  So what do you? First off you need to have a good handle on where your revenues and profits are going, then you start running a set of scenarios. Griffin laid out a hypothetical scenario: \"So let's say you decide that your budget is to grow revenues 20 percent in the long run and keep your cost base growth at 10 percent so that you roll into profit by 2018.\" You take this profitability figure and multiply it by the price earnings ratio (PE) for your sector, say 20x for a fintech company, and then apply a discount rate to account for the risk. \"Ten years of chatting with investors in public markets shows me they will use between an 8-15 percent discount rate,\" says Griffin. He then ran this scenario for the loss-making company Square and derived a value of $7 billion, over double their current valuation of $3 billion. \"That might be optimistic but it gives you a start. Even for loss-making companies this forces you to think about your profit model not just your revenue model. I have seen loads of business models that underestimate the cost base.\" But Griffin does warn that: \"You want to scenario this to death [...] It is about understanding the levers of your valuation, because until someone buys shares you don't have one.\" Griffin spoke about the importance of getting into an investor mindset when it comes to valuing your business. Venture capitalists (VCs) tend to look for home run companies, an Uber or Facebook. They will gamble on a portfolio of startups with the hope that one gets them a double digit multiple on their investment. The risks of taking venture capital are well known but basically, as Nic Brisbourne of The Equity Kicker says: \"Venture capital is only appropriate for a small percentage of businesses that want to go loss making to grow very fast\".  There are alternatives to VC funding though. Griffin said: \"Angel investors probably want a 3-5x multiple. Get yourself on an incubator, get on high net worth groups, enter entrepreneur networks. If you are insistent on going down the VC route find a company they have invested in, befriend them and get them to introduce you. Do not pay anyone to introduce you to a VC, there is a really nasty market in paid for introductions.\" As a final tip to founders, Griffin put up an anonymised quote from the Financial Times from David Richards, the chief executive at WANDisco, a UK data storage company: \"I'd be lying to told you [sic] if we weren't frustrated, because our valuation is very different to our peers in the US,\" he said. \"But as long as we demonstrate traction with customers, the market will get it.\" Griffin called this \"a stupendous own goal, it's like ten own goals\" and said that startups should \"never discuss your valuation with investors or journalists\". Why? \"One: you are highlighting that you are undervalued. Two: in the most read investment newspaper daily. Three: investors think they are very clever and they are also sheep, so if they see a bunch of other investors thinking you are crap, then you are crap.\" \"[Investors might ask:] He actually doesn't understand valuation, and if he doesn't understand valuation then why would I trust him with my money?\" The final lesson when it comes to valuing your company is that all investors are different, so a responsible founder should have all of their bases covered. Griffin said: \"A lot of nonsense is spoken about valuation. There are lots of ways, do look at all of them because it helps you understand your business better and it means you will be able to communicate better with investors and maybe give you some more leverage when speaking to VCs.\" ",

      "content": "If there's one thing you can guarantee this year, it's that hype about the internet of things can only continue. Despite widespread mislabelling of non-IoT products as 'internet of things' (see here), the idea of connecting internet-enabled devices so they can relay information back to us, to cloud-based applications and to each other (device to device), has enormous potential. A growing number of startups are hoping to harness this emerging tech. From soil sensors for farmers to home heating, remote energy monitoring, clever car alarms to interactive museum exhibits or proximity advertising, there seems to be a near-endless supply of potential uses for the internet of things. Here are some of the most exciting UK companies operating in this space. Since launch in 2011 Evrythng has gone from a two-person operation to a multi-million pound firm working in three countries. The company has set up an 'IoT smart products Platform-as-a-Service that connects consumer products to the web and manages real-time data' - products being anything from cars to clothes, beer bottles or homes. nCube says it is the 'brain at the heart of your home'. It links together all your smart devices in one place, allowing you to control all of your home devices from one smartphone app. It is compatible with all devices and works offline, so you can remotely check any of your smart appliances from wherever you are. Product Health, set up in 2013, provides telemetry and alerts for batteries and solar home systems, allowing firms to find out how customers our using their battery, pre-empt when it needs upgrades or replacing, and so on. Using satellite technology and in-field sensors, KisanHub collects vast amounts of data farmers can use to boost efficiency and make better decisions. Combined, these sensors provide precise information on rainfall, irrigation, crop growth, wind speed, cloud cover and so on, all of which is displayed on dashboards. DevicePilot (previously known as 1248) is a consultancy startup launched in 2013 which focuses on IoT device management and scaling IoT projects up - all the way from small pilots to full deployment of millions of connected products. The team behind DevicePilot have played a significant role in developing open standards such as HyperCat for interoperability between IoT hubs. OpenTRV hopes to save energy by not heating rooms you are not in. Instead of using one thermostat for the whole house, it is designed to be simple to (retro-)fit to existing UK housing stock with radiator central heating. They are currently planning a trial run of devices. While technically no longer a startup since it was acquired by Huawei for PS17 million in 2014, Neul still merits inclusion as a pioneer in the IoT space, thanks to its cutting-edge work investigating 'narrow band cellular IoT' at its R&D centre in Cambridge. Cambridge startup seamless.li claims to offer 'the car alarm reinvented'. Users can log into an app to see where their car is. The app receives continual updates via a device plugged into the car. If something 'eventful' happens, say a burglary or fire, the company promise to let you know immediately. OpenSensors.io aims to provide a central, open platform for publishing and subscribing to real-time data streams generated by the internet of things. The firm promises to make it easier for people to connect, deploy and remotely manage large deployments of sensors and internet-connected devices, plus subscribe to and reuse publicly available real-time data. Blue Sense Networks makes iBeacon hardware and proximity applications. Their beacons use Bluetooth Low Energy and, combined with a smartphone, can be used to provide what they call 'proximity engagement solutions'. This includes personalised discounts and advertising in shops, interactive apps in museums tailored to the exhibit you are looking at, home automation products and 'smart signage'. Chirp.io says it allows you to 'sing information from one phone to another' and offers a way to share links using sound. Rather than pairing devices, as with bluetooth, for it to work you need to press a big yellow 'Chirp' button, and anyone running the app will 'hear' the data. Concirrus is firmly aimed at the B2B market: its cloud platform allows customers to gather and analyse IoT data with a view to improving their business processes. It was set up in 2012 by Andrew Yeoman (pictured) and Craig Hollingworth who were previously in the telematics and communications industries. Concirrus received a PS3 million cash injection last year from Imperial Innovations, which now holds a 28.6 percent stake in the company. ",

      "content": "If you rewind to late 2013 or early 2014, the market for enterprise startups, and perhaps especially for storage-centered startups, was quite different. Box raised $100 million in December of 2013 and $150 million the following July. Dropbox was on a similar tear, raising a $350 million Series C round in January of 2014 and snagging a $500 million debt facility that April. There was money dripping from the ceiling. And in the middle of all that, Egnyte raised a $29.5 million Series D in December of 2013. The company has not raised since. In the words of its amiable CEO, Vineet Jain, Egnyte does not \"need to raise money\" today, but it is considering it. In an interview, Jain detailed how that is the case and then dished on the current health of his company. Strap on your nerd helmets, friends. We're going 8-k spelunking. Early in our interview, Jain detailed a number of new performance metrics that he partially repeated in an article this morning.

Presumably, that is how Egnyte is so far from its last raise and still has money to spend. (Old joke: What do you call non-dilutive fundraising? Revenue.) But things are actually a bit better than that. Jain indicated that his company \"eked\" out a profit in the fourth quarter of 2016, inclusive of all costs (GAAP). The firm repeated the feat in the first quarter of 2017. Also, notably, the amount of free cash the firm generated in the first quarter of this year was in the seven figures. A company that doesn't lose money isn't precisely revolutionary. In fact, every business eventually has to make money or die. In the current technology cycle, however, it's uncommon for quickly growing companies to even generate cash, let alone GAAP profits. So how quickly is Egnyte growing? As you might expect, there is a tradeoff at play regarding Egnyte's profitability: The firm isn't growing as quickly as some other enterprise-facing startups that have recently gone public. According to Jain, Egnyte grew 38 percent in 2016 (the company's fiscal year matches the calendar year, praise Hetfield). The company also grew 30 percent in the first quarter of 2017, compared to the year-ago period. Those results are slower than the revenue tallies posted by Mulesoft and Alteryx, which put up greater than 70 percent and just under 60 percent revenue growth figures, respectively, in their S-1s. Yext recently went public with a trailing growth rate nearly equal to Egnyte's 2016 aggregate result. It is also not profitable. That means there's wiggle room to be had. Happily for Egnyte and other firms that are not growing above 50 percent, there is a rule of thumb that balances the tradeoff between growth and profits. It's called the Rule of 40. In short, add your profit margin and growth rate, and if they sum to 40 or more, you are doing well. Losing 10 percent but growing at 60 percent? Congrats, that's 50. Losing 30 percent but up 70 percent year-over-year? Not bad, 40! Growing at 25 percent and breakeven? Demerits. You are merely a 25 in a world of 40. Jain shared that his company \"continues to flirt with the Rule of 40.\" That puts its comparatively slower growth under a slightly more flattering light. I bring all this to underscore what \"good\" is for startups that are a bit more mature and past the days of hyper growth. It isn't hard to grow faster quickly when you are small, but after you reach eight figures of revenue, what is good performance? Rule of 40. Summing quickly, Egnyte raised small at the end of 2013 compared to competing companies, and it has since kept growing while reaching profitability sans external help. The company, according to Jain, might be willing to hit reverse on both, take on external capital, and, I presume, run deficits for a number of quarters to drive growth. \nRelated Articles\nEgnyte Connect lets business users access files wherever they live\nEgnyte announces deep partnership with Microsoft...at Dreamforce\nEgnyte pushes beyond storage into document protection\nAt the start of our time together, I mentioned that Egnyte now works in content governance. I did so as that service, what the company calls \"Egnyte Protect,\" is a new product for the firm. Protect, as Business Insider reported last year, \"is the first time that the company is selling a product that doesn't explicitly dovetail with the main Egnyte vision of providing storage that bridges a company's existing servers with the cloud.\" If it bolsters the company's growth rate remains an open question. Jain indicated a summer time frame for any potential raise. At the same time, given how long the company has stretched its prior infusion, I'm not exactly betting on the firm selling more of itself on the private markets. Following for Egnyte--with or without another private capital raise--is a shot at an IPO. Jain noted $100 million in GAAP revenue as the key threshold for that particular capstone. Let's see if the firm can get across the finish line still profitable. ",

      "content": "It is no secret how much tougher it has become over the last few years to raise VC dollars in the home services space. Even Rocket Internet's Helpling reportedly had to take a down round when it raised a further EUR10 million earlier this year. This can partly be explained by Amazon's interest in the home services market, and also because of high-profile failures, such as that experienced by Homejoy. But we're not quite done yet, with news that Nordic home cleaning startup Freska, which is headquartered in Finland but also operates in Norway, has picked up a modest EUR2 million in new funding. Leading the round is Sweden's Spintop Ventures, with participation from Norway's Momentum Partners. A number of individual investors also joined including Lasse Smedsvig and Harald Aalvik, founders of Adams Matkasse in Norway, and Olli Sirkia, co-founder of Finnish SaaS company Leaddesk. Freska also received public grants and loans from Finland's public innovation fund Tekes as a part of the financing. Meanwhile, I'm told the new capital will be used to acquire more customers in the Nordic region, including expanding to further cities and another country, and to further develop Freska's tech platform. In a call, Freska co-founder and CEO Sebastian Heinrichs declared the \"on-demand\" home cleaning market dead. That's because, he argues, it never actually existed. Instead, home cleaning is all about regularly scheduled and repeat business. \"[It's a] quality subscription play, not an on-demand play,\" he says. \"No player has or will ever show metrics that work for one-off cleanings you book for the same day 'on-demand'\". That's not to say that Freska doesn't offer one-off bookings -- it does -- but Heinrichs sees this element of the business as more marketing than profit. \"Today the metrics for one-offs work fine but we consider them as a marketing cost and more than 80 per cent of our monthly bookings come from subscribers\". The key to succeeding in what he says is a very competitive market is keeping both sides of the market happy, not merely matching supply and demand. \"The huge market opportunity hasn't disappeared, every home demands cleaning and the global market is growing every year,\" says Heinrichs in a statement. \"You need to understand the sensitivities of the market and stay laser focused on keeping the business fundamentals healthy. It's not enough to only create value for the consumer through easy booking, competitive prices etc. Unless you can be a company that your cleaners love as well, you'll face problems in scaling due to high cleaner churn and platform leakage\". To that end, retention of cleaners means ensuring that they have enough work local to them and are paid fairly, but also softer things like not feeling isolated and being part of a wider workplace community. This, says Heinrichs, has seen Freska run regular movie nights for its cleaners, for example. \"We have analyzed the market drivers and the players in the market and are impressed about how Freska has solved some of the hardest problems in this space,\" says Spintop Ventures' Finn Persson in a statement. \"Freska's team and numbers have undoubtedly demonstrated their ability to grow a \"soft\" business at scale without sacrificing on the customer experience and preserving a strong social angle that is important to us. We are excited to join the team\". Those numbers point to Freska targeting EUR10 million in revenue run rate by the end of this year. \"Despite scaling fast, our secret sauce produce the lowest cleaner and customer churn on the market,\" claims Heinrichs.

      "content": "Heap, a startup that promises a uniquely comprehensive approach to analytics, has raised $27 million in Series B funding. Co-founder and CEO Matin Movassate told me Heap's vision is to \"make data useful for everyone.\" Normally, according to Movassate (who previously worked as a product manager at Facebook), anyone who wants to ask an analytics-related question has to talk to an engineer about adding the right tracking code, then wait for the data to come in, then talk to an analyst to run queries on that data. Heap, on the other hand, is supposed to automatically record all user activity on a website or app, and to make it accessible on a self-serve basis. Movassate said it's also working to integrate other data sources and become \"the source of truth for your customer data.\" For example, by connecting data from your website and a payment system like Stripe, Heap can help companies understand what kinds of features are actually driving users to pay for subscriptions. Heap says it has more than 5,000 customers, including Zendesk, Lending Club and CrunchBase. The new funding was led by previous investors Menlo Ventures and NEA, with participation from Initialized Capital and Pear VC. Heap was previously incubated at Y Combinator and has now raised a total of $40 million. \nRelated Articles\nAnalytics company Heap raises $11M\nFacebook analytics gets smarter with Automated Insights and Custom Dashboards\nMixpanel Announces Codeless Mobile Analytics\n Looking ahead, Movassate said his goals include more hiring and more product development, allowing Heap to \"support more data types and larger volumes of data, so that our customers can focus on getting insights, not on all the plumbing and janitorial work of analytics.\" He also said that by continuing to invest in the product, Heap can stay ahead of \"the incumbents\" (Mixpanel, Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics). \"We have a really different philosophy, which has implications across our entire stack,\" he added. \"But at the end of the day, we never want to be complacent with our product.\" ",

      "content": "London based People.io has taken its first steps outside the UK, expanding its data sharing rewards platform into Germany -- where it's launched a co-branded version of the app with carrier o2 (called o2 Get), targeting the latter's ~24 million customers.The People.io app is also available to download via the App Store and Google Play, and o2 parent company Telefonica Germany will also be pushing the apps across its full market footprint of 44M customers. The telco link follows People.ioIn going through the telco's Wayra Germany accelerator last year. They say they're the first Wayra-backed startup to launch a co-branded product with Telefonica.\"By co-branding with o2 we benefit from a respected and well known consumer brand which... gives us a fast track to scale; meaning we can focus on creating a great product experience that delivers on our vision to give people ownership of their data,\" says co-founder Nicholas Oliver.\"Our decision to launch in Germany was driven by their strong, consumer-centric data privacy laws. This meant we were focussed on building a product that could meet even the most stringent data privacy laws with a view to further market expansion.\"Oliver says the team is expecting to get around 250,000 downloads in the next 6 months in Germany; increasing to just under 1 million by the end of the first year.The startup is apparently working with around a dozen telcos across 35 markets at this point -- although it remains to be seen how many of those conversations will turn into fully fledged co-branded app efforts.In o2 Germany's case, People.io's philosophy around user data ownership clearly meshes with a Telefonica strategic push to give data back to users aimed at fostering customer loyalty.We first covered People.io back in January 2016, when it had just launched a beta version in Shoreditch, giving locals the chance to share personal data in exchange for building up credits to redeem against digital services like streaming music. It's since scaled out to be UK wide.The core idea is to flip the notion that Internet users have to 'pay' to use 'free' products by having their personal data covertly and persistently harvested by these services. Instead, the platform aims to give people an incentive to share data willingly with it, for targeted ad purposes, rewarding them for sharing data with credits to redeem against different services (and by not sharing their data directly with others).The People.io app is broadly aimed at 18 to 25 year olds for now, offering a familiar Tinder-style swipe interface for them to respond to questions about their likes and dislikes to start inputting personal data into the platform. They can also choose to connect other data sources, such as their email account, in order to share more info -- with increased rewards for sharing more.Advertisers are able to target marketing messages at People.io users via the platform, but the startup says users' data is never shared directly with third parties. And the further pledge is that users can delete their account at any point -- which immediately and permanently erases all their data.Oliver describes the platform as \"a firewall for people\", and reckons Europe's incoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will have a serious impact on how the ad tech industry operates  regionally, because it gives consumers greater control over how their data is used. The GDPR is due to come into force in May 2018, and includes tough penalties for compliance failures, changing the risks associated with collecting and processing EU citizens' personal data.While People.io's initial product pays data sharers for viewing targeted ads -- typically redeemed against gift cards for Amazon, Starbucks and iTunes, according to Oliver, with an option to donate credits earned as cash to charity currently also in testing -- its wider vision is around expanding into paid services of its own; utilizing users' data to offer them the ability to pay to enhance other digital services they use, without having to lose control of their information.\"This might apply to health and fitness, connected home or even productivity apps and experiences,\" he explains. \"Our advertising feature(s) are really just phase one of a far bigger product vision. It provides us with a familiar consumer experience that allows us to develop the initial relationship with the user. From here, we can then educate them on the value associated to their data and demonstrate why taking ownership of it can benefit them; both financially and through enhanced digital experiences.\"A brief example could be with a Spotify playlist. Having a playlist that dynamically changes your upcoming tracks based on your current context (at work, at home, going running, trying to relax) or mood (stressed, energetic, feel like partying). With People.io -- we'd just tell Spotify 'Nic's at work' or 'Nic is about to go running' -- without sharing any of the data behind that insight. So that means Spotify can do what it does best, without ever needing access to your digital life.\"\"When you consider the future of Conversational interfaces, like Amazon Echo, or chat bots; this type of functionality will become increasingly relevant,\" he adds.At this still early stage, People.io has around 35,000 accounts activated since exiting beta in the UK, with around two-thirds of those characterized as 'monthly actives'.On average, Oliver says users engage with the app between two to three times a week. While the platform gets around half a million user interactions per month at this point.He says the startup is currently raising investment to support \"continued momentum and growth into other key markets\". Investors to date include Nick Robertson, founder of ASOS; Thomas Hoegh, founder of Lovefilm; and Founders' Factory, the accelerator founded by Brent Hoberman and backed by Guardian Media Group.European markets are a priority, thanks to the pro-privacy regulatory environment, but Oliver says the team is hoping to expand into the first non-EU market by the end of the year. \"The US is certainly a market that we're keeping an eye on,\" he adds.",

This time it's the turn of Greece-based VC fund VentureFriends, which is announcing the final closing of a EUR20 million fund to invest in Greek software and \"high tech\" startups at the seed stage. The two Partners of the fund are Apostolos Apostolakis and George Dimopoulos, with Stefanos Katsimpas also acting as a senior Associate.Over half the money was raised last year and I'm told VentureFriends has already done about 20 investments, but is keen to get the word out that Greek entrepreneurs have another investor to approach. Interestingly, unlike a lot of local European VCs, the firm's 40 or so LPs are all private. In other words, if I understand correctly, there is no tax-payer money being gambled here.Specifically, Apostolakis says the fund will be investing amounts between EUR250-500,000 and can follow on up to a total of 1 million. It is targeting startups with strong teams and generating a little revenue, with e-commerce/e-marketplaces, SaaS, AdTech, and on-demand services remaining a focus.\"We want to see network effects or high technology,\" he tells me. \"We look for innovating hustlers solving big and important need-to-solve problems\".In case you aren't familiar with Apostolakis' work, he previously co-founded e-shop.gr, the first e-tailer in Greece, and in 2011 he co-founded e-food, a food delivery marketplace acquired in 2015 by Delivery Hero, providing a major exit for the Greek startup ecosystem.He's also an active angel investor, including recently investing in Doctoranytime, the doctor booking app launched in Belgium by ex-Take Eat Easy team members.Notably, he and Dimopoulo were also among the first angel investors in Taxibeat, the taxi app that sold to Daimler in February.",

      "content": "The desire to create is a hard one to kill. I've had it all my life, from the comic books and music I made with my grade school friend Rick to the books I wrote and tried to write to the projects I built over the years. Now it's become easier and, in a way, harder, to make something meaningful online, so after shutting down one startup last year, I've decided to work on another one, Jaywalk, with a new team.My first startup was a deep learning experience. I learned about entrepreneurship firsthand, experienced the ups and downs (mostly downs) of building, raising and, ultimately, folding a company. I watched one friendship bend and another break under the unique pressures of dreaming something and watching the dream choke.It sucked.After all, I thought I was special. I've written about startups for a long time and I was flip and funny and ignorant of the pain people have to go through in order to make something real. Sure, I had an academic understanding of the topic  --  seed rounds, angels, development, media pushes  --  but I had no real idea what all that looked like in practice. I like to think that's changed and at the very least I've been given a more sober vision of the future.The tech media have made startups seem like a real blast. You hang with your friends, write a little code and cash a check. When you're young you can survive on ramen and heavy metal and you walk away unscathed, the hero of an action movie walking away from an exploding helicopter.But the truth is far more interesting. First the average and median age of most U.S. startup founders is 39. While we mostly hear of the young founder straddling the world, what you rarely hear about is the older founder with years under their belt with an idea that will change an industry that they understand implicitly. The best startup founders don't \"disrupt,\" per se. They improve. The byproduct of that aggregated improvement is disruption.Building things has also made me more compassionate. I used to run around the world yelling at people to quit their jobs, to get things done, to move fast and break things. No longer. I understand the value of a side hustle and the importance of research and planning. I also understand how rare startup success is and I try, in my own way, to assuage the grief of a new founder in a distant city who is finding out, as I did, that the world is cold and unfeeling and uninterested in your idea until, one morning, it isn't. It's the expectation of the breakthrough that has to sustain you through arguments, failures and deafening silence.I understand the dangers and benefits of VC, the pride that some people have at bootstrapping, and the importance of the entrepreneurial spirit in small towns and cities. I understand why this process is seen as a ticket out. When I visit different places and meet startup founders, I try to be nicer and more helpful rather than dismissive. I've finally taken to heart the old adage, \"Let us be kind to one another, for most of us are fighting a hard battle.\"I'm lucky that I've surrounded myself with smart people. Our latest startup, Jaywalk, brought me back together with my longtime college friend Rich, the guy with whom I worked on my first startup. We also have a solid team at an accelerator we joined in Boulder, Boomtown, and we're slowly building out our dev and UX team in order to create an app that truly rewards you for walking around and discovering new things in your neighborhood. It's something that's very dear to me for a few reasons, namely because it's almost impossible to get my kids to leave the house for a walk if I tell them we're going to the park but far easier if I tell them we'll get a cookie on the way back. We want to get people off their pocket computers and back into the world.I gave a talk about a year ago about how I felt after my first startup failed. It was called \"This is fine.\" I based it on that comic of the dog in the fiery coffee house. I focused on this quote:\"Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames.\"\n-- RumiThis quote really bothered me. It was some serious spiritual bullshit. In the doldrums of failure, I saw it as a warning: Set your life on fire and watch what happens, sucker. That's what I did. I quit a great full-time job, put my family at risk, broke bonds I had with people I loved. And Rumi is here telling me to light the pyre higher. You'll know your enemies by how they fan your flames is what I thought he was saying.I was wrong.I realized that this quote meant something entirely different. It meant that you had to find the right people to help you grow, to help you expand, to help you get the most out of your adventure. You had to find people to fan your flames. Those people helped you burn brighter, not burn up faster.I found those people in my family, in my friends, in my online community. I found those people in the folks at the accelerator who placed early bets on us and in the folks I built stuff with.I've spent the past two decades in my attic, writing. For me, building was always a solitary endeavor. Those friends helped me finally get out of my proverbial attic and I started building with others. And it's that effort, the effort of creating in concert, that truly defines us as a species. My friends didn't fan my flames to burn me out. They fanned them to help me light up the dark.This is a long way of saying I'm building something new. I'll keep you posted, and let me know if you need anything.",

      "content": "Huge companies in fast-changing, technology-intensive businesses buy startups. After all, they have the money and need fresh entrepreneurial talent to tap new markets and stay abreast of disruption.That's the collective wisdom about M&A in venture capital and startup circles. It's also how the venture business survives. Though IPOs may get more attention, acquisitions account for the vast majority of startup exits and a majority of venture returns.But what if the common wisdom isn't true? What if companies could do perfectly well adjusting to changing conditions, beating competitors and sustaining enormous market capitalizations without buying scrappy startups?To delve into that hypothesis, we used Crunchbase data to help assemble a list of the least acquisitive large-cap companies. The primary focus was technology companies, but we included other sectors because leaders in retail, consumer products, shipping and pretty much any other industry also invest heavily in tech.The resultant list shows that many companies with reputations as innovators actually don't do much M&A. Some did in the past, but have cut back or stopped in recent years. Others have never shown an appetite for acquisitions.Here are some of the most recognizable names on our list of big companies least likely to buy your startup.Netflix seems like the kind of company that would do a lot of acquiring. It has a valuation around $60 billion, an innovative, risk-taking corporate culture and investors who are comfortable with the company trading at a high multiple relative to earnings. Yet, according to Crunchbase data, the Los Gatos, Calif.-based streaming video giant has never bought a startup (at least not a disclosed purchase).While Netflix doesn't buy startups, it does have a history of spending generously on content and licensing deals. Earlier this month, the company struck its first licensing deal in China with the streaming platform iQIYI. It's also entered into licensing deals with a long list of Hollywood studios, including NBC Universal and others.Shares of the graphics chipmaker have been on a tear for the past year, and the company's market value recently surged past $60 billion.Yet the Silicon Valley company has only made one acquisition in the past six years, after a prior pace of about a deal a year. The last time it made a disclosed acquisition was 2015, and that was a tiny deal, paying $3.75 million to acquire seed-funded cloud gaming startup TransGaming.Between 2002 and 2011, Crunchbase shows Nvidia making about one acquisition a year, including some large deals. For its last big purchase, in 2011, the company bought Icera, a developer of mobile broadband modem technology, for $367 million.It's hard to make a case that not buying startups has been bad for Nvidia's competitiveness. The company posted a 50 percent revenue surge for the second straight quarter in its last earnings report. Its net income for the past year totaled nearly $1.7 billion.Texas Instruments is one of those companies that no one in Silicon Valley talks about. Perhaps that's because it's based in Dallas, has been around since the 1950s and has a brand famously associated with 1970s calculators. Nonetheless, Texas Instruments is a big player in the semiconductor space, with a valuation around $80 billion and profit of about $8 billion a year. It's also not very acquisitive these days.The last time Texas Instruments made a disclosed acquisition, according to Crunchbase data, was 2011, when it bought National Semiconductor for $6.5 billion. Maybe TI is still digesting that giant purchase. Before buying National Semiconductor, TI was reasonably acquisitive, buying about 10 companies from 2002 to 2011, including some venture-backed startups. But it hasn't been back to the table in a long time.Applied Materials is another company that used to do acquisitions fairly often but hasn't made a new one in years. Like Texas Instruments, Applied's last big acquisition was enormous. The company paid $4.9 billion in 2011 for Varian Semiconductor, a developer of semiconductor processing equipment. For a company with a market capitalization north of $40 billion, Applied has never been particularly acquisitive. But six years is a long dry spell.Although it hasn't been buying startups, Applied Materials has been investing in them. Its corporate VC arm, Applied Ventures, has participated in at least 46 funding rounds since 2006, including several in the past year.We all know Home Depot sells flooring, drills and other tools; therefore, it isn't expected to be snapping up quantum computing startups. But a lot of startup innovation happens in retail, as well, so one might expect a retailer valued at $180 billion to buy a few venture-backed companies to stay competitive.That hasn't been the case. According to Crunchbase, the last time Home Depot snagged a startup was five years ago. The hardware retail chain bought BlackLocus, an early-stage developer of pricing software that had previously raised a couple million dollars. The same year, it also bought Redbeacon, a site for getting price quotes and finding professionals to work on one's home.Other companies with massive valuations that aren't much into buying startups these days include UPS, Procter & Gamble and Citigroup. All have the financial resources for more M&A, just not the appetite.One conclusion to take away from track records of these non-acquisitive companies is that buying startups may be more a strategic preference than a necessity. It's obvious many large-cap tech companies -- Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Facebook, to name a few -- have a history of both acquiring a lot of startups and sustaining massive valuations. But clearly, that's not the only way to stay on top.",

      "content": "Naming companies is a daunting task, as anyone who does it for a living can attest. \"It's difficult to criticize a name,\" says S.B. Master, a Berkeley, Ca.-based founder who has launched two naming companies in her career, one of which is nearly 30 years old. \"From choosing a name, to getting a team to agree to it, to clearing that name from a trademark and URL and social media standpoint -- it's a pain.\" By \"triangulating around these difficulties, people end up someplace, which is better than no place,\" she adds sympathetically.Interestingly, the place where a growing number of startups seems to be landing is on a person's name that may have nothing to do with their business.This week, for example, a year-old, L.A.-based company called Dave raised $3 million for an app that predicts upcoming expenses and alerts users if their bank balance is low. Its founders say that people often ask friends or family for short-term loans to cover shortfalls; they want their customers to think of their startup as a pal who's also looking out for their best interests.Another company, U.K.-based Hibob (for \"Hi, Bob\"), raised $17.5 million in Series A funding this week for its cloud-based HR and benefits platform.Other companies have taken the same tack in recent years, including an app called Barry that lets users save full-length webpages, the tech-focused health insurance company Oscar and Clara, the virtual assistant company, whose name probably makes the most sense of the bunch, given that assistants have historically been actual people.Indeed, assigning tech startups human names dates back at least five years. Alex Friedman, president of Ruckus Marketing in New York, points to Casper, the mattress and bedding company whose brand evokes the friendly ghost who helps keep his friends safe while they sleep. There's also Harry's, the shaving gear company whose name evokes, of course, hair. And founders have named companies after themselves for as long as anyone can remember, in tech or otherwise. The online education company Lynda.com is named after co-founder Lynda Weinman. Philz Coffee is named after founder Phil Jaber.Still, assigning companies human names simply to make tech products more approachable is a  newer trend, and it's poised to escalate quickly in the age of artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, branding experts can't quite agree on whether it's an approach to emulate or avoid.For his part, Friedman doesn't think a company's name is nearly as big a deal as everything else that goes into supporting that brand. \"The name itself is not the brand,\" he says. \"It's an icon or component of what a company wants to build for itself, a focal point for how it's building its business. I say this a lot, but the name is a lot less important than the weight that many people give it.\"Whether it's Bob or Bill or Casper, he says, what's more important is \"what you're selling, who the customer is and how much money you have behind you. Without money, making a name mean something is difficult. If you don't have the capital, you won't get very far.\"The view runs contrary to that of David Placek, a Sausalito, Ca.-based naming expert whose iconic work was profiled years ago in The New Yorker, and who thinks names work best when there's a great story around them. He points to Tesla, named after inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist and futurist Nikola Tesla. \"It's an authentic association and it's elegant.\"\"Compare 'Tesla' to 'Dave' or 'Bob,' \" Placek says, pausing, trying to find something positive to say about the latter brands. \"Dave is the stronger idea; that 'v' has some energy to it. Bob seems a little informal for an HR function.\"If you were to ask us, we'd say to skip the trend and opt for something original. (Look, we still remember the sentient computer HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey. We also recall that things didn't go so well for the people in HAL's life.)Don't expect the fashion to fade away anytime soon, however. If there's a consistent trend, says Placek, it's that \"people try to replicate success.\" Because Harry's and Casper are seemingly performing well, other companies will naturally think it's worth a shot, too.The good news, says Master, the Berkeley-based pro, is that, \"in general, a bad name is not going to kill an intrinsically good product or company. The excellence of the offering can overcome many naming weaknesses. Unless it's unpronounceable. Or forgettable. Or you get sued. A lot of founders,\" she says, \"have overcome suboptimal names.\"",

After Pai's announcement, a group of more than 800 names in tech sent Pai a business-minded denouncement of his plans to strip away the rules that shape net neutrality.For tech companies that aren't telecom behemoths, the crux of the argument is this:\"... the success of America's startup ecosystem depends on more than improved broadband speeds. We also depend on an open Internet--including enforceable net neutrality rules that ensure big cable companies can't discriminate against people like us. We're deeply concerned with your intention to undo the existing legal framework.Without net neutrality, the incumbents who provide access to the Internet would be able to pick winners or losers in the market. They could impede traffic from our services in order to favor their own services or established competitors. Or they could impose new tolls on us, inhibiting consumer choice. Those actions directly impede an entrepreneur's ability to \"start a business, immediately reach a worldwide customer base, and disrupt an entire industry.\" Our companies should be able to compete with incumbents on the quality of our products and services, not our capacity to pay tolls to Internet access providers.\"The letter, spearheaded by Y Combinator, Techstars and Engine represents a massive swath of tech's net neutrality supporters, from investors and incubators to startups and code schools.

      "content": "Physical tracking in shops has been a global trend since at least 2013. Using a cell phone's location data and video monitoring, retailers have been tracking customers' movements through stores in an effort to regain some of the ground lost to the online retail experience.At least, that's the argument from stores. And now fast food restaurants are picking up the rallying cry.On the back of nearly 20,000 fast food locations using its customer-tracking technologies in stores, the Los Angeles-based startup Sense360 has raised $7 million in its first round of financing.The mobile-sensing technologies that are at the heart of Sense360's technology track location and survey data from customers to sell to fast food stores customer feedback (both voluntary and involuntary) on what's working and what's not working at locations around the country.Investors in the round included Firstmark, Qualcomm Ventures and Los Angeles-based Upfront Ventures.The company also established an advisory board with heavy hitters from fast food restaurants, like Joel Aach, a former vice president at Darden Restaurants (the company behind The Olive Garden restaurant chain and others); and Huw Griffiths, the global chief product officer at the marketing firm Universal McCann.Sense360 isn't the only company that's looking at customer behavior. BirdEye raised $25 million in February to not only analyze customer behavior and feedback but also to provide a sort of relationship management that the company said can help convert negative sentiment into positive experiences.Both companies are building on the foundation laid by other startups, like ShopperTrak, Retail Next, Nomi and Prism Skylabs.Aware of the pushback that has shuttered a number of location-tracking services in higher-end retail outlets, Sense360 chief executive Eli Portnoy takes pains to highlight the care with which Sense360 approaches customer data.\"We only work with apps that have a legitimate reason to collect location data and all participating apps must get user consent to acquire and share the location data,\" Portnoy wrote to me in an email. \"We also do not collect personally identifiable information. In fact, we intentionally obscure sensitive data like wifi access points so that we cannot access that information, ensuring added privacy.\"Portnoy said that the company never shares individual data with third parties, and that all reporting is provided in an aggregated format.That means Sense360 isn't sharing data, just access to the dashboard that allows restaurants to view the data that's been collected.",

Their system, which will be installed in delis and fast food restaurants, lets you refill your water bottle for free with filtered tap water that should, in theory, be better than the swill you currently get from water fountains.The founders, Jason Pessel, Andrew Betlyon, and Patrick Connorton, first worked on the idea during the 2015 Think Beyond Plastic accelerator but they've been lifelong friends. They bootstrapped the first few stations and won grants from NYU and the 2016 New York StartUp! Business Plan Competition.

The app shows where Reefill stations are hidden and you pay $1.99 a month for access.The system also maintains user data and can tell merchants and potential advertisers about popular places in the city. Finally, it keeps you from having to ask the folks behind the counter for free water. Pessel came up with the idea when he was walking through New York and couldn't find a single place to refill his reusable bottle. Out of this frustration a product was born.While it doesn't seem like much - a water fountain connected to an app, basically - Pessel notes that 50% of all bottled water comes from the tap anyway so this just cuts out the plastic-producing and, at $2 a bottle in New York, expensive middlemen.",

      "content": "Recharge, a two-year-old, San Francisco-based company whose app enables users to book a stay in a hotel for just 66 cents a minute, is opening in select New York hotels today, after testing its service over the last year in San Francisco.The company has also raised an undisclosed amount of funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, the corporate venture arm of airline JetBlue, which began providing seed funding to early-stage tech, travel and hospitality startups roughly a year ago.Recharge's earlier investors include Binary Capital, Floodgate, entrepreneur Rick Marini, Eniac VC, Expansion VC, investors Scott and Cyan Banister and early Google engineer Harry Cheung. They'd provided the company with $2.3 million in seed funding as of June of last year.Recharge is an interesting startup, one that we've half-kiddingly compared in the past with hotels that have long rented rooms by the hour for illicit activities. Given the caliber of the hotels with which it's partnering, however, it's seemingly time to rethink its place in the world. In New York, customers can now book rooms at The Pierre, W New York, The Knickerbocker and 1 Hotel Central. In San Francisco, it has struck partnerships with 15 properties, from the downtown Hilton hotel to the five-star hotel Taj Campton Place.According to co-founder and CEO Emmanuel Bamfo, Recharge, which has been used by at least 25,000 people to date, has several primary use cases. These include business travelers who may want to freshen up before heading into a meeting; families who might be doing some shopping and dining and need a place to relax; and local commuters who don't have the time or inclination to ride home between work and evening engagements.Recharge's partnership with JetBlue is purely financial for now, but Bamfo sees a day, too, when airlines use Recharge as a perk to offer for first-class travelers. You can imagine the business traveler whose flight is delayed being given a Recharge voucher, for example.According to the 10-person company, the average stay is two hours. Customers of its most expensive hotels pay $3 a minute for the service, money that it shares with the hotel. Bamfo says the revenue split depends on the day and the time of month. (Hotels are always trying to maximize RevPAR, or the revenue pulled in from each available room.)Bamfo also says that 75 percent of the people who've tried the service so far have used it more than once. \"We have a lot of recurrent customers who use it several times a week, and sometimes even more than once in the same day.\" The ultimate idea, he says, is \"to provide a bed, bath and shower at the right price point, no matter where you are in the world.\"For the company to truly scale, one might imagine that subscriptions would need to come into play. Imagine buying a package of, say, 10 hours to stay in hotels in San Francisco or New York to be used within a certain amount of time. Asked about them, Bamfo says there's high demand for such a product, and that subscriptions are likely coming.\"We see a lot of ways to [generate] incremental revenue,\" he says, including hotel subscriptions that include food, massages, even personal trainers. \"There a lot of things we could be, and will be, doing.\"Pictured above, left to right, co-founders Will Johnson, Emmanuel (\"Manny\") Bamfo and Chris Lo.",

In a statement posted to its Weibo account, Ofo said that it will work with Ant Financial, an Alibaba affiliate, on Internet and credit card payments and its international expansion plan.The amount of Ofo's new funding from Ant Financial was not disclosed. Just two months ago, Ofo closed a $450 million Series D that it claims raised its valuation to more than a billion dollars. That round was led by DST Global, Matrix China, CITIC, and Didi Chuxing, the largest car-hailing app in China.Ant Financial--the maker of Alipay, China's largest online payment platform--was already one of Ofo's strategic partners. In March, Ofo started using Ant Financial's credit-rating system, called Sesame Credit, to allow users with qualifying scores to rent bikes without having to make a deposit.Having Ant Financial as an ally strengthens Ofo's position against its chief rival Mobike. Both companies are eager to expand beyond China and have been busy lining up strategic partners and investors. Mobike's backers include Tencent, one of Alibaba's biggest competitors, and tech manufacturing giant Foxconn. Tencent makes WeChat Pay, which lags behind Alipay in market share but enjoys the advantage of being integrated into WeChat, the messaging app that is almost ubiquitous among Chinese smartphone users.In its statement, Ofo says it wants to be the world's largest bike rental platform and that it plans to work with Ant Financial to expand into new countries.

      "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/21/the-death-of-retail-is-greatly-exaggerated/",
      "content": "I've been thinking a lot about retail these days and I've been connecting the dots between the seeming death of retailers like Ralph Lauren and the book industry. In short, we are feeling the seismic echoes of the 2008 crash right now on Main Street and things are both ugly and pretty at the same time.The book industry, like the music industry, nearly imploded when the world stopped spending its disposable income in the last recession. This led to much doom and gloom and it also led to the rise of ebooks which, at the time, cost far less than a paperback or hardback. Therefore power readers, for lack of a better word, ditched bookstores and only those who enjoyed the book buying experience over the convenience of online kept going to bookstores. And, in seemingly an instant, we saw the collapse of Borders and Barnes & Noble and the death of print in America.Or did we?What we actually saw was a collapse of the old distribution models. Further, any time an old distribution model dies there are plenty of folks who complain their specific sky is falling. As a writer I watched magazines get replaced by websites and bookstores replaced by Amazon and publishers replaced by - and this could be good or bad - self publishing. The self publishing jag continued into Medium and, I would argue, most of the writing that once ended up moldering in the back pages of business journals and trade publications is now online. In short, all of the old distribution systems that made a few people lots and lots of money in the old days shut down and the new systems that made a lot of people a little money sprang up.At the same time we saw something amazing. First, paper book sales in general are up as Generation X and beyond begins to fight back against impermanence of culture. Book lovers know the old John Waters quote - \"We need to make books cool again. If you go home with somebody and they don't have books, don't fuck them\" - and they took it to heart. So you have indie bookstores \"booming\" in the same way long-tail blogs are booming and companies like Read Dog Books are offering cute little book boxes that makes receiving a book a treat rather than an exchange. People want paper books because of how they make them feel - special, in-the-know, educated. In short, it's the hipsterization of book retail.Back to the retail doldrums. While there are plenty of reasons malls are dying I would wager that the primary one is that they sell nothing that the average young person wants, especially given all of the choice on the Internet. The beloved brands of old - Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Gap - are stale and they were initially usurped by American Apparel and then fully shattered by upstarts like American Giant, Supreme, and the rest of that Massdrop/Acryonym/Facebook/RageOn world that brings custom fashion to you at a discount (or, in some cases, a decided non-discount). But the problem is that each of these highly sought-after and popular brands are available electronically and anyone - from a kid in Skopje to a tactical jacket lover in Fresno - has access to wacky fashion that was once available only to the New York/London/Paris/Tokyo crowd or the Griswolds in European Vacation.So again, as in the world of books, the long tail is eating the old and decrepit body. But the long tail again does something clever. The key, then, is for the startup to fill that niche with cool stuff that people want and that is available down the street and not around the world.What happens next? Exactly what is happening in books. The experience of clothes buying, the micro-retail experience of finding something only you know about, will become far more important. When everyone can get Yeezys online, finding a special pair of blaze orange ones made of carbon fiber and Japanese denim that are only available at a tiny shop in Denver will be the new driving force back to retail. Retail isn't dying, it's changing.Let the malls implode. Young retailers will remake them in their own image, gutting the old Gap stores and putting in a coffee shop. Large buildings will be repurposed into markets and micro-retail will replace maxi-retail. And the process will repeat - small becomes big which topples and the small rise again. While the seismic effects of retail death are real and dangerous in the short term I'm optimistic enough to bet on the small scale in the long term.And, maybe in the next ten years, someone like John Waters will tell the world that if you go home with someone who doesn't own a one-of-a-kind, wildly unique P24 HD Gabardine Articulated re-cut staple military style trouser you shouldn't sleep with them.",

      "content": "This is going to be a lot of fun. MIXhalo was founded by Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger and the startup is set to reveal its first product at Disrupt NY 2017. And Mike is bringing some other famous friends to help.MIXhalo has developed a way to distribute audio to a crowd -- like at a concert -- in a way, they say, is even better than what the musicians hear on stage. And there seem to be significant broader applications for the tech, too.Founder Mike Einziger enlisted the help of Pharrell Williams (a MIXhalo advisor & investor) to show off what the company has developed in special presentation at Disrupt NY. They are set to take the main Disrupt stage at the close of the show, just prior to when we announce the winner of Startup Battlefield. And yes, they will be performing a special musical performance for the audience.The event is open to all Disrupt attendees and it will be streamed live like the rest of the conference. But only those at the venue will be able to experience the MIXhalo technology firsthand.So, obviously, we're thrilled to have MIXhalo at the show.Since the first Disrupt, TechCrunch has strived to showcase startups upending traditional paradigms. This is mostly done through chats on the stage and Startup Battlefield, where a couple dozen startups compete each Disrupt for $50,000 and loads of press. Occasionally, a startup like MIXhalo comes along that is showcased best in a different format.Viv was no different. Founded by Dag Kittlaus, who also founded the company that developed Siri, the startup launched with a demo at Disrupt NY 2016 and was acquired by Samsung later in the year.MIXhalo joins a full agenda for Disrupt NY 2017. From the NYT's Mike Thompson to Facebook's Fidji Simo to New York's own Derek Jeter, the three-day show is packed.Registered Disrupt attendees will receive more information about this demo during the conference.General admission tickets and exhibit packages are still available for purchase.

Sure, Canada may tower over the United States in physical size, but many countries of similar stature -- G7 nations, for example -- dismiss the Great White North as nothing more than America's top hat.This is a mistake.Canada, with nine percent of the world's forests, is a land of plenty. As well as an enviable array of natural resources, Canada also boasts incredible support for entrepreneurs, both homegrown and international. Many household names, such as Slack, Hootsuite and Shopify -- which may be mistakenly considered as U.S. products -- hail from north of the border. This proves Canada is capable of delivering on startup success.And it's no surprise that startups excel in the country. Sure, there is less access to VC funding and the persuasive call of Canada's southern neighbor, but the Canadian government is working hard to build and keep successful startup ecosystems. There is a huge selection of government aid available to small businesses, some of which includes grants that don't have to be paid back.Alongside substantial government backing is Canada's array of world-class universities. The University of Waterloo -- increasingly known as Canada's answer to MIT -- sees incredible numbers go to Silicon Valley every year, while others all over the country produce thousands of talented grads.While eventually losing out to Colombia, Canada was shortlisted as country of the year by The Economist in 2016. The United States' northern neighbor boasts world-class universities and resources to develop talent and, currently, the Canadian dollar is 0.75 cents to the American dollar. This means a highly educated workforce is available for less capital for entrepreneurs all over the world who are ready and willing to make the leap to Canada.Canada has a proud history of technological innovation. Communications company Nortel pushed expansion in the 1970s, bringing talented telecom engineers. In 1983, after a wave of deregulation, Nortel gave way to Bell Canada Enterprise (BCE), which signaled an era of telecom preeminence.If that weren't enough, a year later, in 1984, Research in Motion (RIM), which today is better known as BlackBerry, was founded. While the sun may have set on BlackBerry, the impact of their phones -- and the eponymous messaging service -- has left a lasting impact on cellular phone technology.Fast-forward to the nineties and the Canadian government expanded its Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax incentive program to allow for assistance to companies performing research and development. The legacy of this decision is clearly illustrated by Canada's fervent support of startups in recent times.Since the turn of the new millennium, Canada has been determined to churn out initiative after initiative to support new business. The opening of the MaRS Discovery District in 2005 -- a 1.5-million-square-foot complex located in Toronto's downtown -- provided entrepreneurs with skills via its venture program, and included a network of 1,000 high-potential-growth startups that collectively generated more than $1.3 billion in revenue from 2008-2015. Just two years later, Maple Leaf Angels set up shop in the city center, with a focus on investing in early-stage companies.The MaRS Discovery District in Toronto. Photo courtesy of the MaRS Discovery District.Universities across the country have worked to provide space and support for startups to grow, too. In 2010, Ryerson University founded the Digital Media Zone (DMZ), a combined incubator/accelerator program that has assisted more than 130 companies.In later years, a wave of funding opportunities and globally recognized accelerator programs took root across Canada. The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) deployed $180 million in early-stage startups between 2011 and 2014, while BDC Capital launched its IT Venture Fund II, a fund worth $150 million. 2014 saw U.S. heavyweight The Founder Institute, founded by Adeo Ressi and Jonathan Greechen, open its first Canadian branch. In March 2016, 500 Startups announced its $30 million Canada fund.With such a strong foundation of startup initiatives and technology success, it's no wonder that Canada is in such a strong position now.Despite a population of just 2.8 million, Toronto has been named the most diverse city in the world. About half of its residents were born outside of Canada, and the city is home to 230 nationalities. As Canada's largest city, it's quite naturally the country's commercial, industrial and financial center. It stands to reason that this would make Toronto stand out as the country's biggest tech hub, too.As an example, Toronto-born FreshBooks, an accounting platform for small businesses, has more than 10 million users, and a 43,000-square-foot office in the city, which houses 245 employees. Self-publishing company Wattpad, which lets writers share their work on the platform, has 45 million users worldwide. In November, the company signed a deal with Universal Cable Productions -- the creator of Suits -- with the idea to sift through the stories online to turn the popular ones into TV shows. On-demand platform AskforTask has more than 150,000 taskers, and has doubled its business each year since launching in 2012.The aforementioned MaRS Discovery District is a tower of strength in the city's startup community, too. The four-story brick building takes up almost one city block, and is one of the world's largest innovation hubs, offering funding, mentorship and facilities to the city's creators. Ryerson University's Digital Media Zone incubator is also a resource for early-stage companies worldwide, as are a range of University of Toronto incubators and accelerators. BetaKit, a news publication led by Douglas Soltys that documents Canadian startup news, is also based in the city.As Canada's financial hub, Toronto is home to much of the country's investment. OMERS Ventures has had arguably one of the biggest impacts on the Canadian startup scene. The VC firm backs startups directly, including Shopify, of which the firm owns six percent. Canada also boasts the Venture Capital Action Plan (VCAP) to encourage more Canadian private investors. For every $2 in funding, the government gives another $1 to early-stage companies.Other financial support includes 500 Startup's Canadian fund; the Scientific Research and Experimental Development Program, a federal tax incentive for companies conducting research; and the Industrial Research Assistance Program, which provides entrepreneurs with funding and advisory services to help them develop technology.500 Startups partner Sanjay Singhal.

While there are up to 4,100 active startups in the city, none are valued at over a billion dollars, and aren't necessarily household names outside the tech scene.Just 60 miles west of Toronto, however, is Waterloo, a small city of 134,000 residents, which holds much of Canada's tech talent. Like San Francisco and the Bay Area, Toronto and Waterloo form a corridor of startup innovation between them. Yet, while Toronto is yet to see any businesses hit that magical unicorn status, Waterloo has.Waterloo is the home of telecoms giant BlackBerry, as well as newer companies that include video optimization platform Vidyard -- which last year raised $35 million in Series C funding -- and Bridgit, a communication app for construction teams that won Google Demo Day: Women's Edition in 2015. Similarly, Shopify, considered one of the country's most successful startups, has an office in Waterloo (as well as offices in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and San Francisco).Waterloo boasts the MIT of Canada -- the University of Waterloo -- which sends talent to startup ecosystems. In fact, every year, recruiters from Apple, Google and Facebook, among others, flock to this Canadian tech hub to onboard new employees; graduates of the University of Waterloo are the second-most-frequently hired in Silicon Valley after students from University of California, Berkeley. The university's students are famously inventive, too. In 2009, Kik Interactive was founded by a group of students who wished to create new technologies for use on mobile smartphones; it has gone on to become an incredible success.The Toronto and Waterloo corridor is sometimes billed -- unsurprisingly -- as the Silicon Valley of the North. Toronto mayor John Tory has said that the Toronto-Waterloo corridor has all the elements for huge success, much of which comes from the quality of universities in the area. The University of Waterloo ranks 24th in the world for computer science and information systems, and the University of Toronto -- one of Canada's most prestigious schools -- ranks 16th.While many tech giants already have a presence in these cities, there are efforts underway to make Toronto-Waterloo rise to the top of the world's tech scene. Following the release of the City of Toronto's Startup Eco-system Strategy in 2015, the city launched StartUp HERE Toronto, a website built and managed by startup influencers to feature startup news and events and put a spotlight on entrepreneurs in the Toronto-Waterloo corridor.Other notable leaders in the region include Sanjay Singhal, partner at 500 Startups; David Crow, advisor at Venture for Canada; Mike McDerment, CEO at FreshBooks; David Ossip, CEO at Ceridian; Matt Golden, founder at Golden Venture Partners; Marcus Daniels, CEO at HIGHLINE vc; Mark Organ, CEO at Influitive; Salim Teja, executive vice president of Ventures at MaRS Discovery District; Lauren Robinson, COO at Highline BETA; Neha Khera, partner at 500 Startups; Heather Payne, CEO at HackerYou; Saadia Muzaffar, founder at TechGirls Canada; Eva Lau, co-founder at Two Small Fish Ventures; Carol Leaman, CEO at Axonify; and Janet Bannister, general partner at Real Ventures.Vancouver is found in British Columbia (BC), amongst the mountains on Canada's west coast. With a population that just exceeds 600,000, the city's easygoing vibe makes it one of the most attractive places in Canada. In fact, Vancouver is rated the fifth city for quality of life in the world by Mercer, the only North American city to make the list.Vancouver residents aren't shy about being in the greenest, and arguably most beautiful, city in Canada. They're also getting pretty good at representing their rising tech scene. The entire province of BC now boasts more than 100,000 people working in the tech sector. Employment in the industry rose 2.9 percent in 2016, compared to the national tech sector's growth at 1.1 percent. Tech in BC employs more people than the mining, oil, gas and forestry industries -- combined.Boasting mountains and ocean just like Silicon Valley, Vancouver also has seen some of the biggest Canadian acquisitions. Vancouver's PlentyofFish, the popular dating website, was purchased by Match Group in 2015 for US$575 million, for example. Even more, Vancouver is home to OMER Ventures-backed Hootsuite -- which is valued at US$1 billion -- as well as everyone's favorite, Slack. Although Slack the company is technically based in San Francisco, CEO Stewart Butterfield also works out of Vancouver, or Vancity as it's often called.In the hopes of fostering more unicorns like Slack and PlentyofFish and fastening BC's startup scene on the world map, the provincial government set up a $100 million fund for early-stage funding in December 2015. Since then, there have been about 14,000 new tech jobs in the province. Also located in Vancouver is the BC Tech Association. Founded in 1993, BC Tech provides growth, talent and advocacy programs to tech companies in the province.Being on the west coast, and therefore the same coast as startup hubs in San Francisco, has its advantages. Startups in the city attract a lot of outside attention, including from Silicon Valley stalwarts. In February of this year, Vancouver-based TIO Networks, which offers online and mobile solutions for bill payments, and processed more than US$7 billion in fiscal 2016, was acquired by PayPal for $304 million. Similarly, Kickstarter opened its first office outside of the United States in the same month, after acquiring Vancouver-based startup Huzza.Traction Conference, hosted by Launch Academy and Boast Capital, is one of a number of popular conferences in the city, and, according to BetaKit's Jessica Galang, puts an emphasis on helping startups learn actionable ways to accelerate their businesses. Cube Business Media, led by Mark Stephenson and Dave Tyldesley, is another organization hosting events throughout the city.Like Toronto and Waterloo, Vancouver boasts world-class universities, such as the University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University. SFU Innovates is a program from the latter, which seeks to build and support innovation and entrepreneurship across the university. It has so far contributed $1.3 billion to BC's economy. Similarly, UBC's Startup Weekend event inspires would-be founders to get set up within 54 hours in a do-or-die race to success.Said investor Ali Saheli of 7 Gate Ventures over the phone, \"Vancouver allows founders to remove all of the noise that you would get from the Valley and to focus on building products. In the past couple of years the number of early-stage startups has significantly grown thanks to government grants and communities such as Launch Academy and The Next Big Thing.\"Additional notable leaders in the city include investors Boris Wertz and Markus Frind, entrepreneurs Stephen Ufford of Trulioo, Ali Davar of Qudos, Ray Walia of Launch Academy, Carol Newell, founding investor and principal at Renewal Partners and Shahrzad Rafati, CEO at BroadbandTV. Additional startups and events are well-documented by Alex Chuang of Launch Academy on TechCrunch here.One of North America's most European cities, Montreal, Quebec, is also the second-largest primarily French-speaking city in the world, just after Paris. The city has an undeniable allure -- with tons of public art displays, miles of bike lanes and world-class festivals, such as Festival International de Jazz de Montreal, as well as Startupfest.Although Montreal may host a less mature ecosystem when compared to other cities, it boasts world-class universities, including McGill University and Universite de Montreal, and a host of government programs. Additionally, Montreal is home to almost 50 percent of all Startup Weekends in Canada, training close to 1,000 entrepreneurs a year.\"Local government provides the best programs in North America with millions of dollars in grants, loans, innovation tax credits, and even government backed incubators without any cost to the entrepreneurs,\" said Montreal Founder Institute Director Sergio Escobar over the phone. \"As any emerging ecosystem, Montreal has many challenges. Among them, Montreal counts very few seed-stage investors and no pre-seed ones. Many times, seed investors tend to function closer to Series A investors with non-friendly term sheets and low valuations.\"The Founder Institute team in Montreal. Photo by Charles Laberge, Collaboration Speciale, La Presse, 3 September 2015.Startupfest is a three-day festival that takes place in a relaxed \"Tent Village.\" It features keynote speakers, how-to sessions and $200,000 investment opportunities from festival angel investors. Even more, the festival features a panel of infamously tough Grandmothers, to whom entrepreneurs pitch their startups.While the city is considered the cultural capital of Canada, Montreal is also an artificial intelligence stronghold. Just in January, Microsoft announced it would double its investment to AI research and development in the city. Over a five-year period, the tech giant will gift $6 million to the Universite de Montreal, and $1 million to McGill University.A week before this announcement, Microsoft acquired natural language processing and AI startup Maluuba, which was founded by Waterloo graduates Kaheer Suleman and Sam Pasupalak in 2011. In February 2016, it also bought Groove, a Montreal music app that uses machine learning to come up with personalized playlists.In terms of resources for entrepreneurs in Montreal, FounderFuel is an accelerator funded by Real Ventures, a Canadian VC firm. Entrepreneurs Anonymous is a peer-to-peer support group, which takes place at a different Montreal bar each month.Notable leaders in Montreal's ecosystem include John Stokes, general partner at Real Ventures; Sergio Escobar, managing director at the Founder Institute Montreal; LP Maurice, co-founder and CEO at Busbud; Chris Arsenault, partner at iNovia Capital; Mike Cegelski and Francois Gilbert of Anges Quebec; Alan MacIntosh, partner at Real Ventures; Daniel Robichaud, CEO at PasswordBox; Helge Seetzen of TandemLaunch; Beatrice Couture, general manager at InnoCite; and Emma Williams, director at Maison Notman House.The three most popular cities in Canada do not exclusively dominate the startup ecosystem. There are flickers -- and sometimes flares -- of startup activity that certainly have the potential to grow larger in the coming years.Canada's capital, Ottawa, sits on the border with Quebec, and is just about two hours from the city of Montreal. Parliament Hill is the city's main attraction -- and depending on the season, visitors and residents alike skate on the Rideau Canal, which winds for five miles throughout the city.Ottawa is home to Canadian unicorn Shopify, and has been on a kick to make itself the best city in Canada to start a business. Ottawa-based SaaS accelerator L-SPARK, which is directed by Leo Lax, supports talent in the city and also hosts SAAS North, a conference that helps Canadian companies network and promotes Ottawa as the country's capital of SAAS.\"In Ottawa there is a wealth of experienced C-level executives from the telecommunications industry, and as that industry has slowed down it has created an enormous talent pool for startups,\" said Leo Lax over the phone. \"We can shortcut the challenges of building a SAAS company through the experience of the people here.\" Further support in Ottawa includes Invest Ottawa, a group that delivers economic development programs to give entrepreneurs a head start in Canada's capital.The SAAS North team in Ottawa. Photo by Velour Productions.Other notable leaders in Ottawa's ecosystem include Tobi Lutke, CEO of Shopify; Allan Wille, CEO at Klipfolio, Terry Matthews, chairman of Wesley Clover International; Jamie Petten, co-founder of SAAS North; Craig Fitzpatrick, CEO of PageCloud; Adrian Salamunovic and Nazim Ahmed of Canvas Pop; investor Aydin Mirzaee; Victoria Lennox, co-founder and CEO of Startup Canada; and Haidee Thanda, founder of Hacking Health Ottawa.Another city to consider is Edmonton, which is also beginning to carve out a place on the map in the country's startup scene. The city's hubs include incubator TEC Edmonton -- a joint University of Alberta and City of Edmonton initiative ranked the world's 16th best business incubator - Business Link, as well as Startup Edmonton. For the past two years Startup Edmonton has hosted Edmonton Startup Week, which features more than 20 community events for entrepreneurs across the city.Lastly, Labrador and Newfoundland, which are the most eastern point of North America, are beginning to develop grassroots startup communities. This includes StartupNL, a community of entrepreneurs led by Will Gough, Jason Janes and Roger Power that hosts events and programs. In 2014, the government of Newfoundland and Labrador unveiled a $15 million fund to invest in local entrepreneurs and startups, and in 2016, three St. John's, Newfoundland startups announced funding of more than $2 million, including game developer Clockwork Fox Studios, marketing collaboration platform HeyOrca and software provider Sentinel Alert.Canada's ecosystem is still in its early stages. Companies tend to exit too early rather than focusing on growing something sustainable. It often feels like Canadians bow out where Americans -- for whatever reason -- might not. Similarly, sub-zero temperatures scare people to warmer areas, leading to a brain drain and serious demand for startup-orientated marketers. Many current marketing staff are not au fait with startup performance, due to their backgrounds in more traditional industries.Canadian investors have historically looked at minerals and mining companies, which attract much of the capital. People tend to invest in other industries rather than startups because of their prior experience.On the other hand, Canada provides affordable development talent, and thousands of people graduate each year from some of the best universities in the world. Founders are now beginning to enter the startup market again after their first exits, and there is a growing sense of community. In recent years there has been impressive growth in the number of people interested in startups. Government tax incentives reward companies for investing in research and development.Then there is the Trump question. The new U.S. administration's hard stance against immigrants can only play into Canada's favor -- with worldwide talent flocking to the Great White North, the opportunity is Canada's to lose. Over the last five years, Canada has brought in more than 800,000 immigrants to fill holes in the jobs market. With an unfriendly U.S. approach to immigration, international talent could easily look to Canada instead of America as a land of hope and opportunity.With 20 percent of Canada's population already born elsewhere, the country now offers a startup visa to encourage international entrepreneurs to immigrate, with permanent residence status. This is crucial to Canada's future success. By 2019, there will be 182,000 tech jobs up for grabs and nowhere near enough people to fill them. So while Canada's tech scene is growing, there is yet more to come.There are a lot of bright things to come for Canada's startup scene.",

      "content": "Early stage VC firm Nauta Capital, which has offices in London, UK, Barcelona, Spain and Boston in the US, has closed out a 2016 fund raising -- capping it off at $170 million.The firm has already closed eight investments with this fund, which had a first closing at $70M, with a further $100M added in parallel -- now closing oversubscribed vs the original target for the fund of around $120M, according to general partner Carles Ferrer. (Its prior funds were $55M raised in 2006, and $115M in 2010.)Nauta has a focus on what it describes as \"capital-efficient Series A software propositions\": aka startups that take a leaner approach to taking on funding vs money-gobbling wannabe unicorns. Its areas of tech interest include b2b software, digital media and \"enabling technologies\" for mobile and the Internet -- with an overall focus on large markets with \"limited previous technology impact\".\"We believe the VC model has been lately too centered around the Unicorn concept, that is too many times return-unrelated,\" Ferrer tells TechCrunch. \"Too many companies are pushed to grow more and more but too early, and for that, raise too much money, again too early. Many of them don't have enough evidence from the market to know if they should be spending so much money.\"If it happens to be too early, that company may end up wasting so much money and energy and having a conflict between equity raised, valuation, and its performance. This too often results in good companies that are actually severely damaged by a poor funding strategies.\"Ferrer argues that the risk for startups raising too much too soon can be especially \"delicate\" in the b2b sector -- describing the firm's philosophy for startups here being \"lean for a good while is beautiful\".\"Once you have enough proof, then it is time to run, but not before. By being lean you maximise chances to obtain premium multiples for yourself and entrepreneurs, at any exit valuation. Too many companies cannot make good money for their investors unless they become a semi or full unicorn and we think this is wrong,\" he adds.Staying away from risky unicorn bets is also pragmatic, given falling startup valuations and the clutch of down rounds in recent years. Albeit, investors in Europe do typically ask to see a clearer path to monetization earlier vs their Silicon Valley counterparts.The 40+ startups in Nauta's portfolio thus far include companies like Brandwatch, Fizzback, GreatCall, Eyeview Digital, Scytl, Basekit, ForceManager, Marfeel, Getapp, Privalia (which exited to Vente-Privee last year) and Social Point (which exited to Take-Two earlier this year).While the investments the firm has made most recently, with the 2016 fund, are: in the UK and Ireland: CloudIQ, BeMyEye and ChannelSight; in Spain: Nextail, Geoblink and Lodgify, and in the Boston area: Content Raven and Connected2Fiber.It says it plans to invest in around 25 companies in total with the fund -- mostly at Series A level, though Ferrer notes there \"may be a reduced number of earlier deals (A minus) when we know very well the entrepreneur\". He says the firm typically invests between $1M and $7M per startup, but describes \"the sweetspot\" as \"usually as a first ticket $1M to $3M\".What makes a team catch the firm's eye? Responding on this he describes its investment thesis as \"very disciplined\", saying: \"We only do what we understand very well and try to stick to it. Capital efficiency is a concept our entrepreneurs believe in also very passionately.\"Overall, he says the approach is to look for industries that have not been disrupted and then pick \"the best companies to do it\", citing a couple of startups it's backed (InCrowd, BeMyEye) that are aiming to disrupt the \"huge and inefficient market research industry\", for example.In terms of geographical spread, Nauta has full investment teams in its three locations, and Ferrer says from London it's able to cover the whole of the UK and Ireland plus \"other continental European countries where companies are born and naturally migrate to London as a hub\"; likewise covering Spain and Portugal -- and looking further north into Europe -- from its Barcelona base.\"We look at other geographies in Europe when companies migrate to our hubs, or have a special interest on our geographies (where we have a team). Eventually, we can learn enough from those geographies to probably in the future invest more actively there too. We think it is so important to have an investment team based where the dealflow is originated. We also have a Boston presence where we cover the east coast and also help European companies migrate,\" he adds.Nauta's current fund has been backed by a group of international investors, based in the UK, Continental Europe, Latin America and China, which it says include leading Institutions (Fund of Funds, Financial Institutions, Insurance Companies, Endowments and government agencies) and large Family Offices.Photo: From left to right, general partners Jordi Vinas, Dominic Endicott, Carles Ferrer and Daniel Sanchez",

      "content": "Zozi, the drama-filled travel industry startup whose former CEO recently sued its board, has been acquired by Peek, a rival in the tours and activities business where Zozi also competes. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the two companies will be joining forces, with the assets and team from Zozi heading over to Peek.The news was reported by Skift, which notes that Peek is basically hiring the Zozi employees and bringing its customers on board, while the Zozi brand and marketplace will be phased out.This is a nice, soft landing for troubled Zozi, which has been struggling with legal battles following the firing of founder and CEO T.J. Sassani, who sued the board for wrongful termination and a host of other outrageous claims. Meanwhile, Zozi staff told us that Sassani had been largely absent from the company for months (even skipping its holiday party), had difficult relations with vendors and was spending money on ventures that other members of the executive team didn't believe in and thought could potentially bankrupt the business.In recent days, Zozi had shifted its focus away from its travel and tours marketplace to Zozi Advance, its B2B platform for bookings and reservations. The changes forced the company to lay off nearly 40 percent of its staff earlier this year.But Zozi Advance held promise, the company believed. It said that the SaaS product allowed it to grow its revenue nearly 3x in 2016, and was on track to double its revenue this year.Peek, on the other hand, grew 10x in the last two years, it says. Last summer the company announced a $10 million round of funding, which included Trulia founder Pete Flint joining its board. It has used that funding to invest in its bookings platform, Peek Pro.Zozi tells us that its Zozi Advance customers will be brought onto Peek Pro's platform in the months ahead. The merchants on the Zozi marketplace will be moved over to Peek.com, but Zozi's brand and consumer offering will later be shuttered.Not all Zozi employees will be joining Peek, from the sound of things. The company says it's currently finalizing the team structure, with plans to bring together \"key members\" of the Peek and Zozi teams to \"leverage the best talent in the space.\"\"Peek shares our vision around putting operators first, said Elon Boms, Zozi board member and investor, about the deal. \"And above all, we care about making sure we provide our operators with the best service and technology to help grow and manage their business. This is a big win for the industry and a big win for our operators.\"",

There are a fair few options to play with -- whether it's a mainstream visual sharing platform like Pinterest or a design-focused moodboard-maker like Niice. But just as writers have a variety of workspace preferences, the needs of visual creatives are hardly uniform. So the Australian startup behind Milanote reckons there's room for another approach here.Milanote's platform feels part Evernote, part Pinterest -- indeed, it describes itself as an \"Evernote for creatives\" -- given it's offering users digital spaces (\"boards\") paired with a drag and drop interface that can be used to add and position photos and notes to create visual moodboards or display a grouping of ideas. Its boards are also designed for storing (and/or linking) to related assets -- nesting assets within new boards acting like folders.Boards can also be shared so groups can collaborate and view updates across a project. And Milanote includes a to-do list feature. So, all in all, the platform feels like more of a multipurpose tool than purely a place for designers to play with visuals (though of course you can do that too). But you could also use it to organize and keep on top of research, say, or to create a more visual checklist or chronicle of an event.The platform actually started as an internal tool for the founders' other business (a UX agency) but they decided to spin it out -- launching Milanote in February, and garnering some 35,000 users thus far, according to CEO Ollie Campbell. At this point he says the tool is being used by \"designers, writers, marketers and other creative professionals\" -- working at companies such as Facebook, Apple, Uber, Dropbox, Google, Adobe, Sony and Nike.The team has just closed a $780,000 seed round, led by Simon Martin, the former CFO of MYOB. This will be spent on expanding Milanote's feature set to support what Campbell dubs \"key creative tasks [such as] gathering inspiration from around the web\" (for that it has a \"Pinterest style web clipper\" in the works), as well as on support for video embedding and for more file types.They are also planning to strengthen the collaboration features -- including by adding the ability for users to get feedback from clients, and to comment on updates.\"Milanote is a very 'horizontal\" tool (like Trello/Evernote etc) so we have users from all different industries and roles. Construction workers, poets, artists, authors, game designers, you name it. We have users who are writing novels, planning sermons and organising art exhibitions. But our core target audience is what we call 'visual creative professionals',\" he says when asked who the core user is.\"Creativity is all about synthesising and combining different pieces of information into something new. The problem lots of people face is that their creative work is spread across multiple tools and platforms -- images in Pinterest, notes in Evernote, tasks in Trello, files in Dropbox, messages in Slack. This fragmentation makes it impossible to see the whole picture, which makes it harder to figure things out,\" Campbell adds.\"The key benefit of Milanote is having all of your creative work in one place. This lets you see connections between different pieces of information and trigger new ideas.\"Milanote is a freemium SaaS, so there's a free version with a cap on the number of notes, images or links that can be added to boards, with unlimited storage unlocked at a price -- pricing being dependent on whether it's a sole user or a team.The core push to get visual creatives centralizing more of their project work within Milanote's nested board structure does of course amp up the potential storage requirements which plays into its pricing structure. Though it remains to be seen how much demand there is from visual creatives to do more of their \"communicating spatially\", as the team puts it, vs using a series of digital tools at different points of their creative workflow process -- be it Slack for comms, Dropbox for hosting (and sharing) files, Pinterest for making and sharing moodboards, Google Docs for collaborating and so on.As with any job role that involves playing around with ideas, it's likely to be a case of 'horses for courses'. But Milanote reckons its platform can at least be a contender in the race to gobble up creatives' dollars.",

      "content": "Textile manufacturing takes a heavy toll on the environment, from the pesticides used to grow cotton to the polluted water created by dye runoff. Fashion's short retail cycle also results in millions of tons of waste every year.Plug and Play hopes that its new accelerator, called Plug and Play-Fashion for Good, will solve some of these issues by connecting textile startups with large retailers. The program, a partnership between Plug and Play, Fashion for Good, a global initiative founded by C&A Foundation, and luxury conglomerate Kering, whose brands include Gucci and Alexander McQueen, launched last week in Amsterdam.Its first batch includes companies that create organic dyes from microorganisms (Pili-Bio) and cleaners from carbon dioxide to reduce water waste (Tersus). The full list of startups is: Agraloop, Amadou, Dragon, Dropel, ICA Bremen, MySource, MycoTex, Pili-bio, RePack, Sundar, Tersus and TipaLike Plug and Play's other programs, the textile accelerator's goal is to build relationships between startups and corporations, says Plug and Play founder and CEO Saeed Amidi. In this case, these include Walmart and Target, in addition to C&A Foundation and Kering.\"Technology can find a better way to dye clothes or a better way to grow cotton or reuse end-of-life clothing,\" says Amidi. \"We think the same process of accelerating software startups can be applied to fashion.\"Michael Olmstead, Plug and Play's vice president of corporate partnerships, adds that the accelerator's goals is to take innovation in the apparel industry beyond e-commerce companies.\"Fashion is one of the most polluting industries and we're looking to really accelerate the transition to a very circular industry,\" he says.Some of the startups in Plug and Play--Fashion for Good's first batch are developing new types of textiles made from plants. For example, Mycotex and Amadou both create leather substitutes from mushroom fibers, which are not only biodegradable, but may also help reduce methane emissions from livestock and pollutants from the tanning process.Other companies, like ICA Bremen, focus on accountability in the manufacturing process. ICA Bremen uses nano-technology to create tiny tracers that allows manufacturers to keep track of how much organic cotton fiber a piece of fabric contains, an important criteria for organic certification.One incentive for retailers is that young consumers are willing to spend extra on brands that cultivate a reputation for environmental responsibility.\"If you look at a generation that is really conscious of sustainability, it's millennials,\" Olmstead notes, \"And they are obviously the ones who are spending money.\"",

      "content": "The battle isn't over car sharing. It's not over bus sharing, either, though that, too, is a growing focus for investors and automotive companies that are desperate to understand how cities and transportation are changing. This clash is over the latest wrinkle in urban bike-sharing -- dockless bike sharing. And it has founders and VCs around the globe seeing dollar signs, while regulators are wrestling -- again -- with how to ensure they're not victims of a trend that seemed to emerge nearly overnight.\"Dockless bike sharing is something that people worry about until they realize it's a benefit\" to society, says Atomico co-founder Mattias Ljungman, who calls the ability to leave one's bicycle where a trip ends \"the real revolution here.\" Docking stations are \"very complicated,\" he says. \"Not only do riders need to know where to park their bikes, but sometimes the stations are full. It's a pain.\"Atomico has already placed a big bet on Ofo, a Beijing-based dockless bike-share company that has so far raised roughly $580 million from VCs at a post-money valuation of north of $1 billion. China-based investors are looking to pour even more into the three-year-old company given its current momentum, suggests Ljungman, citing the more than one million connected bikes it has already placed on city streets in China, and customers who are taking an astonishing 10 million rides per day, compared with the roughly 10 million rides per year that London's public bike-sharing service powers.The story is much the same for 16-month-old, Shanghai-based Mobike, which also claims to have more than a million bikes in its fleet and has raised $410 million from investors at a valuation that the WSJ reports is north of $1 billion.Another Beijing-based bike-share company, Bluegogo, is drafting behind both. Founded a mere six months ago, it has already raised at least $65 million from investors.Still, China is not the U.S; it remains to be seen if a variation of the model will work here. \"Just as China will tell you that things that work in the rest of the world won't work in China because of its 5,000-year-long cultural history, things in China don't necessarily work [in the U.S.] either,\" says Sean O'Sullivan, the founder and managing director of the venture firm SOSV.Friend or foeO'Sullivan has been watching dockless bike sharing as closely as anyone. Like a growing number of VCs, he has a horse in this race: New York-based Social Bicycles, or SoBi, which says it was first in producing a dockless bike that features a trackable GPS system and an integrated lock that allows it to be parked at any bike rack in a city.SoBi founder Ryan Rzepecki launched the company in 2010 after serving 17 months as a project manager at the New York Department of Transportation. There, he says, he was witness to the city's earliest thinking about bike sharing, before it partnered with Alta, then parent company of Citi Bike. New York is now home to the largest bike-share program in the U.S., but it required years of advance planning that Rzepecki says gave him \"great appreciation for how cities work and the things that concern them.\"Among them were \"ensuring the bikes would be inspected and maintained, that their docking stations would be kept clean, that bikes would be evenly distributed throughout the city, and that there was data sharing,\" says Rzepecki's then-boss, former New York DOT Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan, who now advises mayors on urban planning. \"It was pretty basic stuff\" that had New Yorkers' best-interest in mind, she adds. \"Rogue bike systems,\" she complains, don't necessarily have the same priorities.\"These new companies seem to be using [the bikes] more like marketing vehicles and using the streets for their private gain,\" Sadik-Khan says of Ofo and Mobike, which are giving city dwellers more freedom to zip around congested cities like Shanghai, but attracting bad press in the process around bike-strewn pedestrian walkways and bikes piled sky high. \"You can create dangerous situations by inviting this tsunami of bikes that could wind up anywhere and everywhere.\"Rzepecki certainly believes they've been less thoughtful in their approach than SoBi, which has more than a thousand of its own bikes in Santa Monica, Ca., and Portland, Ore., among other places in the U.S., Canada and Europe.Most importantly, he says, SoBi has \"entered into a partnership with every city where we're operating,\" he says. \"Having been on the other side, we understood the importance of being good partners.\"SoBi also uses incentives to manage its fleet of bikes so that \"instead of a scavenger hunt to find a bike each day, a user knows that there's a bunch of bikes three blocks away.\" How it works: Users pay per minute, with pro-rated prices ranging from $3 per hour to $8 per hour depending on the city. Most rides last 15 minutes on average, with most trips costing $2 apiece. But riders face extra fees if they lock up a bike outside an area that's been geofenced by SoBi. Conversely, if a user parks a bike in a particular area at SoBi's request, that rider is given a credit.One might think the difference too nominal to pack a punch, but it's \"really effective\" in ensuring equal distribution of the bikes, says Rzepecki. Meanwhile, Ofo and Mobike have no such incentives program in place, counting instead on the market to self-regulate. They also barreled into the many Chinese cities without consulting first with local regulators, a move that investors -- which include China-based heavyweights Xiaomi and Tencent Holdings -- seemed to sanction.That's begun to change more recently. \"Ofo is working with government,\" insists Ljungman. \"It's always looking for solutions.\" Rzepecki hints that they have no choice. \"Shenzhen and Shanghai are starting to put in service standards to prevent chaos in the streets.\"Good or evilCertainly, cities have plenty of reason to want bike-share programs to work, dockless or otherwise. Bikes don't produce carbon emissions, they take up less space than cars and riding a bicycle is a heart-healthy activity.San Francisco, which was caught off guard by plans by Ofo and Bluegogo to enter the U.S., recently proposed legislation around how to obtain and maintain a stationless bike-share permit. (Bluegogo, which initially aimed to park its bicycles in public bike racks, says now it will use bike stations in private parking spaces.)NACTO, an association of 51 major North American cities, issued a statement earlier this week saying it also welcomes bike-share systems of all stripes, as long as they're \"part of a city's overall transportation network and vision.\" (Companies that have \"shown that they are not serious about providing bikes as a real mobility option for people .  . . [but] more interested in media attention and a quick buyout . . . put the public at risk,\" it added.)Dockless bikes make a lot of sense as a last-mile option for commuters, too. Even now, Rzepecki sees a day when SoBi's bikes are electric and work with fleets of autonomous cars and shuttles to get people to their office doors. Ofo has the same ambitions, says Ljungman, not least because China's ride-hailing giant Didi is among its investors. In fact, Didi's customers can already reserve an Ofo bike through Didi's app.As with Uber -- which envisioned itself as a logistics company from the start -- the potential also exists for the bikes to carry more than people. Ljungman says that making deliveries, for example, is \"not something [Ofo] has on its radar, but given they're building a really interesting network and distribution capability . . . the amount of products and services you can attach to that is pretty large.\"Still, it's easy to conclude that investors -- and founders -- are getting ahead of themselves in a race to create the next so-called decacorn.Though Ofo has global ambitions -- it reportedly wants to introduce 50,000 bikes in roughly 10 U.S. cities by July -- Ljungman acknowledges that the U.S. market will be a tough nut to crack. \"You need the right kind of cities. In many places in the world, cities weren't built around cars. They were built around people walking or cycling or even riding horses,\" he notes. \"There's a cultural aspect, too. In Amsterdam, you see lots of bicycles all over the place. They rule the city.\" That's not so in many American cities where bikers represent fewer than 1 percent of all commuters.The economics of the business appear challenged, too. While bike-share companies insist that they're making the bikes as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible in partnership with China-based manufacturers, it hasn't proven a lucrative business to date. For example, Motivate -- which bought Citi Bike from Alta in 2014 -- now oversees more than 10,000 bikes across bike-sharing programs in 10 U.S. cities and recorded 14 million rides last year, and it still isn't profitable, says a source close to the company. Presumably, making electric bikes will be even more costly.And there are shenanigans. According to O'Sullivan, the founders of one dockless bike-share startup met earlier with Rzepecki under the guise of wanting to fund SoBi, which has reached profitability off $7 million in funding to date and is now looking to raise substantially more. They then used their findings to raise money for a new startup of their own.Asked about the claim, Rzepecki declines to confirm it, saying instead, \"A lot of people are entering the market and maybe being a bit more opportunistic in trying to compete. For me, it's generally a good sign that we have an environment now that's being capitalized, even if not everyone has the same intentions that we have.\"It's almost like the second coming of Uber. At least, people seem to hope that's the case.\"I do think Uber's bad-boy behavior has emboldened some to also break laws and charge ahead of social consequences,\" says O'Sullivan. \"They got away with it, and they got rewarded for it financially, despite hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements to state regulators and elsewhere.\"Until Uber came along, I never thought it could possibly have worked. Now others may see it as a model worth copying.\"Additional reporting by (and valuable insights from) Lora Kolodny.",

      "content": "Disrupt NY is but a month away, and we're more excited than ever about our brand new Founder Spotlight.The Founder Spotlight gives young but proven startups the chance to tell their origin story, from that original \"Aha!\" moment to the pivot, if there was one, to today. It will also give budding entrepreneurs the opportunity to hear actual founders talk about their journey from their old job to being top dog at a rapidly growing startup.We've already revealed the first three companies participating in the Founder Spotlight, and today we have three more for you: Capsule, Nestio, and PS Dept.Capsule is a re-invention of the pharmacy. The company has built out its own team of pharmacists and an actual brick-and-mortar pharmacy in NYC so that users can have their prescriptions filled and delivered whenever they want. While most pharmacies invest profits back into the retail side of the store, selling candy and magazines, Capsule instead invests its returns back into its chat services, letting users ask questions and get medical information via SMS, web chat, and email. Capsule has raised money from Thrive, but has yet to disclose the amount.Nestio first launched in 2011 as a consumer-facing service to help renters find apartments, aggregating Trulia and Streeteasy listings in a single app. Since, however, Nestio has pivoted to solve for the core problem: out-of-date listings. Brokers, management companies and landlords have been using antiquated technology for years to market and update their listings. With Nestio, which operates on a standard SaaS model, those same parties are able to communicate amongst each other in real time, providing a much better experience for their own clients, the renters.PS Dept combines big data and the wits of a real person to make sure its users have the easiest, most accurate access to information around designer clothing. Most high-fashion shoppers know what they want and they want it now, but access to information around availability can be difficult to come by. PS Dept uses an easy messaging platform to help users find the bag, shoes, or blouse that they've been searching for, while providing brands and retailers with a dedicated customer service arm. PS Dept has raised $6.4 million to date.Alongside the super stars of the Founder Spotlight, Disrupt NY's speaker list is downright awesome.

      "content": "Netherlands-based accelerator program Rockstart, which focuses on helping startups through their first 1,000 days, has launched a new vertical program for artificial intelligence startups -- touting it as Europe's first AI-focused accelerator.The AI program will be accepting applications from next month, and Rockstart says it will pick ten startups for the six-month program, which will commence in September. Teams will be based in s'Hertogenbosch.Rockstart has been accelerating startups since 2012, and is backed by partners including Google, Amazon and IBM. It says the new AI track will be supported by mentors and partners including the locally-based Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS).There's no specific industry focus for the program -- with the idea being to attract AI startups from a range of industries. \"We consciously decided not to narrow it down in order to have startups from different industries working under one roof -- that's, in my opinion, where innovation often comes from,\" says a spokesman.\"We indeed have seen a number of startups with AI at their core in our other programs over the past couple of years. With this new program, we want to be able to add more value for startups like those by delivering relevant tech/business expertise, knowledge, and partnerships,\" he adds.The selection criteria for the AI track will be the same as for Rockstart's other programs.\"We're looking first of all at the team, and then at the product/idea and whether it's actually demanded by the respective industry. If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail, so one of our goals is to avoid employing a technology for the technology's sake. In the selection process we're going to focus, among other things, on whether AI is really the best solution for the problem the startup is trying to solve,\" the spokesman tells TechCrunch.Startups accepted for the program will receive EUR20,000 cash and EUR80,000 of \"in-kind funding\", office space in Den Bosch for the duration, and support from mentors from relevant industries, as well as more than 50 perks and deals (billed as worth some EUR600,000) from program partners.Named mentors for the AI track include Dr Eric Postma, professor at JADS; Jasper Wognum, the founder of BrainCreators; Dr Mykola Pechenizkiy, professor at Eindhoven University of Technology; and Christoph Auer-Welsbach, partner at IBM Ventures and initiator at City.AI.Rockstart says it expects to take a 6 percent stake in startups entering the program -- after they've raised their next round of funding.Last month US-based startup hothouse factory Y Combinator also launched a dedicated AI track. So while all startups will likely be AI startups in the future, there are dedicated accelerator programs springing up to plug the gap in the meanwhile.",

      "content": "London-based Beamery has closed a $5 million Series A for its candidate relationship software. The round is led by Index Ventures, with participation from existing investors Edenred Capital Partners, GP Ventures and LocalGlobe.It's a fast follow from the startup's $2 million seed, raised in June last year. Beamery says the new funding will be used to double its headcount and open a new sales and marketing-focused office in the Bay Area, while keeping its core product dev and engineering team in London.In a blog about the funding, Index's Jan Hammer argues Beamery's approach to recruitment gives companies a strategic advantage in hiring by enabling them to identify and develop relationships with potential future recruits before they even have a specific vacancy to offer.\"When you shift to this approach and become highly strategic in developing relationships with top candidates, you outsmart and outpace competitors,\" says Hammer, citing Beamery's claim that its users have seen the cost of hiring fall by 39 percent and time-to-hire drop by 31 percent since using its software.The startup, which was founded back in 2014, has around 50 customers using its software at this point, including the likes of Facebook, Dropbox, VMware and Criteo. Active users number around 1,000, according to CEO Abakar Saidov.\"In short think of it like Salesforce + Marketo for recruitment. We are an API-first CRM platform that lets companies track the entire candidate lifecycle from Lead > Application > Hire. This changes how companies recruit on a strategic level. We use AI and automation to scale this process,\" is Saidov's elevator pitch for the platform. Beamery's software essentially offers a richer environment for tracking and connecting with potential job candidates versus a manual organizational tool such as a spreadsheet, while also plugging in the ability for users to search candidate profiles using granular filters; make approaches to potential hires via email marketing and/or event invites; and view analytics of candidate responsiveness so they can judge which potential hires might be most receptive to an approach. The underlying premise is to turn recruitment into more of an active and ongoing brand marketing/outreach exercise, versus companies only searching for candidates at the point of direct need, and limiting their talent pool to only those who actively apply.  \"Nothing is built to be a system of record for passive candidates for roles that don't exist yet,\" argues Saidov. \"Therefore you are missing the bulk of the market. The more progressive companies that are recognizing that you need to go after and 'Acquire' the talent you want have to use spreadsheets to store this data.\"Rather than having 'job-centric' ATS systems, this is 'people-centric' CRM system. That means businesses can focus on leads rather than applicants. This means everyone is a potential candidate, a relationship that needs to be tracked and nurtured before, during and after the applications process.\"Saidov says the platform is not geared toward specific sectors or job roles but is rather aimed at \"every business that is trying to be strategic\" about recruitment -- though the first wave of customers has, unsurprisingly, come from the early adopter tech sector, along with some \"more traditional\" brands, such as House of Fraser, Shop Direct and Continental Tires.\"We help tech firms map their future hiring needs and retail firms re-engage past talent that didn't get hired,\" he adds. \"Finally you are seeing the full cycle of talent management, rather than just the applicant process. This allows you to be strategic about where talent is going to come from.\"On the competitors front Saidov name-checks Avature, \"a more dated talent CRM,\" and Smashfly, which he says is focused on job board distribution, as the main rivals, along with some (unnamed) content management systems.",

      "content": "One of the earliest and most prominent startups of the so-called \"sharing economy\" or \"gig economy\" is evaluating the possibility of selling itself. As reported by Recode, freelance work marketplace TaskRabbit acknowledged that it is contemplating a sale after receiving inbound interest from a possible strategic buyer.TaskRabbit launched in early 2008 as a way to match up with various types of odd jobs in their local area part-time workers who had spare time. In its earliest days, the business operated in a very loose marketplace model -- users could list jobs they needed accomplished and the price they were willing to pay for those services, and so-called \"TaskRabbits\" could choose to accept those jobs or not.It was a pretty novel concept at the time, but it wasn't long before a number of other startups cropped up offering similar capabilities. Over time, those gig economy companies started to position themselves around specific types of work, with many attempting to be the place to go for cleaning services or home improvement.A few more years passed, and, after some initial excitement around the gig economy, follow-on venture capital dried up and many of TaskRabbit's competitors either shut down or were acquired for pennies on the dollar.And so here we are. After raising $38 million dollars from investors like Shasta Ventures, Founders Fund, First Round, Floodgate, CollabFund and others, there's little appetite for other investors to keep putting money in companies like TaskRabbit.So what now? All indications are that handyman services, light home renovation and furniture assembly are going to end up being a billion-dollar business. So it makes sense that TaskRabbit would explore the possibility of a sale if there's a buyer -- or multiple buyers -- interested.The only question is who those buyers might be, and how much they might be willing to pay for the business.",

      "content": "On Wednesday I had the unique pleasure of hanging out with a bunch of Macedonian startup founders and was very impressed. The Balkans have long been a promising spot for startups - the cost of living is low and the talent level is high - and this visit was unique in that everyone was fully prepared to pitch on a global scale.The winners of the pitch-off were Letz, a cool chatbot that won a Best Technology Product award on Product Hunt and TakeAnAd which makes it easy to capture and post Facebook ads. One of the judges came from Grouper, a shopping app that single-handedly brought online shopping penetration from 1% to nearly 100% in less than a decade.In short, these were some solid ideas and they were working hard to push things forward.The most interesting thing I've noticed over the past few years is the spread of the \"theatre of entrepreneurship\" - the ability for young people to pound out excellent two minute pitches in harsh environments. This means a few things. First it shows that these techniques are truly global - the same can be said of folks in Skopje as it can be of folks in Skokie. Further, it means that cool things are everywhere.The biggest problem for these places is seed capital. I've spoken to a number of investors from various cities who offer a bunch of hand-waving and wiggling as they explain that they only do see rounds in companies in their back yards or with plenty of traction. I would argue that companies in markets outside of New York, LA, SF, Berlin, and London - companies situated in places where offices are $850 a month and salaries are comparably low - could produce some real winners more consistently if they had access to small injections of capital early on. VCs, on the other hand, want to see growth and revenue and they want to be able to bike to the startup offices which means a kid from Skopje has to be shelling out a few thousand a month to satisfy the whims of a professional No-man.There are small funds trying their damnedest to help and they envision a time when their smaller markets will become true farm teams for global reach.Will this happen? No. The stewardship of capital is too important to a dude in Palo Alto to consider dumping it in Zagreb. The risks of dropping cash in Warsaw - which we could argue are minimal - are too great for a post-Brexit Londoner. The only answer it sees is for these small markets to send their best and brightest to accelerators in the Valley and hope for the best although I would argue that a programmer situated nicely in Skopje with a cheap apartment and a great quality of life is going to be a longer-lasting employee than one who lands in SFO from Tirana, lives in a squat with five other people to work on a product, and then gives up and works for Google.Of course I'm being needlessly cynical. After all, as evidenced by the teams that pitched, these companies are easily able to fend for themselves, with or without investment. But a shot in the arm and a pat on the back could definitely help.The challenges facing folks in Skopje and Belgrade and Warsaw and Vienna are not small. In a culture that rewarded career longevity, pensions, and a retirement at the dacha the idea that you would eschew a cubicle at Citibank is akin to blasphemy. It takes guts to get up and pitch in English and it takes guts to fight for every ounce of cash and it takes guts to succeed even in your little corner of the world. This effort should be rewarded with appreciation, support, and education. I'm not yet sure it is, obviously, but we're getting there.",

      "content": "London-based Triptease, a startup that offers a SaaS to help hotels increase direct sales and therefore keep more revenue, has closed a $9 million Series B. The new round was led by BGF Ventures, with participation from existing investors Notion Capital and Episode 1 Ventures.Triptease was founded in 2012 on the premise that hotels can do a much better job at direct selling rather than letting a plethora of online travel agencies (OTAs) and hotel booking aggregators, such as Booking.com and Expedia, cream off the top of their profits by means of affiliate revenue. Triptease's best-known product is Price Check, a widget that sits on hotel websites and displays prices from across the web in real time.The idea is to reduce the uncertainty surrounding a hotel's direct price, and ensure you don't wander off to search elsewhere but instead book direct and with confidence.That in itself is a neat trick, but the startup has since expanded to offer a number of other features built around the notion that hotels can make much better use of their data, both individually and anonymously in aggregate, to increase their ability to compete with the OTAs.\"By signing up to the Triptease platform, hotels with only a few thousand web visitors a month can learn from the millions of user sessions the company are tracking across the industry,\" says the company.This includes real-time price alerts if an OTA/aggregator cuts its own prices in order to manage parity, as well as personalizing the experience of direct online visitors by giving the right message at the right time so as to increase conversion. Or, as the Triptease website puts it, \"convert lookers into bookers.\"Meanwhile, Triptease says it will use the new capital for further product development, and to fuel growth and international expansion, specifically in Asia. This will see the company open a new office in Singapore, in addition to doubling headcount in its existing London and New York offices.Adds Rory Stirling, partner at BGF Ventures, in a statement: \"We are very excited to be joining Triptease as a new investor at a time when the company is showing great growth in the markets where it has established a presence. Now it's time to expand the software to Asian hotels, to make this a truly global product. With consolidation amongst online travel agencies, hotels are increasingly looking for options to help them mobilise people to their own websites and Triptease is the best in its sector.\"",

The obvious goal is to invest in startups which fit well with Swiss Post's strategic business development areas and offer potential for Swiss Post's core competencies to make a key contribution to their future success. Through targeted investments, Swiss Post also wants to participate in technological development in an effort to counter the displacement of logistics companies by technology companies. Swiss Post is particularly interested in startups in the following sectors: e-commerce, mobility, digital financial services, digital trust (e-post), cross-channel communication, business process outsourcing, and sales and solutions for major business customers. In return for an investment, Swiss Post requires only a minority interest. This allows the startups to continue to develop with agility in the market. This corporate venture capital initiative is long-term in nature and enjoys the full support of the company's leadership team. When selecting and assessing the startups, Swiss Post works with investiere.ch, a venture capital specialist, provider of an investment platform, and one of the most active startup investors in Switzerland. As part of the collaboration, Swiss Post has already made an initial investment in a robotics startup. Founded more than 160 years ago, the Swiss Post has long relied on the innovation of more than 61,000 employees in-house and conducted innovative projects with startups. In light of the challenges posed by digital transformation, Swiss Post is now additionally strengthening its capacity for innovation with targeted investments in startups. investiere.ch is one of the leading online startup investment platforms in Europe. The investiere community, which currently counts 10,000 members, independently identifies the most promising startups, which are then carefully vetted and selected by industry experts and the investiere team. To date, investiere.ch has successfully concluded more than 50 rounds of financing. investiere.ch was launched in 2010 and has offices in Baar, Zurich and Geneva. ",

      "content": "Thanks to VentureFriends, a new fund that was launched in 2016 and had its final closing a few weeks ago, Greek startups now have access to EUR20 million of additional funding. The VentureFriends team consists of ex entrepreneurs who have been angel investors in Europe and US for many years. Their goal is to actionably support and connect Greek founders with the global tech scene. Apostolos Apostolakis has been active in the startup space since 2004 as one of the founders of e-shop.gr the first e-tailer in Greece, while in 2011 he co-founded e-food, a leading food delivery marketplace. In 2015 e-food was sold to DeliveryHero constituting one of the major exits for the Greek startup ecosystem. The two VentureFriends partners Apostolos and George Dimopoulos were also among the first angel investors of Taxibeat, which was sold for reportedly more than EUR40 million earlier this year. As an angel investor, Apostolos has also invested in a number of other successful startups like Booksy, Spotahome, Reztoran. By the end of last week, we sat down with Apostolos to do a little interview and to learn more about VentureFriends. Here it is: Apostolos, why did you and your partner George create VentureFriends? I strongly believe talent is everywhere and I feel for amazing founders who are based in peripheral markets like Eastern/South Europe or Turkey and do not have the same access to funding and networking like their UK or central European peers. As angel investors, my partner George and I have experienced the limited options of startups in peripheral markets. How much are you planning to invest per startup and what is your investment focus in terms of industries and development stage of the company? We plan to start with a EUR300-500k investment and can go up to EUR1 million. Our investment focus is e-marketplaces, end SaaS/high tech products. Examples on the marketplace side are projects like easyhero.com, spotawheel.gr and e-table.gr, and on the SaaS/high tech side it is Blendo.co, contactpigeon.com and flashchat.ai. We want to get involved in a post product phase when the startup has small revenues and has at least proven a first level product-market fit. Are you exclusively investing in Greece-based startups, or also in Greek or partly-Greek founder teams who are based elsewhere in Europe? We also invest in Greek teams internationally like the case of instashop.ae, convibo.com and Weengs.com. In any case even when we invest in Greek teams based in Greece, the expectation is that the team will soon venture internationally. Our vision, which we share with our founders, is to help create international champions. It is imperative to keep an eye on the US regarding startups. Scaling for a SaaS or a technology startup cannot happen without the US market in mind. As angel investors, the VF team has also been involved in a few US startups like Shift, Cardflight, Triplemint and LeadIQ. How do you see the development of Athens as a startup hub? It it a good place to build a tech company, or would you advice ambitious founder from Greece to go to London or Berlin instead? Athens is a good place to start. There is a solid talent pool and the local ecosystem is growing.  The culture of cooperation and the sense of urgency are improving. Athens is a good starting point but remains at a competitive disadvantage once a startup wants to scale. Eventually a globally ambitious startup (especially a Saas one) will have to gain presence in London or  the US so that they tap into a larger talent and customer base pool. How many investments did VentureFriends do so far? Actually we have already done 20 investments in the last 15 months. Given the lack of funding there was a number of startups from Greece that had no options and were on our radar screen from our angel investing years. We were driven by our desire to support outstanding founders who deserved to get funding. In other cases, as in our international investments we proceeded opportunistically so as not to miss opportunities to partner with great people. For example, that was the case with Adespresso where I was an angel and then suggested the VF investment to Armando and Massimo the founders. Adespresso was sold within 9 months to Hootsuite providing a first exit for VF. ",

Founded in 2013, the Delft-based foundation is developing advanced technologies to rid the oceans of plastic. This week, The Ocean Cleanup announced that it has successfully raised $21.7 million in donations since last November. This latest funding round brings The Ocean Cleanup's total funding since 2013 to $31.5 million. This new contribution allows The Ocean Cleanup to initiate large-scale trials of its cleanup technology in the Pacific Ocean later this year. This significant funding round is led by San Francisco-based philanthropists Marc and Lynne Benioff and an anonymous donor. Other supporters include the Julius Baer Foundation, Royal DSM, and Silicon Valley entrepreneur/investor Peter Thiel. Over the past four years, The Ocean Cleanup has been developing a passive plastic capturing technology, which uses the ocean currents to catch and concentrate the plastic, reducing the theoretical cleanup time of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch from millennia to years. The Ocean Cleanup aims to launch its first experimental cleanup system in Pacific waters by late 2017. It will represent the most important milestone on the road to the full-scale cleanup of the world's oceans. Details on this project and the start of the cleanup will be shared with 3000 supporters at an event on Thursday May 11th at the Werkspoorkathedraal in Utrecht, the Netherlands, and will be followed by a media Q&A. Marc Benioff, the Chairman and CEO of Salesforce stated: \"Lynne and I are thrilled to support The Ocean Cleanup's important goal of eliminating plastic in our oceans. With Boyan's innovative leadership, I believe The Ocean Cleanup will have an incredibly positive impact on the future of our oceans. I hope other leaders will join us in supporting these efforts.\"  Boyan Slat, the founder and CEO of The Ocean Cleanup, commented: \"Our mission is to rid the world's oceans of plastic, and this support is a major leap forward towards achieving this goal.

Founded in January 2015, Adaptive Simulations is a deep tech startup offering fully automated simulations based on leading edge research. The young company offers its cloud-based SaaS solution globally and aims to democratize the virtual simulations market. There are currently around 500K users of non-automated flow simulations while the potential global market for automated simulations is estimated to more than 10 million users. The product innovation behind Adaptive Simulations is enabled by adaptive algorithms, based on years of research in numerical analysis, computer science and CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Now the research is finally mature enough for commercialisation. The algorithms replace the cumbersome and complex work done manually by simulations experts today. Sebastian Desand, the CEO of Adaptive Simulations explains: \"Fully automated flow simulations, has been somewhat of a holy grail for the simulations industry. The implications of automated flow simulations can be compared to the automation of weavers in the 19th century. The leap from manual weaving to automated weaving transformed the textile industry completely. Now, we want to do the same with the simulations industry.\" Altogether the solution offered by Adaptive Simulations provides the following: Dr. Gert Kohler, Managing Partner at Creathor Venture, comments: \"We are convinced of Adaptive Simulations' innovative solution and see great potential in automating flow simulations across multiple industry verticals. We see a market need for effectiveness in design processes while maintaining high accuracy and performance. The team behind Adaptive Simulations is well positioned to serve this need and to become leaders in the simulation software market.

      "content": "The process of adopting cloud technologies can be a daunting process for first-time founders setting up their company. To fight back the difficulties of understanding and using the cloud, Aruba Cloud has launched We START you UP, a program open to all startups around the world. Running for three years, those taking part will work closely with Aruba Cloud, which will provide some of the most innovative startups with a cloud credit worth up to EUR50,000 to be used on Aruba's Cloud platform. During this year's EU-Startups Conference on April 13 in Berlin, we had the great opportunity to cooperate with Aruba Cloud's We START you UP program, since they were an official sponsor of the event and also contributed to the main prize of our big pitch competition. We START you UP can be broken down into four different phases: START Stage: This is the entry-level package where startups have access to EUR3,000 of Cloud credit per year for three years, as well as ongoing training support. Training: Training days and webinars to help startups understand the extent to which the Cloud can help their business to begin with, and then help them learn about the tools they need to grow thanks to this technology. Orientation days are broken down into several stages, and they will also be attended by our incubator partners. Pitch Day: This is an event during which startups will have the chance to talk to Aruba experts about their own ideas for using Cloud resources with a view to benefiting from the UP Stage package, aimed at startups with real potential for growth. UP Stage: This is the package designed for projects that during Pitch Day were judged as suitable for getting the most out of all the potential of a Cloud platform as powerful as the one that can be created using the free credit offered by Aruba. This way, the startup will be able to increase Cloud resources using an enterprise level architecture, thus releasing all the power of their own business model. This stage offers free Cloud credit worth up to EUR50,000, valid for 24 months, plus advice from Aruba Cloud architects.\n Stefano Sordi, Aruba's chief marketing officer, said: \"For young companies with an innovative technological model, the cloud can offer a huge boost, and our main goal is to provide all the know-how and tools, so that technology is no longer an issue capable of slowing down a potentially explosive business model.\" The We START you UP program helps early-stage startups to grow their business and offers technology that guarantees the highest level of service based on the Aruba Cloud model. This way, startups are handing over the burden of managing data centers and infrastructure to Aruba Cloud, which means the startups have more time and resources to dedicate to their own growth. While the startup program does not involve any costs for startups, even after the 3 year duration of the program the young companies will be able to benefit from special offers for maintaining the platform on a pretty affordable basis. By the way: To celebrate the first anniversary of the launch of the .cloud domain extension, also managed by the Aruba Group, Aruba Cloud has also decided to offer an additional bonus of a one-off payment of EUR1,000 to all the startups chosen to take part in the program who use a .cloud domain as the main domain for their business. What are you waiting for? Apply now to take advantage of the We START you UP program. ",

      "content": "Within the scope of its strategy to tap into further operative revenue sources, the Berlin-based investment firm German Startups Group takes aim at two new business fields. For this, it intends to make use of its position as the most active private venture capital investor in the German startup ecosystem since 2012 and plans to extend the purpose of the company. Subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting, German Startups Group plans the creation of a secondary market platform for unquoted shares in startups, presumably together with partners. While such platforms, e.g. SharesPost, have established themselves long since in the US and other countries, Germany is kind of a developing nation in this respect. The creation of liquidity for so-called secondary shares is in the interest of all parties involved - the founder, business angels, and employees of startups as well as the startups themselves and their investors - and therefore offers lucrative business opportunities. Even today, German Startups Group has established a reputation as a buyer of secondary shares and receives many unsolicited purchase offers, but can itself only seize a fraction of these opportunities. Additionally, German Startups Group intends to issue participation rights in the future for the increase in value of individual portfolio companies, subject to approval by the respective portfolio company. It has been shown in recent years that many private investors have an interest in direct investments in portfolio companies of German Startups Group that are not accessible to them. By issuing participation rights, German Startups Group intends to enable these investors to directly participate in the value creation of individual startups in the growth stage. The issuance of participation rights would lead to a capital inflow that would be used to acquire shares in the respective portfolio companies so that a so-called balance sheet extension occurs and German Startups Group increases in size. The goal is a generation of a so-called \"carry\", i.e. a profit-share in the increase in value. German Startups Group is a publicly listed investment company based in Berlin that focuses on startups from the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). Since it commenced with operations in 2012, German Startups Group has built up a diversified portfolio of 43 investments. 24 of the 43 minority stakeholdings in operationally active companies are of particular significance to German Startups Group and together comprise 91% of the total value of all 43 active minority stakeholdings. The ten core holdings alone make up 62% of the value of all active minority stakeholdings. ",

The fresh capital comes from the founding team itself as well as from angel investors. iCasting was founded in 2014 and will use the fresh capital to roll out and further expand its online platform, which connects talent and clients the easy way. ICasting does not deal with agents and does not charge a matching fee, but allows clients to find talents without delaying expensive mediation. This unique approach makes iCasting incomparable with traditional casting agencies and has ensured that many talents and clients have embraced the platform. ICasting aims to create new opportunities worldwide and opens markets where no-one has ever offered solutions. ICasting serves the entire market: from starter talents to experienced professionals and actors, extra's, models, dancers and hosts to the most diverse entertainers. The iCasting CEO Esmee Pater stated: \"It is our ambition to make the casting market transparent again throughout the world. iCasting is a fantastic startup that will disrupt the casting world. We do this with a unique technological platform where talents and clients come together without the need for a very expensive middle man. This investment initially helps us with the Dutch expansion of iCasting as a basis for our ultimate international ambitions.\" Pater continued: \"Every day we welcome a lot of new talents, and over 900 national clients have already embraced us. In addition, we provide all our talents of the information and knowledge they need to further develop, through the specially developed interactive video courses on iCasting TV. \" iCasting has an advanced matching database which not only matches all the external features of talents, but also their knowledge and specific skills: dialects, sports, cooking, and even possessing a sailing license. In addition, matching talents and clients with iCasting is faster than the traditional way: iCasting matches a talent in a few minutes, which usually takes days to weeks. As a compensation, the talent receives exactly what the client pays out. This way iCasting created a system that is beneficial to both parties. Together with the entrepreneurs and co-founders of iCasting, Bob Breeman, Erwin Arkema and Yillmaz Schoen, iCasting will be busy in the coming months to conquer the Dutch market. ",

Then you should take a look and apply at the recently launched WARP Future Communication program for startups. It's an initiative by hub:raum (the Deutsche Telekom startup incubator) offering unique opportunities in the area of communications. According to current AngelList data, today in the world, there are about 2.9 million startups. But only a minority of startups actually survive beyond 3 years. Luckily, there are ways to increase the likelihood of making it long-term. This is where the WARP Future Communication program comes into play, with the goal to provide expert support and valuable contacts to a selected group of startups. There are four well-known pillars for building a successful tech startup: an innovative idea, a broad range of knowledge, technical and financial resources, and execution. It seems simple - but in reality, it's a true challenge to combine creativity with knowledge and experience in a wide range of areas (to mention just a few: management, going to market, sales, customer service, etc.) - along with having a well-functioning technical platform and support. Taking into account that 80% of successful startups have multiple founders, involving a large, well-established corporation with appropriate resources, plus a startup accelerator with unique knowledge, can not only successfully bring the idea to life - but even more importantly - bring that idea to the market. hub:raum and Deutsche Telekom are now inviting startups from across Europe to the new WARP Future Communication program, which aims to develop innovative communication services by offering the opportunity to accelerate the business and go to market with strong corporate partners. WARP Future Communication is designed for startups with innovative ideas in communications and related areas such as speech recognition, parental control, artificial intelligence (AI), voice-based messaging, digital life and generally enriched voice and video communication experience. The program provides a mixture of all the tools and resources startups need to develop, scale, and commercialize their services, including both technical and business support. WARP Future Communication offers the technical platform, network, and know-how for startups - and provides a unique opportunity to go to market. Don't miss your chance and apply until April 30 here!

      "content": "With over 7000 living languages and a multi-billion translation industry, Unbabel might have just found a way to transform the \"lost in translation\" phrase into business.  Unbabel is creating fundamentally new ways for businesses to interact with consumers across language barriers and borders. Building out its natural language processing (NLP) platform, they combine the work of some 40,000 human translators and editors with artificial intelligence and machine translation mechanisms. By using technology to aid human translators, Unbabel's platform simplifies the translation process and dramatically lowers costs.  The company, which was founded in 2013 and has raised $8 million to date, is one of the most successful Portuguese startups and was cited as one of Business Insider's \"startups to watch in 2017\". In order to learn more about Unbabel, we talked to Vasco Pedro, the Founder and CEO. Here is the interview: Unbabel is creating new ways for businesses to interact with consumers across language barriers and borders. How did it all start? Both Vasco Pedro (CEO) and Joao Graca (CTO) have PhDs in Natural Language Processing. It was clear since the beginning that neither Machine Translation or Human translation alone would solve the fundamental problem of a multilingual world. Machine Translation doesn't have the quality required and human translation is not scalable. The benefit of the process is that you have a highly scalable translation with human quality. From Lisbon to San Francisco and back, what was your journey like to get where you are now? Different cultures SF vs Lisbon. Gave us a sense of what's important. Lot's of hard work, no shortcuts, being a language company and experiencing new cultures really drives the point home. Coming back to Lisbon was a purposeful decision given the availability of talent, great startup conditions and the opportunity to have huge impact in the local startup culture and economy. What makes Unbabel different form the rest of the language translation startups? Unbabel is vertically integrated, from the base machine translation to the tools for Unbabelers (our global community of 50,000 bilinguals) to work on, to the integrations that customers use on a daily basis. One great effect of this is that we have incredible data that no one else does. And in machine learning, data is the big differentiator. You were part of the Y combinator acceleration program. What do you think got you there and what would you recommend to future applicants for the program? For YCombinator you have 10 minutes, there are no slides, it's just a conversation, they ask you to show them what you got, a demo if you have it, and it's all very real. It's high stakes, you have four people firing questions at you and then when the time's up they say 'okay you're done, that's it'. And what they do is, if they call you, you're in - and if you're out, they'll send you an email with feedback explaining why you didn't get in. They called us on our Portuguese number, I answered the phone and it was Garry Tan saying they really liked us and that they liked the market and that they would like to invite us to join YCombinator. I told them 'yeah, cool, tomorrow we'll go to Seedcamp but then we'll come back' and Garry was like,'no, you're in YCombinator, there's no need to go to Seedcamp'. We eventually agreed, of course, and sent an email to Seedcamp explaining the situation. We then celebrated for like 10 min. and went to bed - we were exhausted from the jet lag. YCombinator follows the motto: the relentless pursuit of growth. Focus on what's important - if this metric is important to you forget about everything else, you'll focus only on this and grow at least 10% every week. It's really tough to get those 10%, but when you simplify and focus everything on one thing it's easier. Every decision you make is based on that, because that's what matters. You put your life on hold for 3 months, for 3 months of your life you'll only do this. This is a huge advantage. You focus on your product and talk to your customers thinking that you need to grow those 10%. I would totally recommend it to anyone. The best way to do that is simply to be concise in your application. But every unnecessary word in your application subtracts from the effect of the necessary ones. So before submitting your application, print it out and take a red pen and cross out every word you don't need. And in what's left be as specific and as matter-of-fact as you can. You and the 4 other co-founders seem to be getting along very good. What would you recommend to other startups with multiple founders? Pay off your emotional debt. If you're a startup, you tend to have technical debt which is fine and accepted. Likewise sales and marketing debt. But the one thing you really can't accumulate is emotional debt between the founders. I think that's the number one killer of startups. You have the little issues that build up on a daily basis, the little tensions, and you don't address it. And then when something big comes up you kind of are discussing everything else. What we do to prevent that, well, each company has to figure out its own thing. For us it's a number of company activities that allow us to get out of our workstreams and connect with one another in a different context. The biggest one is surfing. Once a month the whole company gets in a couple of vans or buses and we head to a beautiful spot on the Lisbon coast to hit the waves or relax by the beach. It helps to clear the mind and reminds us that we're working with people we respect and that we enjoy hanging out with. Those are the moments we can have the best conversations. When you're standing in the sun in a wonderful place and you're willing to connect.  What is Unbabel focused on right now? Since our Series A funding round in October 2016, we've been investing heavily not just in bolstering our technology foundations for scale, but in the commercial functions we need to get our products and services in the hands of many, many more companies and people around the world. We've hired a Chief Revenue Officer, senior sales reps and a whole team underneath them to support this.  As a rising star of the Portuguese startup ecosystem, how much has the ecosystem helped you get where you are and what is your overall impression of it? We made a very conscious decision to turn down offers of staying in Silicon Valley after Y Combinator in order to return to our hometown in Lisbon and build something big over here. We wanted to, and so far have achieved a lot, in capitalising on the research and engineering talent coming out of (or returning to) Portugal. Although we don't have the same opportunities afforded to us, we see the probability of having a bigger impact here and indeed the world as much higher than being just another company in San Francisco.  Now we have people fighting in the trenches - but then you need the heroes. You need astonishing exits so that people realize it's possible. Having a startup is not like having a local shop or business, it takes a lot of time and it takes a lot from you, emotionally. But, honestly, I don't think it will take long for us to see those success cases.  Unbabel was the first Portuguese startup to get into YCombinator, then there was Orankl and then after that the number of Portuguese startups trying to get into YCombinator increased so much just because people realised it was possible. Portugal is a lot like California. Even geographically. We don't need to re-create Silicon Valley in Portugal, but we need to have the same kind of successes.  Something that they told us in the last dinner at YCombinator that annoyed me, but I kind of have to agree with, is that 'lameness is contagious'. So, in fact, you're not a Portuguese company or startup - you're competing at a global level, on a global market. It's important that your surroundings push you to the limit. Like when we were at YCombinator, everyone kept on pushing us, because everyone is working so hard, and pushing for results, that it is contagious. It's inspiring, there's a compound effect. Nowadays it's all about traction. So for me having a lot of startups pushing each other is key to have a strong startup ecosystem. You can't just think you're a Portuguese company, it's easy to be tempted by it - but you need to go further. Portuguese companies sometimes think small, and startups are kind of changing that. We need to change that mentality. And, in order to change it, we also need to bring international people to scene. What is next for Unbabel? We're working to, and hitting the targets on a very ambitious business plan to grow 300% in 2017 and again in 2018. We've just cleared the last hurdle in launching on the Salesforce App Exchange and we'll be cementing our foothold in customer communications with new product integrations as well as growing much faster in e-commerce listings management.

Besides existing shareholders HBT Holdings and KfW, KPN Ventures invested in this round. KPN Ventures is the venturing arm of Dutch telecommunications group KPN and is one of the leading European IoT investors. The nello one hardware upgrades any existing intercom unit to give apartment dwellers the ability to control the main entrance door with their smartphone. That allows them to enter keyless and also share access with delivery companies or visitors. Dr. Christoph Baumeister, the Co-Founder and CEO of nellow stated: \"The financing round allows us to grow the team, support our market entry and create partnerships with leading European delivery companies. That brings us one step closer to our mission to simplify urban life.\" Herman Kienhuis, the Managing Director from KPN Ventures added: \"The nello team has developed a very clever proposition, giving family and friends, but also delivery companies and other service providers remote access to apartment buildings in a simple and safe way, and nello has already generated an impressive amount of pre-orders for its first smart intercom product. We look forward to supporting nello in the further development of its smart home proposition and in its international roll-out.\" The nello system is very simple: Customers connect their nello one with the existing intercom unit in the apartment. All the necessary tools and wires come with the product. The wiring details are specific for every intercom system and customers can follow a step-by-step guide in the app. Once connected, the intercom unit can be controlled through the nello cloud that is connected through the local Wi-Fi. The iOS and Android apps can by downloaded for free. In combination with a smart lock at the apartment door, nello enables complete keyless access. Also, nello can be voice controlled through Amazon Alexa. nello one can be pre-ordered now and will be shipped by the end of this month.

      "content": "The Dutch startup ZIVVER has just secured an investment of about EUR3 million from venture capital investor henQ and current investors. ZIVVER's software allows organisations and private individuals to email, chat and share very large files in a secure environment. The software helps people become aware of the risks related to sensitive information and helps prevent data leaks. Founded in 2015, ZIVVER provides its users with active support by giving targeted warnings and employing simple security measures. ZIVVER CEO Rick Goud explained: \"Most data leaks are caused by human error. That's why ZIVVER warns users even before they hit the send button. It's a unique, but mostly a necessary solution in these times of cyber crime and stricter rules regarding data leaks.\" The Dutch Personal Data Protection Act was tightened in 2016, making it mandatory for organisations to report data leaks. In 2016, organisations reported approximately six thousand leaks to the Dutch Data Protection Authority, which translates to roughly twenty leaks per day. A single data leak can involve the details of thousands of people. As almost 40% of all data leaks originate from healthcare organisations and the public sector, this includes medical and other sensitive data such as Citizen Service Numbers. More stringent privacy legislation will be introduced throughout the European Union starting in May 2018, which will see fines for the failure to protect personal data increase to up to 4% of company revenue. Add to this the damage to the company's reputation and repair costs, and the impact of a data leak becomes abundantly clear. Organisations, including many in the healthcare sector, currently use regular email servers, free chat services and online file transfer services on a massive scale. Although these might be easy to use, ZIVVER argues that they are not secure. Jan Andriessen, Associate Partner at henQ stated: \"Data leaks are a substantial threat for organisations working with sensitive data. ZIVVER provides a secure alternative that is driven by user-friendliness. This focus, coupled with a growing awareness in healthcare and the public sector, means that this company could well grow out to become the prime supplier of secure communication.\" The Amsterdam-based startup ZIVVER plans to use the investment to further optimise its Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) solution. The primary goal of the ZIVVER team is to expand their client base in hospital care, geriatric care, primary healthcare, mental healthcare and the social domains of Dutch municipalities. The company is also scoping out opportunities for further growth in Europe and is investigating new markets, such as the financial services industry. In just two years' time, the startup has grown considerably thanks to earlier investments from angel investors in the healthcare sector. Their team now consists of over twenty professionals, and has managed to bring in dozens of clients, including GGZ Rivierduinen, St. Jans Gasthuis hospital and the Gooise Meren municipality.  ",

Overall, more than 140 startups applied to participate. 15 of them made it to the finals and pitched in front of an expert jury and our roughly 360 attendees. At this year's pitch competition we had a great mixture of exciting business models and ambitious startup teams out of 9 different European countries! In the end, it was the Berlin-based FinTech startup B2B Pay which won the competition and took home the prize package worth EUR17,500. The package includes prizes/credits from cloud technology provider Aruba Cloud (value: EUR9,000), the email service SendGrid (value: EUR2,950), the CRM, project management & invoicing solution Teamleader (value: EUR3,600), the design marketplace 99designs (value: EUR1,000) and our Job Board (value: EUR950). B2B Pay is a German/Finnish startup which offers virtual bank accounts for companies that export into Europe or export from Europe to the rest of the world. The mission of B2B Pay is to make international business transactions as quick and as cheap as possible with complete transparency about costs. B2B Pay simplifies the bureaucratic process and eliminates the need for back and forth paperwork. Long story short: B2B Pay is tackling a huge market with a promising business model and the company's CEO delivered a very good pitch! This combination then led to the jury decision in favour of B2B Pay. The expert jury consisted of Alexander Kolpin (WestTech Ventures), Robin Dechant (Point Nine Capital) and Thomas P. Offner (PwC). According to the jury, it was a tough decision, since there were many other strong startups that took part in the competition. Once again: Congratulations to the B2B Pay team and to the startup's CEO Neil Ambikar who represented the company on stage!

      "content": "Drop your laptop and hope on your bike for a 300 km journey. That's what near 400 entrepreneurs, investors and techies have done since 2012 by participating in the initiative called TechBikers, an unusual way of supporting children's education in developing countries through the charity Room to Read. Next May 12-14, TechBikers is launching a new CEE ride by hitting the road between Vienna - Bratislava - Budapest gathering 50 riders from the tech communities from the 3 cities but also from all over Europe. \"We have participants from the tech communities in the region but also from London or Copenhagen. We have still around 10 slots available.\" says Pierre Charvet, leading the CEE project from Bratislava. You can sign up before April 24th on the TechBikers CEE webpage. They have already raised more than EUR1.300 thanks to the first riders already signed up. Their goal is to reach EUR20.000 for this first ride in this region. No need to be a professional biker! Anyone can participate and accept the challenge. The ride is not a race or a competition. The goal is to cycle and finish as a team for a sole and unique cause. The aim of the initiative is to support charity, network, share ideas and spread the start-up vibe during an unusual weekend. The money fundraised contributes to building schools and libraries in developing countries. Behind TechBikers is Eze Vidra, former Partner at Google Ventures (and Founder of Google Campus), Benjamin Southworth, ex Deputy CEO at Tech City UK, and Abraham Choi, Founder of Decision Analytics and Mark Jennings, Founder of Shaken. \"The TechBikers community is incredible. Once you join a ride, you are taking part of a real family. Everyone stays in touch, helps each other and also help in promoting or organising a ride.\", says Pierre Charvet. The conditions to sign up is the payment of a minimum fee of EUR300 to contribute in the cost of each rider, while it is expected to fundraise at least EUR300 for Room to Read. Organizers themselves, for example, advises selling cakes or contacting friends and family to reach the fundraising goal. All the logistics is organised by TechBikers and supported by great sponsors like Janom, Slovak Telekom and Dagital Legal. TechBikers aims to fundraise at EUR1 million by the end of 2017. You can check the video below to see what is like to be part of the TechBikers community!  ",

      "content": "Skyscanner, one of the top global players in the travel-metasearch-engine business with over 50 million users monthly, has just been acquired by Ctrip. Thanks to the acquisition they made in Budapest back in 2014, I had the chance now to have an interview with the Co-Founder & CEO Gareth Williams. Where do you personally come from? What did inspire you to start Skyscanner? I learned simple assembly language as child with my dad, playing around on a BBC Micro; I loved programming as a way of expressing yourself through making games patterns on the screen. That lead me to studying maths and computer science at university. Before Skyscanner was born, I worked as a web developer contractor, chiefly in the banking sector, and it meant I worked for two weeks, then had two weeks off. For those two weeks, I'd visit my brother, who was living in the Alps at the time. The idea for Skyscanner arose from frustrations in trying to find cheap flights, from a number of London airports, to a number of airports that served the Alps area. It was so complicated and time-consuming, and I reasoned that there must be a better way to compare my travel options. I got together with two friends from university, Bonamy Grimes and Barry Smith, to try and solve the problem. We sat round a table in a pub in London, scribbled some ideas on a beer mat, and slowly the idea for Skyscanner took shape. From a simple excel spreadsheet, Skyscanner was born. Me, as an average user, also know about other companies on the market shooting for the same market segment. Some call them competitors. How do you differentiate yourself from them? Who do you consider your competitors at all? There are a few ways we're different from other players in the space. Firstly, we've built our travel search technology from the ground up, making it proprietary and best-in-class. This means we have direct connections with many of our partners, so we can provide the best, most up-to-date range of options for travellers. This makes us a unique travel marketplace: unlike other travel search sites, we're not reliant on obtaining our search results through a third party. We take a global-yet-local approach, and not only do we power travel search for well over 50m unique monthly visitors every month, we also power travel search for well-known global brands like MSN and Lonely Planet, who use our technology in a white label solution. So as you can see, we place a large emphasis on technology - our team is made up of approximately 50% engineering talent, and our technical spend is around the 50% mark also. We remain very much a start-up in the way we work - employees are given lots of flexibility and trust to work in the way that is best for them, so we see a lot of innovation. For example, we were pioneers in the travel search space when it comes to conversational bots on the likes of Facebook, Skype and Amazon's Alexa. How do you define yourselves with one word or expression? Innovative. What were the main stumbling blocks for your startup, especially during the first year, and what would you do differently from today's perspective? Well we were rather unusual at the time in two ways - one, the dot-com bust happened in 2000, and it was in 2001 we first started working on Skyscanner, in a time where confidence in internet businesses was very low. This also meant that it was really difficult to get funding for Skyscanner, so we had to bootstrap the business. We ended up sharing two salaries between three of us, with me working on Skyscanner full time while the others kept their day jobs. The other aspect was that metasearch at that stage was not a well-known or understood term, and the concept was very new. That meant it was really difficult getting airline partners on board with the idea, especially when we were so small. But we persevered - I always say, tenacity is one of the defining principles of entrepreneurship, and it certainly served Barry, Bon and I well. How did you meet your co-founders? Bonamy Grimes and I met each other in our first days of university in Manchester together. We bonded over a shared love of music. We met Barry later and the three of us had a few ideas for businesses over the years, from property to a music service. However, it was with Skyscanner that we really saw a service where there was a real need for it - we were convinced there was a way to make travel search simple, and that's still our aim today, even as a global company a decade later. How does the team look like? What is the size and setup? Today, the team is made up of over 800 people, across 10 offices globally, including an office here in Budapest. We're made up over 50 nationalities, and are organized in a 'tribes and squad' model: in essence, people work in small start-up groups of no more than 8 or so people. This allows everyone to have a lot of autonomy and flexibility in their work. Here in Budapest, the team is mainly involved in product and engineering, and we're currently recruiting for a number of roles here, including senior mobile engineers and senior systems engineers. Can you tell something about the business model and how it has changed? A lot has changed in terms of the size and scope of Skyscanner. We started out with budget flights in Europe, and today we compare flights, hotels and car hire globally. And of course, a team of over 800 people across various time zones has different needs from when we were just three people working from my spare room! But at the heart of things, we've kept true to our values and our ethos. I never wanted to work in a rigid organization with lots of bureaucracy, and happily Skyscanner is still a forward-thinking, relatively flat-structured place where people really enjoy coming to work. We've won multiple awards for our workplace environment, and that's something I'm very proud of. Working from home is very common, and we have some great programmes in place, whether for continued learning or for colleagues to travel and work in other offices across the world for up to 30 days. How have you raised money? What was your first big success about it? We boot-strapped the business at the very start, and that served us well. It meant we naturally had to be very agile and allowed us to put a lot of emphasis on refining the product. In 2007 we took PS2.5m from Scottish Equity Partners and later in 2013 we received secondary investment from Silicon Valley's Sequoia Capital. In January 2016 five new partners invested PS128m between them. Then, in December last year, we were acquired by Chinese travel company Ctrip. It's a really exciting time for us - we'll remain operationally independent from Ctrip, but we'll be able to leverage their knowledge and insight to propel Skyscanner forward and take the business to the next level. After making an acquisition in Budapest, how do you see the CEE region for startups and scale-ups? And specifically, how does Budapest look like to you, coming from Edinburgh? It's a fantastic place to be and our Budapest team is hugely talented and enthusiastic- we're very lucky to have an office here. Like in Edinburgh, there's a real buzz in the city when it comes to tech start-ups, and the community is a warm one, where people are very open to sharing learnings and knowledge. We host several meet-ups and events for the tech community on a regular basis from our Budapest office too, so it's great to see the breadth and strength of the tech scene here. After your successful exit, what are the next steps? How do you see the next 1 year? What is the next milestone to achieve? While we've been acquired by Ctrip, the team very much remains the same, as does our aim in making travel search as simple as possible. As such, we'll remain operationally independent and we'll continue to innovate and deliver great travel products across the world. I recently published a whitepaper setting out Skyscanner's vision for the future of airline distribution and the changing role of metasearch within this. Our intention is to transition towards becoming a marketplace in which travellers can shop for a rich array of air fares with a seamless process from start to finish across any device. The metasearch space is one that is an ever-changing one, so I'm very much looking forward to what the future will bring. ",

      "content": "The Munich-based Industrial IoT startup KONUX announced today that it has raised another $9 million from existing investors, led by New Enterprise Associates (NEA). This internal round was the third and final close of their Series A financing, bringing the total raised to $16 million. Other participants in the comprehensive Series A include: MIG, Upbeat Ventures, Andy Bechtolsheim, Michael Baum, UnternehmerTUM, Warren Weiss and Lothar Stein. KONUX is one of the very few German startups that were able to attract leading Silicon Valley VCs. Dr. Greg Papadopoulos, Venture Partner at NEA and former CTO at SUN Microsystems, will be joining the KONUX Board of Directors. He stated: \"KONUX has the potential to have a massive impact on the industrial world through its AI solutions. It will significantly change the way companies approach their asset management and maintenance processes. KONUX has demonstrated impressive progress with its predictive analytics solution for railway operators and has successfully installed its first systems in the field - giving us the confidence and excitement to increase our original investment.\" KONUX was founded in 2014 and has raised a total of $18 million in funding and has built a team of currently 35 employees. The Munich-based startup combines smart sensors and AI-based analytics to help customers know their assets' performance in real-time and switch to predictive maintenance. The company's vision is to enable a data-driven industrial world. The Board Observer Dr. Torsten Kreindl, Managing Partner at Upbeat Ventures and former longtime Swisscom board member said: \"Predictive analytics for critical assets is one of the largest opportunities for industrial companies in the era of digitalization.

The company has also begun its successful expansion into further European markets. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) startup enables rail operators to digitize their network through condition monitoring of switches, the most critical part of railway infrastructure. The smart sensors and analytics solution will help them predict maintenance needs in advance and react in time, thereby increasing network availability and punctuality. Over the last months, KONUX was awarded the German Mobility Price as well as the German Digital Price \"Spark Award\" for its predictive analytics solution. The startup and its founders furthermore made it into the \"AI 100\" list by CBInsights and the \"Forbes 30 under 30\". The additional funding will be used primarily for the development of new product features and the market entry in further European countries. KONUX CEO Andreas Kunze stated: \"We aim to continue this strong momentum and drive IoT implementation with real business results. We feel very proud to have our current investors believing in us and supporting us on our journey. This additional funding is a true show of their confidence.\" ",

Asia is a key market for us as we continue to execute on further scaling our products, and Raine, with its network of relationships and deep partnerships, will be an invaluable partner to us.\" Blair Ford, the Venture Partner of The Raine Group commented: \"Many popular esports titles exhibit a very steep learning curve. DOJO's products improve the experience and engagement of players in their favorite games, and as such, are equally of great value to publishers. We couldn't be more thrilled to partner with such an experienced and passionate team.\" No longer a niche pastime, the global esports audience will reach nearly 400 million in 2017, split equally between devoted esports enthusiasts and occasional viewers.

      "content": "CheckRecipient, a machine learning startup that aims to end the problem of misaddressed emails once and for all, has raised $2.7 million in a round co-led by Accel and LocalGlobe, with the participation of Winton Ventures, Amadeus Capital Partners and Crane. The young company will use the fresh capital to double its size to 24 people, with a focus on hiring business development and engineering expertise. Founded in 2013 by three engineering graduates from Imperial College, the London-based startup CheckRecipient has developed an email security platform that uses machine learning to make sure sensitive or confidential data cannot be sent to the wrong individual. CheckRecipient scans historical email data to understand conventional usage patterns and behaviours in companies' email systems. Using machine learning allows CheckRecipient to spot anomalies and give users a chance to correct problems before sending. Unlike existing rule-based systems or encryption platforms, the system requires no administration or end user behaviour change. Following rapid take-up in the City of London, CheckRecipient is working with multinational companies across the legal, healthcare and financial services worlds, with a view to launching in the US shortly. It is also developing CheckRecipient's technology to address additional security concerns that organisations have identified with email and documents. While there are daily scare stories about cyber attacks and the potential cost to business, basic human error and misaddressed emails are a much greater problem for companies in the financial services, legal and healthcare sectors. According to the Information Commissioner's Office, misaddressed emails were the leading digital security incident reported in 2016. A wrongly addressed email can lead to a loss of clients, revenue, and serious reputational damage. From May 2018, the new EU General Data Protection Regulation will impose a mandatory requirement for organisations to report data breaches involving personal data to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), and fines for the worst breaches will increase to up to 4% of an organisation's global turnover. While there are lots of products on the market designed to make email more secure, they all require a high degree of behaviour change from end users or significant administration from IT teams, meaning that their effectiveness is diminished. Tim Sadler, CEO of CheckRecipient, said: \"It's human nature to fear the shark when we go swimming, but it's crossing the road, an activity we do daily almost without thinking, that is more likely to kill you. There's currently an obsession with the detection of malicious insider and external attackers, but the most common data security incidents reported to the ICO are all linked to human error. CheckRecipient allows organisations to demonstrate diligence to both clients and regulators by managing the risk of misaddressed emails. It also helps firms to protect staff from mistakes, which could cost them their career, in highly regulated, reputation driven sectors such as law and finance.\" Luciana Lixandru, partner, Accel, commented: \"CheckRecipient is developing an extremely effective product that resolves one of the corporate world's biggest problems. As the technology is developed, there are a number of additional possible applications which will turn CheckRecipient into a gold-standard email and data security product.\" CheckRecipient is already used by blue-chip names in London and in legal circles including a FTSE 100 financial services company, the world's largest publicly traded hedge fund, Man Group, and Europe's largest hedge fund, Winton Capital. Law firms who are using the product include Penningtons Manches and Travers Smith as well as some UK Top 10 and Magic Circle firms. ",

The annual event brings together EU policy makers and 15 of the fastest growing European scaleups to meet Silicon Valley stakeholders during a highly interactive week of local presentations and meetings. Taking place in the San Francisco Bay Area each September, the event provides a unique networking space for breakthrough European companies to explore sales, funding and collaboration opportunities. The two-way exchange provides European businesses with the contacts and insights they need to scale up on the other side of the Atlantic and at the same time keeps Silicon Valley abreast of the increasingly dynamic European startup ecosystem. European scaleups can apply until May 31st. To be considered, scaleups must have had at least 10 employees three years ago as well as demonstrable growth of over 20% year-over-year in revenue, employees, or user-base. Find out more and apply now! Speaking about co-organising this event with Mind the Bridge, EIT Digital's CEO Willem Jonker said: \"We're delighted to be working with Mind the Bridge for the third year in a row to deliver what has become a focal point for the entrepreneurial communities across two continents. For us it's about encouraging mobility - our job is to create the right opportunities to help European scaleups grow and break into new markets including the USA. There can be no better example for this purpose than SEC2SV.\" Marco Marinucci, CEO and founder of Mind the Bridge commented: \"The current wave of development of digital technologies has the potential to disrupt industries that are at the very core of our economies and democracies. Platforms like SEC2SV, now at its 3rd edition, can become the middle ground where these discussions can take place early in the game. An open discussion with policy makers is absolutely necessary and we're ready to welcome all the major players in September.\" EIT Digital is the leading European open innovation organisation.

      "content": "I was at a startup event this week in London and I met a founder working on a insurtech startup that is at idea stage. I liked the idea and he asked me what I thought about accelerators. I will share with you what I told him. There are some good fintech and even insurtech accelerators in London, one of which is backed by a large number of insurance corporations. These programs are valuable to get good mentorship and expedited access to work with these corporates. However, a founding team can potentially reach these mentors and corporates without getting into these accelerators, if they can build a good advisory board and personal network that is connected to these corporates, mentors and investors. Obviously this takes work and time and the founders need to weigh the options. A vertical focused equity accelerator brings these connections in a quick, concentrated and managed way and often gives some cash and good partnership deals, but good programs also ask for equity. There are a few non-equity accelerators that add a lot of value with contacts and mentors, such as Mass Challenge and Microsoft Accelerator. While getting into them gets harder each year, I think these are really good options. However, they are usually generalist programs. Founders can try to hack their own way by finding super advisors and giving them some equity and options to get them on board and motivated, and build the right network with their help and network. The equity you would give away would typically be less than what funding accelerators ask for. The tradeoff is that you would have fewer but more motivated advisors versus larger pools of mentors in accelerators you meet. And if speed and competition is an issue, the accelerator may be better option as the team that gets into the right accelerator can make progress faster and grab some key milestones and assets (accounts, partners, vendors, investors). For certain startup areas that rely on network, you sometimes see there is one alumni startup doing that from each of the top accelerators. Are accelerators really worth it. F6s.com, a website that provides services to accelerators and similar startup programmes, lists more than 12,000 programs worldwide, a good number of which are probably accelerators. Probably thousands of entrepreneurs that go trough these programs, uniformity of experienve and answer is probably impossible. However I would like to share some off the record conversations I had with MDs and alumni of some of the top 20 global accelerator programs. A managing diretor of a top program in Europe, which is harder to get into than Harvard, shared that he starts his program with telling the founders to drop all the marketing they used to get into the program and really lay it bare, say where they are and where they are going. Even tough these programs ask for extensive data and analyze them and even do interviews with founders, it is very difficult to understand a startup before establishing trust and spending at least a few hours together. For me, this implies that the selection processes are imperfect, which I would agree with in my experience. This also means that founders should not take rejections seriously and keep applying and working. I also worked closely with a founding team for a year that got into not only one but two top acceleration programs in Europe. Now when we ask one of the 2 cofounders, he says that one of the programs did not contribute much, but it must be noted that that program was a non-equity program and it was recently established. Regarding the other funding program they participated, their experience is more positive, they got a lot of mentorship, started their vesting process, streamlined their business and started really going after a scalable business model and a way of pursuing it. If you can benefit from the network, if the network is relevant and the advantages that will come from this network will exceed your time investment, good non-equity accelerator programs are no brainers. The best kind of network you can get these from programs are obviously mentors who help you find product-market fit, investors, advisors, customers or sales channels and talent. If you are really good at networking and persistent, you may be able to reach this kind of network without going through an accelerator. It might take more time, or you can be more targeted and effective. Again requires the founders to weigh the options. I think product market fit is the most important stage for a startup. In fact, Steve Blank describes a startup as an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model which include product-market fit and then business-model fit. Before a startup reaches this point, only those activities that help a startup achieve this are worthwhile, and all others are distractions, including publicity, which can in fact hurt more than help before product market fit. Therefore, founders who have not yet reached product market fit should evaluate accelerators to see if they would help here and talk to happy and unhappy alumni. If a startup has fit, then the founders should evaluate accelerators to see if they would help with business model fit and if they are beyond it, with sales, channels, scaling. It is all a matter of where you are. ",

      "content": "The Dutch startup SciSports today announced that it has raised an extra EUR1.8 million with existing and new investors. The fresh capital will be used to roll-out the SciSkill Index worldwide and implement the BallJames data machine in various stadiums in countries such as England and Germany. In the last few years, SciSports has worked on building the SciSkill Index, a fully automated solution that calculates the quality, talent, and value of every professional football player in the world. With the in-house developed capturing reality technology called BallJames, which generates complete 3D data in real-time, we created a refined total solution that immediately converts events in practice or during the match to useful information and knowledge. SciSports started in 2012 as a spin-off of the University of Twente and currently has 45 employees. The Enschede-based company has been working for several clubs and agents in the Netherlands, Belgium, England, Portugal, Brazil, Germany, and Italy. The SciSkill Index is probably the only objective worldwide player index that makes it possible to compare the quality of football players all around the world. Every week, over 2000 matches in 210 leagues are analyzed by the SciSkill algorithm, through which the SciSkill Index automatically adjusts the quality of 350.000 football players in an index. The index measures the influence of a player on a match and the individual development. With this, it calculates the market value and the potential of a player, based on his current quality and the growth of other players in the past. The SciSkill is not only interesting for clubs, as it also beats the bookmakers in predicting matches and is the ideal input for Fantasy Football games. BallJames is a real-time tracking technology developed by SciSports that automatically generates 3D data from video images of football matches. In the stadium, fourteen cameras are installed, which record all the movements on the field. BallJames then generates its own data such as the precision, direction and speed of the passing, sprinting strength, jumping strength, player movements and how close the ball stays to the foot after a first touch. The Polman Stadium of Heracles Almelo is the first stadium in the world equipped with this system. At the moment, a second stadium in England is being equipped with the first official Beta version of Balljames and in collaboration with the University of Twente, a test field will be set up for academic research. Giels Brouwer, the founder of SciSports stated: \"Football is our focus. With the SciSkill, we have created a new opportunity to help clubs finding talent in undiscovered regions. The unique part is that we have built an index that values a player regardless of his position, club or nationality. Our Datascouting department helps the clubs and explores the market, while the Intelligence department automates their findings through Machine Learning. For this to work, we continuously need better data, which is why we started developing BallJames with which we cover the complete value chain in football. We have noticed that not only the world of sports is open to this new form of information. That is why this year we will invest in automated tooling for the media, gambling and gaming industry.\" Gerrit-Jan van Ahee, the CTO of SciSports added: \"When BallJames is done, a lot more is possible. Think VR, goal-line technology but for the whole field, think second screen possibilities besides watching football on your TV. It is impossible that we will also deliver the end product in all those markets, but with our engine we will fill the role of pure data supplier. We seek collaboration with existing parties in the market and want to solve the current limitations for them.\" ",

      "content": "The first three months of operation have been highly productive for the Riga-based FinTech startup VIAINVEST. EUR1 million have already been invested into consumer loans through the platform. The great activity of investors once again proves the growing demand for alternative investment opportunities. Founded in 2016, VIAINVEST is a peer to peer lending platform providing alternative online investment opportunities - both private individuals and legal entities are welcome to invest in consumer loans originated by the VIA SMS Group and its daughter companies operating across Europe. Since launch, VIAINVEST has significantly increased its investment portfolio and currently boasts an offer of up to 12,2% annual return to its investors. Eduards Lapkovskis, the CEO of VIAINVEST stated: \"We are pleased with what we have achieved in these first months after launch - if we take into account that the number of peer to peer lending market participants has raised noticeably, funding one million euros of loans within such a short period of time is a significant success. Our main priority is to ensure outstanding investor support as well as a seamless investing experience to build a trustful relationship with all our clients.\" Since the launch of the company in December of 2016, the development of VIAINVEST has never stopped. VIAINVEST is a part of the alternative financial services provider VIA SMS Group, operating its daughter companies and brands in Latvia, Sweden, Poland, Czech Republic and Spain. Eduards further explained: \"The truth is that you can find gaps or opportunities for development only when the platform is live - when real investors come in, try the features and share their experience. The majority of our investors come from German-speaking countries and traditionally pay significant attention to the details especially when it comes to their finance management. In response to the high demand we now offer the possibility to browse VIAINVEST in German. VIAINVEST will soon also be available in Latvian.\" ",

      "content": "Peakon, the London and Copenhagen based people analytics startup, today announced the completion of its latest funding round of $6.5 million. Lead investor in this round was EQT Ventures, along with Peakon's existing investors, IDInvest, Sunstone and angel investor, Tommy Ahlers. Peakon creates tangible improvements to employee engagement and retention through insights delivered via its SaaS platform. These insights are generated through the automated collection of employee feedback via web and mobile apps, which is then analysed using the latest machine learning techniques, to understand what motivates employees, what problems they have, and how those problems can be fixed. Since launching in early 2016, Peakon has been rapidly adopted by hundreds of enterprise clients such as World First, Trinity Mirror, Secret Escapes, and Lombard Risk. Peakon was founded in late 2014 and already operates across three locations in the UK, Denmark, and the US, and is expected to treble headcount to over 100 in the next 12 months. This rapid growth has been fuelled by its emergence as a leading provider of employee engagement and people analytics software - which Deloitte estimates is already a $1bn market. Phil Chambers, co-founder and CEO of Peakon said: \"We have been overwhelmed by the positive response to our platform, and have found ourselves in the fortunate position of being in a booming market with a leading product. Due to revenue growth, we were already in a solid financial position, and decided to capitalise on this by accelerating our growth plans, particularly in building out our machine learning, data-science, and engineering teams. The EQT Ventures team brings some fantastic operational experience in international scaling, marketing and product and it's great to have them on board. With a customer base that is growing across Europe and also in the U.S., they're a great match for us.\" Lars Jornow, Managing Partner at EQT Ventures stated: \"AI is tipped as one of the key tech sectors for investors this year, and the team have had an impressive start, demonstrating strong revenue growth and product adoption. We are thrilled to be able to support them for the next stages of the company's development. Workplace culture and being able to track, analyse and act on employee engagement is becoming increasingly vital for all of the top performing companies in the world.\"  ",

      "content": "We sat down with Candace Johnson, President of the European Business Angels Network (EBAN), to chat about Rising Tide Europe, a programme aimed to attract business women to come together, become angel investors, and invest together. The programme is primarily for women who are new angel investors and want to learn through trainings and observation how experts conduct due diligence, as well as negotiate and manage investments. After a successful Rising Tide Europe 1, which gathered together 94 women from 24 countries across 4 continents to learn by doing with angel investing and making 8 investments across 5 countries, EBAN and its partners are now launching Rising Tide Europe 2. What is Rising Tide Europe? Who is it for? Rising Tide Europe is a global movement which got started in the USA and Europe simultaneously in the summer of 2015 and is now extending to Africa. The idea behind Rising Tide is to attract women angel investors to come together and invest together. There is a group of experienced \"Lead Investors\" who then share their knowledge and experience in making good investments with a group of executive women who may not ever have made angel investments before, but bring a lot of experience, expertise, and network to investee companies. Why this focus on female investors? Is not it better to have gender balanced pool of angel investors? To be honest, first of all, it is fun!  I, for one at age 64 after having almost always been the only woman as an entrepreneur or angel investor in a group, find it absolutely delightful and invigorating to be together with a group of exceptional women dedicated to investing in \"The Next Generation\". Yes, of course it is nice to have a gender balanced pool of investors. Take the example of Golden Seeds in the USA. They started out as an all-women investor group and today have 40% men. At the moment, we are focusing on women angel investors because it is an un-tapped pool and we want to create a \"nation of investors\" in Europe. Women represent the largest group of \"low-hanging fruit\" for angel investors in Europe How much money are you planning to invest? In our first programme and fund, Rising Tide Europe 1 raised EUR1 million and we invested in 8 wonderful companies across 5 countries in Europe. With Rising Tide Europe 2, we are targeting EUR2 million and will invest in about 15 companies across Europe. All those interested in applying for the Rising Tide Programme of \"investing and learning while doing\", should register your interest. You're also the President of EBAN. Please give our readers a short intro regarding this association and its goals. EBAN is the European Trade Association of Business Angels, Seed Funds, and Early Stage Market Players. We are a Network of Networks dedicated to creating a \"Nation of Investors\" here in Europe to insure that we have a \"Next Generation\" and not a \"Lost Generation\". We encourage, inspire, and help private investors to make the best investments in innovative companies that will change the world for the better. Who is Candace? What is driving you in life? I bound out of bed every day, eager to bring positive change to the world. My slogan is \"Never accept no for an answer, Never give up, and Never go away even when others want you to\". I believe that everyone has a personal responsibility to make the world better than when they entered it. Be it as an entrepreneur, be it as an angel investor, this is what absolutely drives me every day of my life. ",

Hosted by Widebridge Group, the event is going to take place on May 23 in London and will bring togeter CEOs, CTOs, and CIOs from around the EMEA region. Enterprise EMEA is an invite-only event, but you can apply for an invite through the event's website. Greg Wolf, founder of the Enterprise EMEA conference and Widebridge Group, stated: \"With all the hype around consumer focused startups like Snap and Uber, none of them would be able to do what they do without enterprise software. Enterprise software is like the digital picks and shovels behind the success of all businesses, and is a much larger market than the consumer market.\" According to the organisers, there is a lack of enterprise software events that encompass the entire enterprise, especially in Europe. That's why Greg and his team created Enterprise EMEA, an event focused on enterprise technology - for the startups, investors, and the ultimate buyers of these companies. An event where all get together to foster more investments, more knowledge sharing and more deals. Several companies that attended last year's edition of Enterprise EMEA have raised large rounds of funding or exited with big acquisitions over the last 12 months, such as London's Weaveworks, which raised $15 million last May from Google Ventures and Accel, or PNMsoft, which was acquired by Genpact.  Greg Wolf further explained: \"Enterprise EMEA is unique in the enterprise tech world. Most of the large vendors like Cisco, Microsoft, SAP, etc. all have their own large events. We bring executives from all of those companies together to network with each other, with the startups and with the investors in their ecosystem.\" Among the speakers and attendees will be representatives from companies like Microsoft, Salesforce and SAP as well as investors from firms such as Atomico, Lakestar, Index Ventures, Blackstone and KKR. One of the many even highlights will be a panel discussion on how EMEA enterprise startups can find success on a global scale. It will be joined by Balderton Capital's managing partner Bernard Liautaud, who before joining Balderton, was the founder of BusinessObjects, which got acquired for $6.8 billion by SAP in one of Europe's biggest enterprise tech exits till date. As mentioned in the beginning of this article, Enterprise EMEA is invite-only. To request an invite and for more details please visit the event's website. ",

      "content": "Elvie, the female-led British company dedicated to developing smarter technology for women's health and lifestyle, Just raised $6 million from Octopus Ventures and with a participation from female focused VC AllBright. London-based Elvie will use the fresh capital to roll out into 25 additional countries across America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, as well as launch a second device, all before the end of 2017. Elvie's first pioneering product, which went to market in October 2015, is a kegel tracker and app which is recommended by professionals across the health and wellness space. It is currently distributed at large retailers and boasts celebrity fans including Gwyneth Paltrow, January Jones and more recently Khloe Kardashian. The market for Elvie's first product is significant; 1 in 3 women experience pelvic floor problems at some point in their lives, and the figure among pregnant women and new mothers is even higher, reaching up to 80%. The NAFC (National Association for Continence) estimates that  200 million people around the world suffer from various forms of urinary incontinence and this number is likely to continue to grow with the ageing population. Elvie's proprietary data shows that 8 in 10 users of their Kegel tracker reported improvements to their pelvic floor strength, with over half of them reporting a significant change in less than two weeks. Elvie's second product, which the company will launch before the end of the year, is aimed specifically at new mothers, a $1.2 billion dollar market. Launched in 2013 by Tania Boler and Alex Asseily (Jawbone Founder), the company became breakeven within six months and is currently growing its customer base 50% quarter on quarter. Today, Elvie operates across 59 countries and in 2016, it generated $1 million in revenue from direct sales alone. Elvie's ambition is to become the world's number one health tech brand for women, by offering new intelligent and connected tools to improve women's health at a global scale. Tania Boler, Co-Founder and CEO of Elvie commented: \"Our mission is to become the leader in femtech by improving the health and wellness of women everywhere and at all stages of their life through smarter technology. The combined backing from Octopus and AllBright is a huge mark of credibility for Elvie. Octopus is the leading consumer tech investor in the UK and we're proud to partner with such an experienced investor with strong expertise in taking British brands to the U.S. Elvie and AllBright share the same mission of advocating for female-led technology. Together we are committed to push the boundaries of innovation applied to women's issues.\" Simon King, Investment Manager at Octopus Ventures stated: \"With health and lifestyle mobile apps growing at an estimated 700% per year, we've only just scratched the surface of how intelligent technology can improve people's health. Elvie is addressing an unrivalled market for women's personal health and has already established itself as the leader in this category. In particular, Octopus focuses on backing unusually talented teams - and Tania and her team are exceptional. We're thrilled to accompany them in this new phase of growth, rolling out in new geographies and extending the reach of what connected hardware can do for women's personal health.\" Elvie received $3 million in funding in previous seed rounds, as well as a further  $1.5 million from several government grants. In addition to its rapid growth and profitability, Elvie has already received 12 awards for innovation and design, including Innovator of the Year for Tania Boler at the 2016 everywoman in Technology Awards. Elvie will use their talent for transforming medical technology and expertise into effective and well-loved consumer products to disrupt an established market with their second product. ",

      "content": "BrainWaveBank, a health-tech startup that develops data-centric solutions for tracking brain health, has just secured over PS1 million in funding from the Government-backed Angel CoFund, techstart NI, Innovate UK and Invest Northern Ireland totalling. BrainWaveBank was founded in 2015 and is helping to address major cognitive health problems through innovative technology. Dementia has a dramatic effect on the lives of sufferers and carers, affecting many millions of people around the globe, and there is critical need for early detection technologies. BrainWaveBank's technology allows individuals to easily track their cognitive health on a daily basis from their home. A low-cost wearable device, together with a smartphone or tablet, will combine the user's responses while playing games that challenge different cognitive skills with recordings of their brain activity. Through advanced analytics and machine learning methods, the system will detect the earliest signs of cognitive decline and empower people to make simple lifestyle changes to encourage healthy aging of the brain. Finding the first precursors of dementia will also give medical and pharmaceutical researchers the power to develop new therapies, and in the future prevent or cure the disease. BrainWaveBank is also active in contact sports. Both professional and amateur sports teams are increasingly concerned with players' cognitive health and the effect of impacts on their long-term brain health. American football has accepted that sports-related concussion can lead to debilitating brain disorders later in life, and there is growing consciousness of the issue in rugby, soccer, and ice hockey. BrainWaveBank's platform can profile each player's brain fitness and track the day-to-day performance of the player over the course of the season, providing insight into subtle effects of impacts, sleep and other training and lifestyle factors on the short- and long-term cognitive health of the players. This round of funding will see the business invest heavily in technology as it looks to build out its neuroscience platform and further develop affordable hardware for mass consumer markets. This will be a major step forward in the business' mission to dramatically reduce the cost of measuring cognitive performance via brainwave activity and to take sophisticated brain imaging out of the lab and into the home. Ronan Cunningham, the CEO and co-founder of BrainWaveBank stated: \"We founded BrainWaveBank with the goal of transforming the early detection and treatment of devastating cognitive illnesses such as dementia. We are very excited to be supported in achieving this vision by such a strong team of leading technology investors and innovation agencies. This funding allows us to significantly accelerate our technology development and bring our product to market where it can help people live longer, healthier, and more connected lives.\" Tim Mills, Investment Director at the Angel CoFund commented: \"Considerable progress has been made in recent years around the awareness and treatment of issues with cognitive health - but it's clear that the human brain is still the least understood part of the human body. We're backing BrainWaveBank because we believe they have a huge opportunity to advance the fight against dementia and better manage the treatment of impact related concussion, and we're proud to be part of their journey.\" ",

      "content": "The French startup Akeneo has raised $13 million from Partech Ventures and Alven Capital. Akeneo was founded in 2013 and today is the leading provider of open-source product information management (PIM) software, a resource that is becoming increasingly important for companies competing in ecommerce. Headquartered in Nantes, Akeneo has created a collaborative open source platform to optimize product information management. PIM has been likened to customer-relation management (CRM) for products: It brings together detailed, high-quality data about products across sales channels, helping manufacturers and ecommerce companies better manage and market products, improve conversion rates, enhance SEO, and improve productivity. The Akeneo PIM solution also aims to make it possible to scale and customize ecommerce initiatives more rapidly. Akeneo CEO and co-founder Frederic de Gombert stated: \"We work with many brands and distributors that are in the process of moving their operations definitively into the ecommerce world. Our belief is that there cannot be effective and lasting digital transformation if it does not include product data quality as a core focus.\" Akeneo was co-founded by three French entrepreneurs - CEO Frederic de Gombert, engineering lead Nicolas Dupont, and CTO Benoit Jacquemont - and one American, Yoav Kutner. Kutner was a co-founder of Magento, one of the leading global ecommerce platforms, which was purchased by Ebay in 2011. Investor Roy Rubin, a former CEO and co-founder of Magento, also joined the Akeneo board in 2016. Partech Ventures is the majority investor in the new funding round, and it sees strategic PIM as a growing competitive advantage for ecommerce players. Partech partner Reza Malekzadeh stated: \"With the boom of product offers and distribution channels, managing product data is a major issue with a measurable impact on sellers' turnovers. Akeneo's exceptional model, its great international relevance, and the ambitious vision and effective performance of its team have us utterly convinced that it is about to set a new standard on the product data management market.\"  Like Magento, Akeneo adopted an open source model, making the basic version of its software available to anyone free online. Thus far, 40,000 businesses have downloaded the software. The premium version is already being used by more than 120 global brands, including Samsung, Adidas, Universal Music Group, Made.com, Nuxe, and Carrefour. Akeneo plans to use the new funding to double its R&D team and to accelerate international sales. The company has operations in France, the U.S., and Germany. ",

      "content": "There seems to be a general idea behind starting a new business these days. Entrepreneurs young and old, though specially the former, start their companies to be multi-billion dollar organizations, or they don't even hit the ground. They look into the future and see themselves as a mythical figure surrounded by a white aura; they see themselves as Unicorns! Yet, they are only humans. But being a Human, a real creature, is what allows us to do grand things! The problem of wanting to be too big before knowing how to just \"be\" is dangerous when one does not admit to having to go through a very steep learning curve. Aiming to be a mythical figure can lead to a tragic turn of faith, as the vast majority tends to end up like Icarus instead, just because they wanted to fly too high without the proper tools. As I personally see it, this is a situation fueled by different parties. Public Sector: Over the last years the public sector has pushed for entrepreneurship in a last resort attempt to get unemployment under control. \"You can be your own boss\" , \"It has never been easier to open your own company\". This push, though in the right direction, is void of any substance as people are expected to adapt to a new reality even though they are given the old tools by the educational system. Acceleration programs cannot equip an entrepreneur in 3 or 6 months. Under the old model (though still running) one is expected to hold a Master's degree to dream of accessing a repetitive job in a big corporation, but now everyone seems to think that there is no preparation required to launch a project which will need to deliver a product and, eventually, morph into a legal and profitable organization. The public sector must address this problem by pushing for full blown education reforms touching each and every level, starting as early as youngsters get in a \"class room\" which, by the way, does not need to be a classical room with 20 desks and chairs ...nor a room at all. The Private Sector: Big companies should focus in having a more meaningful impact in society and one valid way to do so can easily be through education programs, which in their turn could eventually help Corporations manage their HR requirements on the long term. Still, the mega HR structures have been reducing, mostly after the last crash. Big corporations have found that innovation tends to be from outside, smaller players, that can later be acquired. Taken to an extreme, big corporations stop having well paid R&D positions because they count on the \"low paid\" R&D done and tested by Startups. Intelligent move for corporations but with a serious impact in the job market. Finally, and in the relentless search for cost reduction, automation is taking over. Companies are making big bets in it and , in certain cases, \"inviting\" inviting workers to leave giving them some sort of extra support should the person decide to venture in the SMEs world. Solution Mind-set: We need to prepare people for the new social and economic organization. This is a fantastic new World ahead. Certainly packed with challenges great and small, but still a new World with many new opportunities to explore. We need to give new tools to be used on a planet packed with machines. Schools and universities need to stop preparing people to do what all different robots are destined to do or doing already (eg; certain legal work, new media marketing, etc). We must push for greater use of creativity and development of, unfortunately long lost, social skills. Better social skills lead to civilized discussions which in turn improve the probability of human development and thus way improving the quality of life as well, one hopes at least. Exploring such path is the fantastic work of the entrepreneur. As well, we have to stop shouting out loud that everyone can be an entrepreneur. That is a real as anyone being able to be an astronaut. Lets allow people to make decisions based on real facts. Self criticism is very difficult so lets not make it harder by maintaining people in a bubble. Sometimes, before being a leader it is important to be part of a structure that one does not control. Education: Rooms crammed with children being taught the exact same thing in the exact same way has been failing. We expect society to embrace innovation and change when the building block of it, education, has remained stagnant for centuries (if not millennia). The internet in itself and some of its tools, to the likings of AR and VR, will be the base of this soon to arrive spectacular transformation. So far, the internet, has been working as a repository of information but we are missing the platforms and correct channels to make the higher quality information available with great UX. The technology is out there; the content, on its way. This said, one cant sit and wait. Lets all push for it. Policy: There should not be only one model, as presently. The educational system must be as nimble as the human being. Pre-school, high-school, University + Masters. 18 years of schooling, sometimes for people to go and work on something not related to the University studies (which are mostly demanded by employers). There should be annual general skills assessments per age groups to assure a base that could eventually be: local language, mathematics - as a 2nd language - (reference to Harbour.Space) and then broadening multi-disciplinary knowledge by focusing in a theme of interest and going deep on it. Finland is already doing something very similar. Our Responsibility: Make books available both at home and at work. Implement the 2 or 4 hour reading block on weekends at home. Read the big old classics. If people would have read 1984, Fahrenheit 451 or The Great Gatsby (this one goes for some VCs as well) we would see a lot more respect for people, for real knowledge (not internet snippets of economic theories and what not) and for money. Be consequent. Complaining with no action does not solve problems. Stop complaining as there is almost always an alternative route to the target. If there is no alternative, there is no point in complaining. Move on. Living with our feet in the ground. Nobody else can do it for us. Every now and again we have to look at the path we have been on an adapt. If you are on autopilot you might end up in a road that does not exist anymore. Conclusion Taking all this in consideration, and in little more than 2 lines; I hope that the educational system radically changes but in the meantime entrepreneurs must realize they can become great without growing-up to be an imaginary animal.

During the application process startups from Latvia, Ukraine, Estonia, Romania and Lithuania had been the most active. Out of more than 250 applications, the following 11 teams have been selected: The new SWG program started on March 13th in Tallinn, Estonia - the birth-place of many global startups like Skype, Transferwise and VitalFields. Selected B2B startups have relocated to Tallinn and are going through an intensive 3 month business training, where they work with a pool of over 150 international mentors to shape their business model, build their products, get their first paying customers and sell their ideas to investors. Each startup will also receive seed investment of EUR20K. The Tallinn batch is the 8th SWG accelerator program since 2012, when SWG was founded. December 2016 marked the first exit of SWG portfolio company - Estonia-based startup VitalFields was acquired by a large US corporation. Startup Wise Guys has become the first accelerator in Europe to raise funding for its next program via public equity crowdfunding, thus enabling non-professional investors to easily build a diversified portfolio and disrupting the accelerator funding process as such. Investment was committed by more than 100 investors on Funderbeam platform. ",

It provides aspiring entrepreneurs and young people thinking about starting up with a ton of information and contact details from VCs, angel investors, accelerators, service providers and other players within their local startup scene. The map was created to empower first time entrepreneurs to understand the startup environment not only around them, but throughout Europe, and to help them find the missing piece that enables them to start and grow their business. The MY-WAY team, in which EU-Startups is one of the partners, is continuously updating the map and includes new entities on a regular basis. For the initial launch of the map, the focus was on 10 specific cities only (Berlin, Brussels, Budapest, Dublin, Istanbul, London, Madrid, Milan, Stockholm, Tel-Aviv). But the plan is to really make it a European map and to shine light on all those startup hubs which are not very well documented yet.  Given the large number of vibrant startup hubs in Europe, the team behind MY-WAY is very open to receive hints and suggestions on what organisations to include - especially from smaller startup hubs, since they aren't well represented in the map yet. If you have an addition to the map, please feel free to contact the coordinators of the project via email (coordinator@mywaystartup.eu). ",

      "content": "Every year there's a plethora of conferences, summits and festivals targeting tech startups, established tech companies and investors. It can be difficult to navigate the competing itinerary across Europe so we've put together a list of the best events for maximum impact: TechChill (February- Riga, Latvia)\nProving that good things happen in small packages in the heart of winter, TechChill offers startups an intimate opportunity to network with fellow startups, entrepreneurs, investors, and journalists. There's plenty of side events and it's a great chance to visit a part of the world you might otherwise never see. 4YFN (February to March- Barcelona, Spain)\n4YFN is an initiative by Mobile World Capital Barcelona to facilitate a meeting point for the global technology startups. It's the sister event to the simultaneously held behemoth, Mobile World Congress with tickets and stall prices significantly more affordable. You can expect to rub shoulders with investors, press and analysts looking for the latest successes with the opportunity to attend workshops on topics such as the legal info you need to know post- seed funding and even speed date a slew of journalists. MWC (February to March-Barcelona, Spain)\nMobile World Congress is one of the world's biggest tech conferences (perhaps only CES is bigger). It extends far beyond mobile tech to encompass IoT, AI, hardware and every kind of connected device you could think of, across a massive venue of stalls, stages, and gardens. Wear comfortable shoes, you'll be walking forever, but you never know who you might meet on the travelator. CeBIT Global Conferences (March - Hannover, Germany)\nOnce the world's largest computer trade expo, CeBIT has progressed from its traditional roots into themes such as IoT, R&D and start-up innovation. You can expect to see plenty of panels, keynote speakers, and workshops as well as booths from over 3000 exhibit. Wolves Summit (March - Warsaw, Poland)\nWolves Summit is a conference for startups, investors, corporations and entrepreneurs from all around the world. This year will be the fifth edition of the event, which is one of the biggest startup events in Central and Eastern Europe. Wolves Summit aims to build a bridge between promising startups, tech companies, investors and corporations. Resonate (April - Belgrade, Serbia)\nResonate is a platform for networking, knowledge sharing, and education. It brings together artists, designers, and educators to participate in a forward-looking debate on the position of technology in art and culture. The annual festival lasts for four days and provides an overview of current situation in the fields of music, visual arts, and digital culture. Guest artists, lecturers, and other participants are chosen to represent the cutting edge of the contemporary creative industry in the world. EU-Startups Conference (April - Berlin, Germany) \nThe EU-Startups Conference is the annual flagship event of EU-Startups.com. It connects some of the best European startups with investors, corporates and the media. Aside of exciting speakers, the EU-Startups Conference also hosts a big pitch competition with 15 pre-selected early-stage startups from all across Europe. Arctic15 (May - Helsinki, Finland)\nThe underlying premise of Artic15 is to help startups close deals with investors. Over the years, they've consistently had one of the top investor to startup ratios of any startup conference in the world. With an expected 300 investors and 450 startups, this will also be the case in 2017. Startups encompass a diverse field including health and fintech, IoT, and foodtech. infoShare (May- Gdansk, Poland)\ninfoShare isone of Central and Eastern Europe's biggest tech conferences and provides startups from the region with an opportunity to network with potential investors, future customers and the media. More than 100 VCs and angel investors will be attending along with 120+ speakers from companies like Google, Slack and Netflix, and investment firms such as Inventure, Karma VC and Credo Ventures. The Next Web Conference (May - Amsterdam, The Netherlands)\nThe Next Web conference is perhaps one of the most over-hyped tech events, with good reason. It's a two-day conference bracketed in a week-long festival that includes 7 stages, exhibitors and non-stop opportunities for engaging with the tech leaders, VC's and entrepreneurs of around the world. Latitude59 (May - Tallinn, Estonia)\nEveryone interested in tech should visit Estonia to see how the country has transformed itself into a tech leader since the fall of communism. Latitude is a great excuse, with the tech conference encompassing a great array of future tech topics including smart cities, blockchain and digital health. Pioneers Festival (June- Vienna, Austria)\nPioneers is something of a niche festival with only 2500 participants along with a hit list of executives, investors, and journalists, many of whom are visiting from North America. If you are wanting to expose your startup to American minds without visiting San Fran or New York, this is a good opportunity, especially for hardware startups. The Europas (June - London, UK)\nThe Europas are an award show for Europe's hottest tech startups. While it concentrates on the newest companies on the scene, it also brings together the mid and late stage technology startups, as well as leading investors and media in the EMEA region. The event celebrates the most forward thinking, progressive and innovative tech companies across over some 20+ categories. Bitspiration (June - Krakow, Poland)\nBitspiration demonstrates amply that a small no-frills conference largely run by volunteers can be highly successful with an enthusiastic attending community of startups, tech enthusiasts, and creatives with investors, corporations and experts. You can expect to get easy access to press and investors, and international experts- there's no velvet rope here. Tech Open Air (July - Berlin, Germany)\nTOA is a weird kind of conference that encompasses tech, art and science but somehow works. Last year's conference was held in an old DDR radio station accessible by ferry. You can expect a community of top-tier entrepreneurs, artists and scientists visiting Berlin for three days of keynotes, pitches, live music and art installations in a bustling atmosphere. Bits and Pretzels (September- Munich, Germany)\nA startup conference to coincide with Oktoberfest? Yes, please! Bits & Pretzels is a 3-day founders festival that connects 5000 startup enthusiasts with speakers as diverse as Richard Branson and Kevin Spacey. Organisers make a concerted effort to build relationships between founders, investors and the media and you might find yourself drinking beer and wearing lederhosen as you pitch your latest idea. European Pirate Summit (September- Cologne, Germany)\nIf you're the kind of person that likes to be focused on success this might be the event for you. It's Europe's largest invitation-only conference for early-stage startups, investors, and corporate executives. But it's not just sitting watching another person with their powerpoint presentation, ever seen someone pitch whilst walking the plank? DLD Tel Aviv Innovation Festival (September- Tel Aviv, Israel)\nDLD is a week-long festival that includes not only a smart cities conference (great for IoT startups) but also a makers' zone, pitching comp, CEO's available for questions and loads of opportunities for networking. SaaStock (September-Dublin, Ireland)\nSaaStock is a gathering of global SaaS companies (Founders, Executives & Investors) in Europe, enabling the community to learn from the SaaS trail-blazers and from one another. SaaStock 2017 will be the biggest conference in Europe for global SaaS companies of all stages to meet and network. If you want to build your sales pipeline, build B2B Saas empires and meet with SaaS investors, then SaaStock is the place to be. Social Media Week London (September 13-16, London, United Kingdom)\nSocial Media Week London is one of the premiere digital media conferences in the region. The event brings together some of the industry's leading brands and individuals at the intersection of entertainment, media, marketing, and technology. Nordic Startup Awards Grand Finale (October 20, Stockholm, Sweden)\nThe Nordic Startup Awards is basically a series of national startup competitions across the Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden that culminates in a finale that is judged by a curated jury of seasoned entrepreneurs, business people, and investors. Categories of awards include the best startup, investor, CTO and investment company - and you can self-nominate for the awards in your country. South Summit (October - Madrid, Spain)\nSouth Summit is probably Spain's leading event around innovation, with more than 12.500 attendees from more than 100 nationalities. Each year it connects the most innovative entrepreneurs with the most important investors from around the world. It also hosts a big startup competition. Slush (November - Helsinki, Finland)\nSlush is a conference \"built for entrepreneurs by entrepreneurs\". In the last five years, it's grown into one of the biggest events for startups in the Nordics. It's not only an opportunity for networking at a time of year when most people are winding down, but it also includes one-on-one meetings with journalists and investors, stalls, and a massive pitching competition. Web Summit (November- Lisbon, Portugal)\nWeb Summit is infamous for its size and scope with over 50,000 attendees, and over 15,000 companies. The largest tech and business convention in Europe. Web Summit 2016 is kicking off in Lisbon today. There are 53,000 attendees, 15,000 companies, and over 166 countries represented. It doesn't end at night either, there's also a night summit held in bars around the city where the real business deals happen. TechCrunch Disrupt Europe (December - Berlin, Germany)\nTechCrunch's Disrupt event in Europe gathers a slew of top entrepreneurs, investors, and hackers to discuss industry trends, introduce new technologies and offer emerging startups the chance to launch their product or service. The program includes on-stage interviews, the Startup Battlefield competition, a 24-hour Hackathon, Startup Alley, Hardware Alley, and After Parties. General conference tips for startups It's easy to spend most of the summer flitting around Europe on budget airlines to attend a multitude of startup conferences in a haze of lanyard-wearing, cheap booze and being talked at for hours in a bubble of self-congratulating peers when you really should be working on your platform or hardware back home. To make your attendance effective you need to look at the events scheduled over a calendar and carefully consider how each specific conference meets your needs and where it fits into your company timeline.

Within just two years of its 2015 product launch, N26 has evolved from an emerging FinTech to become a fully-licensed bank operating in 17 markets in the EU. N26 is available to more than 99% of the Eurozone population and has users of 206 different nationalities. The FinTech startup aims to offer its mobile banking experience to all Europeans within the next few years. Founded by Maximilian Tayenthal and Valentin Stalf, N26 has processed more than three billion Euros in transaction volume. More than 60% of that was processed in 2016 and signifies a evenfold increase from the year before. N26 card transactions exceeded 10 million in the past year. Currently, more than 1.900 N26 card transactions are done every hour. N26 attributes its rapid success to its mobile-first technology which enables the innovative features that define the company. Valentin Stalf, founder and CEO of N26 stated: \"January and February 2017 were the strongest months in terms of customer growth in our company's history, We are on track to grow to a couple of million customers over the next years.

The three-day event provides startups from the region with an opportunity to network with potential investors, future customers and the media. More than 100 VCs and angel investors will be attending along with 120+ speakers from companies like Google, Slack and Netflix, and investment firms such as Inventure, Karma VC and Credo Ventures. Grzegorz Borowski, the CEO of infoShare Foundation explains: \"We see both - startups looking for investors and VCs/CVCs searching for new businesses to invest in. They just need to be there at the right place and the right time to find each other. infoShare is the spot where they connect. Last year 80% of startups talked to investors during the event and 60% of the talks continued afterwards.\" The exhibition allows startups to present and show off their products and services to an interested crowd of techies and potential customers. In 2016, more than 200 startups took part in the expo and this year more than 5,000 people are expected to walk through the doors of the event per day.

      "content": "Sourcing the right talent for the job is one requirement for developing any venture, but creating the right opportunity for the right talent is something more. In a complex scenario of nurturing international talents in an educational setting CEU's Institute for Entrepreneurship and Innovation created its own response for the diverse student base and project requirements the university deals with. I had a good discussion with Judit Hildegard Hajos, Executive Director of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project, Director of External Relations at CEU, based in Budapest. Peter: You say \"nurturing talent to meet opportunity is just as important as the opposite notion to nurture opportunities for meeting the talent.\" What do you mean on that? Judit: Besides talent, there are multiple ingredients necessary for success like timing, bearing of responsibility, pace, courage, integrity, smart thinking, supporting ecosystem, willpower and a bit of leap in faith. None of these ingredients are tangible therefore they are rather determined by the environment the individual's response.\" In addition, a flexible give and take and a ready to change attitude is often the right base for growth. Vibrant communities have a thing in common: the best behavior is free to be copied, the right mindset is tested and adaptable and the rest is depending on the power of the network. It is worth to be at an open organization since for any phase of development it is certain that somebody has been there, has done that or similar and ready to share the experience. In our view, complexity, diversity and boldness is celebrated for boosting creativity but only in the framework of business integrity which is amongst CEU's core values. Peter: And what are your actions at CEU to get there? Judit: The talent economy is a fair economy because it is free. All lessons, examples, leads are open to anyone to follow. Students and ventures are reaching out to multiple directions according to their needs and we have the special knowledge to see what is given at the market, tapping strategic interests, almost tailor made consultations to match opportunity with talent (supply and demand) with an honest assessment of pros and cons, a clear communication respecting the multiple mentalities re valuations, that along the constant value analyses, some visible activities are also boosting opportunities, like: 1. direct access of international professors and professional staff for mentoring and sponsoring, 2. accessible market / tech / practical knowledge, 3. New York Module (students directly access trends and latest mindset on spot at NYC), 4. unique partnership agreements and the CEU iLab gives space for in-door startups - these are just a few to mention which are to be leveraged the best according to my experiences. On the top of that, dealing with the market in a safe academic environment and testing ideas is ideal at this geography, it makes us aware of the importance of social innovation, social entrepreneurship. Peter: How can you feed opportunities from the region to business savvy progress? Do you have a recipe? Judit: There is certainly the choice to dare and try, a startup at our iLab called AbsoRice has a real story how to turn the CEU opportunity to reality along with Talk-A-Bot. Both ventures have been recently featured by the Hungarian Forbes as interesting case studies on \"CEE ventures with a wit and some well-planned luck\". They all stem from a story of a real CEU combo including winning a NASDAQ scholarship, pursuing their MBA studies with good action learning challenges, participating at the New York Module and well using our live networks and the positive organizational support. We assume this all sounds good as a glokal strategy. (To learn more about our programs, please visit our website.) Entrepreneurs must focus on know-how and growth to become successful. As and advice I'd like to quote Justine Musk (Elon Musk's wife): \"The world doesn't throw a billion dollars at a person because the person wants it or works so hard they feel they deserve it. (The world does not care what you want or deserve.) The world gives you money in exchange for something it perceives to be of equal or greater value: something that transforms an aspect of the culture, reworks a familiar story or introduces a new one, alters the way people think about the category and make use of it in daily life.\" Peter: Thanks a lot for your time and insights!

Despite the many challenges, the startup scene in Switzerland is pushing forward at a very rapid pace. The increasing amount of accelerators, incubators, investor platforms and rankings such as The Best Swiss Startups clearly demonstrate that there is no lack of drive. Here's our list of 10 Swiss startups we recommend keeping a close eye on this year.

      "content": "Fanmiles, the loyalty-tech startup known through its investor, Philipp Lahm (Bayern Munchen), successfully concluded its next financing round. The Berlin-based company gathered EUR2.7 million fresh capital in a Pre-Series A round valueing the company at about EUR30 million. The round was backed by the Philipp Lahm Holding, the Berlin-based Auden AG and business angels.  Fanmiles was founded in 2013 by Fabian Schmidt and Alan Sternberg and is jointly managed with Vamos CTO Jens Dressler since the acquisition of the event discovery app. The company's mission is to provide forward-thinking businesses with the technology and currency to create and manage their own loyalty programs. Fanmiles will use the fresh capital for further growth, especially to expand its tech departments as well as the international partner network from its Berlin headquarters. Moreover, the product and the technology platform have been further optimized - in addition to soccer stars that reward their fans with loyalty campaigns on Facebook, native integrations are now also possible via the first open developer program in the field of loyalty technology. Current customers include Sport1, Intersport, ESL (Electronic Sports League), CineStar, Adidas, EA Games, as well as the soccer league teams FC Schalke 04, Hertha BSC und Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Besides achieving milestones such as the acquisition of the app Vamos and the Fanmiles app launch right in time for the European championship in 2016, Fanmiles now aims to become the leading global open loyalty ecosystem. In addition to social media loyalty campaigns of renowned soccer stars, the Fanmiles developer program enables companies of every size to equip loyalty solutions and programs with the globally valid and open loyalty currency #fanmiles. This will enable users to collect #fanmiles for their activities and loyalty among multiple partners all over the world that can thereafter be redeemed for exclusive and attractive rewards within the entire partner network. It is Fanmiles' vision to become the forerunner currency for loyalty programs and solutions and to thereby provide business partners and developers with a lasting opportunity to invest directly into the retention of their users.  Fanmiles founder Fabian Schmidt stated: \"Knowing your clients and holding on to them are fundamental requirements for the success of an enterprise. Since the acquisition of a new customer is five times as expensive as holding on to an existing client, customer retention should be the main focus of all marketing activities. Fanmiles offers companies the first platform through which customer retention may be achieved by investing in simple native integration. Thereby, a 5% increase in customer retention can increase profit by 95%.\" Thanks to its developers program, Fanmiles can be universally and globally integrated into all channels, apps and services (e.g. online and offline shops). At this, Fanmiles differs from conventional, closed bonus programs or solutions, that cover a limited choice of partners. CTO Jens Dressler said: \"With Fanmiles, we want to create a worlwide applicable loyalty currency, that can be easily and scalably used  by developers, loyalty programs and loyalty providers. By cooperating with third party developers or platforms, we open Fanmiles as loyalty currency to guarantee a partner comprehensive app ecosystem.\" ",

      "content": "America's manufacturing heyday is gone, and so are millions of jobs, lost to modernization. A new report from PwC estimates that 38% of American jobs are at \"high risk\" of being replaced by technology within the next 15 years.  How soon automation will replace workers is not the real problem. The real threat to American jobs will come if China does it first. [This article, written by Nikolaus Correll, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder, is excerpted and republished with permission from Robohub.org.] Since 2000, the U.S. has lost five million manufacturing jobs. An estimated 2.4 million jobs went to low-wage workers in China and elsewhere between 1999 and 2011. The remainder fell victim to gains in efficiency of production and automation, making many traditional manufacturing jobs obsolete. Though more than a million jobs have returned since the 2008 recession, the net loss has devastated the lives of millions of people and their families. Some blame robotics, others globalization. It turns out that those forces work together, and have been equally hurtful to manufacturing jobs. The car industry, for example, imports more and more parts from abroad, while automating their assembly in the U.S. In 2014, China exported more, and more valuable, products than the U.S. for the first time. Many of these were made by the low-wage laborers China has become famous for. Yet China has also emerged as the largest growth market for robotics. Chinese companies bought more than twice as many industrial robots (68,000) in 2015 than American companies did (27,000). China's Midea - an appliance manufacturer - just purchased the German robot manufacturing powerhouse Kuka. China has understood that its competitive advantage of cheap labor will not last forever. Instead, labor costs will rise as its economy develops. Look at FoxConn, for example, the Taiwanese manufacturing contractor of the iPhone known for the high-pressure work environment at its plants in China. The company already uses more than 60,000 robots, and has said it wants to use as many as a million robots by 2020. That's a bold goal, especially given the current state of robotics. At present, robots are good only at highly repetitive tasks in structured environments. They are still far inferior to humans in simple tasks like picking items from a shelf. But FoxConn's goal of transforming its streamlined manufacturing line is definitely achievable. Many of the tasks now done by humans thousands of times a day can be easily automated - such as applying a puddle of glue, placing double-sided tape, positioning a piece of plastic, tightening screws or loading products onto a pallet. The lesson here is simple: Some occupations will simply disappear, like those of weavers in the textile industry displaced by the power loom. We need to embrace this disruption if we want to avoid being taken out of the game altogether. Imagine if China is able to replace our low-wage jobs with its workers, and then can automate those jobs: Work Americans now do will be done here, or anywhere - but not by humans. FoxConn is planning its first plant in the U.S.; soon, Chinese robots will be working in America. The good news is that while many types of jobs will cease to exist, robots will create other jobs - and not only in the industry of designing new robots. This is already beginning to happen. In 2014, there were more than 350,000 manufacturing companies with only one employee, up 17 percent from 2004. These companies combine globalization and automation, embracing outsourcing and technological tools to make craft foods, artisanal goods and even high-tech engineered products. Many American entrepreneurs use digitally equipped manufacturing equipment like 3-D printers, laser cutters and computer-controlled CNC mills, combined with market places to outsource small manufacturing jobs like mfg.com to run small businesses. I'm one of them, manufacturing custom robotic grippers from my basement. Automation enables these sole proprietors to create and innovate in small batches, without large costs. This sort of solo entrepreneurship is just getting going. Were robots more available and cheaper, people would make jewelry and leather goods at home, and even create custom-made items like clothing or sneakers, directly competing with mass-produced items from China. As with the iPhone, even seemingly complex manufacturing tasks can be automated significantly; it's not even necessary to incorporate artificial intelligence into the process. Three trends are emerging that, with industry buy-in and careful government support, could help revitalize the U.S. manufacturing sector. We need to improve connections between researchers and businesses. Government effort, in the form of the Defense Department's new Advanced Robotics Manufacturing Institute, is already working toward this goal. Funded by US$80 million in federal dollars, the institute has drawn an additional $173 million in cash, personnel, equipment and facilities from the academic and private sectors, aiming to create half a million manufacturing jobs in the next 10 years. Those numbers might sound high, but China is way ahead: Just two provinces, Guangdong and Zhejiang, plan to spend a combined $270 billion over the next five years to equip factories with industrial robots. The stakes are high: If the U.S. government ignores or avoids globalization and automation, it will stifle innovation. Americans can figure out how to strengthen society while integrating robotics into the workforce, or we can leave the job to China. Should it come to that, Chinese companies will be able to export their highly efficient manufacturing and logistics operations back to the U.S., putting America's manufacturing workforce out of business forever. As a robotics researcher and educator, I strongly advocate that the best way to get those jobs back and remain globally competitive is to build on our existing strengths, remaining a leader in manufacturing efficiency and doing the hard work to further improve our educational and social systems to cope with a changing workforce. << Return to The Robot Report Robohub is a non-profit online communication platform that brings together experts in robotics research, start-ups, business, and education from across the globe.

Baidu's AI group has expanded to over 1,300 people in China and Silicon Valley. Ng, who has been with Baidu since 2014 oversaw most of that change. Some see Ng's departure as a setback to their AI efforts, hence the shakeup in the stock price. Others comment that the timing was right both for him and for Baidu. Ng blogged about his resignation that: I will be resigning from Baidu, where I have been leading the company's AI Group. Baidu's AI is incredibly strong, and the team is stacked up and down with talent; I am confident AI at Baidu will continue to flourish. After Baidu, I am excited to continue working toward the AI transformation of our society and the use of AI to make life better for everyone. In January, Lu Qi, an AI exec from Microsoft, was hired as COO which included oversight of Baidu's AI research and business. Today he announced Ng's replacement as head of AI Group to be Wang Haifeng, also an AI expert, and previous president of the Association for Computational Linguistics, an international scientific and professional society for people working on computational problems involving human language. One analyst, Kitty Fok, from IDC, a provider of research, consulting and events for the data and telecom industries, said of Ng's choice to leave Baidu: He wants to start his own company. Ng saw a golden opportunity to become an entrepreneur. It's perfect timing for him because he has the expertise, he's well known in his field, and interest is high for innovative tech start-ups. I wouldn't be surprised if Baidu, Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group would be interested in investing in Ng's potential new AI enterprise. << Return to The Robot Report Frank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global(tm) Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "The International Federation of Robotics forecast that unit shipments for the global market for vacuum cleaning robots, lawn-mowing robots and other household cleaning robots will grow at a CAGR of 33% through 2019. Other research reports say revenue for the market will reach $2.5 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 15%. America's biggest provider, iRobot, in their earnings disclosure delivered this week, reported very strong sales in the United States; 2016 sales were up more than 35% over a record 2015. Total units shipped in fiscal 2015 were 2,436,000 compared to 2,174,000 units in fiscal 2014. International shipments in 2015 represented 10.77% of revenue but increased only 1.5% over 2014. No unit data was released for fiscal 2016.  iRobot's stock steadily doubled over the last 12 months but took a $7 dive on the date of the earnings report. The increase in domestic home robots revenue was primarily attributable to increased sales as a result of significant investments in advertising media and national promotions as well as the launch of Roomba 980. International home robots revenue growth slowed compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of negative macroeconomic conditions, specifically in Japan and Russia, offset by a significant growth increase in China. iRobot is eyeing Asia for growth and recently launched a $290 Braava jet mopping robot customized for China. iRobot has also acquired the iRobot related distribution business of privately-held Sales On Demand Corporation (SODC) based in Tokyo, Japan. The acquisition, which is expected to close in April 2017, will enable iRobot to get closer to Japanese consumers and retail partners, and thus allow the company to better address Japanese market needs. Mother's Day, Father's Day and, in China, Singles Day are all big shopping holidays. Singles Day is held on November 11th (11/11). [November 11 was chosen for the annual holiday because no other date has as many 1's, or \"singles\".] On that date in 2016 Ecovacs popular robot vacuum Deebot outsold TVs to emerge as the top-selling home electronic appliance on Tmall, a business-to-customer platform of Alibaba, the online sales network. Ecovacs reported that their online sales exceeded $47 million which equates to approximately 188,000 units. David Qian, who is in charge of Ecovacs' international business, said: \"After decades of development, the household robot industry is, in fact, still in its infancy. Future domestic robots will become multifunctional. Just cleaning floors will be not enough.\" \"China's swelling middle class has a rising demand for domestic cleaning, home security and surveillance robots,\" said Luo Jun, CEO of the Asian Manufacturing Association. \"Robots can make doing housework interesting and cool,\" said Liu De, co-founder and vice-president of Xiaomi. As a consequence, both domestic and foreign enterprises are scrambling to participate in the market. Chinese home appliance firms such as Haier Group and TCL Corp are eyeing the market with similar products, making the market increasingly crowded. Chinese smartphone vendor Xiaomi Corp launched a smart vacuum cleaner last September. Priced at $246, the machine is equipped with 12 sensors and a central processing unit. Instead of bouncing around the room and haphazardly picking up debris, Xiaomi said it can automatically measure the size of the room and map the best routes to do cleaning.  iRobot is planning to quadruple its presence in the Chinese market after setting up its Chinese headquarters in Shanghai last September.  \"The global household robots market is growing about 25 percent annually, but in China, the growth rate is close to 70 or 100 percent,\" said Colin Angle, chairman and CEO of iRobot. Prominent companies besides Ecovacs and iRobot operating in the market are Dyson Ltd., Infinuvo, Koninklijke Philips N.V., LG Electronics Inc., Neato Robotics Inc., Intellibot Robotics, Yujin Robot, and Samsung Electronics to name just a few. At CES in Las Vegas in January, one could see that the current consumer products fad seems to have shifted gears from big TVs to robots. CES may well become the goto tradeshow for consumer oriented robotic start-ups. Smart devices for the home offering compatibility with Amazon's Alexa, Google Home and Apple's HomeKit were all crowd pleasers but one could see Amazon everywhere. By opening up their Alexa Voice Service, it's now being integrated into cars (Ford, VW), smartphones (Huawei), robot vacuums (LG), remotes (DirectTV) and LG refrigerators. Voice activation that works - as Amazon's Alexa and Siri are proving - is becoming real and offers a new selling point for techies and other early adopters of robotic vacuums and other home products. << Return to The Robot Report Frank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global(tm) Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "In President-elect Trump's interview with the NY Times yesterday, when discussing jobs, closed factories and factories that may leave the country, he was asked: \"Are you worried that those companies will keep their factories here, but the jobs will be replaced by robots? Trump responded as follows: (transcript from NY Times) They will, and we'll make the robots too. It's a big thing, we'll make the robots too. Right now we don't make the robots. We don't make anything. But we're going to, I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we're going to do that. We're going to have more factories. We can't lose 70,000 factories. Just can't do it. We're going to start making things.   I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.' I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' But we're going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you're liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It's gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can't, they can't even start up, they can't expand, they're choking.   I tell you, one thing I would say, so, I'm giving a big tax cut and I'm giving big regulation cuts, and I've seen all of the small business owners over the United States, and all of the big business owners, I've met so many people. They are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut. And I would've never said that's possible, because the tax cut's going to be substantial. You know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high. But they're leaving also because of the regulations. And I would say, of the two, and I would not have thought this, regulation cuts, substantial regulation cuts, are more important than, and more enthusiastically supported, than even the big tax cuts. It's true that 2/3 of the robotics industry and 100% of industrial robots are manufactured outside of the U.S. by non-U.S. companies. The industrial robot industry was started in America but the companies making those original robots were sold and moved off shore, never to return except in the form of sales and service offices and research and support centers. [Adept Technologies, the last American industrial robot manufacturer, was sold last year to Japanese industrial components and robot manufacturer OMRON.]  In China, Japan, Korea and throughout the EU, governments are providing significant credits and incentives to make (or in the EU and Japan, to keep) robot-making in-country. These are strategic investments of billions and billions of dollars. It's having a good effect worldwide. For example, China's in-country robot production rate is growing exponentially. Yet thus far in America, through the American Manufacturing Initiative and other measures, less than $100 million has been earmarked for robotics and less than $50 million towards manufacturing them in the U.S. Let's hope that Trump does what he says he's going to do regarding robots and robotics in America. << Return to The Robot Report Frank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global(tm) Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Each year the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) surveys and tabulates data from its worldwide network of robotics associations. The two 2016 annual World Robotics Industrial Robots and World Robotics Service Robots reports represent the IFR's analysis of 2015 results. By the end of 2019 there will be around 2.6 million industrial robots at work around the world - one million more robots than in 2015. That reflects a compounded annual growth rate of 12%. 70% of those robots work in the auto, electrical/electronics and metal/machinery industries. In 2015, growth occurred in the electronics industry, which boasted an 18% rise; the metal industry posted an increase of 16%, with the automotive sector growing by 10%. Worldwide sales of industrial robots set a new record in 2015: 254,000 units sold; 12% more than 2014. 66,700 units sold in China of which 20,400 were made in China. The IFR didn't provide sales values for industrial robots (I guess we'll have to buy the book). Asia is the strongest growth market with 156,000 units for the region, a 16% increase over 2014, but that figure is much lower than the 27% projected. The rate of growth of China-made robots penetrating the market also didn't grow at the projected rate but it did grow at a healthy 31% rate. Slower but smarter.  With three national 10-year plans, the current one entitled \"Made in China 2025,\" Beijing is attempting to stimulate the in-country robotics industry on two levels: that manufacturers use robots to increase their productivity and global competitiveness and as robot and robotic components manufacturers to reduce the amount of foreign purchases of robots. This national plan applies to service robots too. The IFR suggested that the trends fueling this steady increase of robot installations will be led by the collaboration of humans and machines, simplified applications, and lightweight and relatively portable robots. Two-armed robots, mobile solutions and the integration of robots into existing environments will also contribute as will an increased focus on modularity and lower overall prices.   The total number of professional service robots sold in 2015 rose by 25% to 41,060 units; up from 32,939 in 2014. The sales value increased by 14% to $4.6 billion. The IFR is projecting that during the period 2016 through 2019, about 333,000 units will be sold with a value of $23.1 billion - a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10%: 5.4 million service robots for personal and domestic use were sold in 2015, 16% more than in 2014. Sales increased by 4% to $2.2 billion. [Note: Service robots for personal and domestic use are recorded separately as their unit value is generally only a fraction of that of many types of service robots for professional use. Personal service robots are produced for a mass market with completely different pricing and marketing channels.] The IFR is projecting that during the period 2016 through 2019, about 42 million units will be sold with a value of $22.3 billion - a 40% CAGR: The combined professional and personal service robotics segment is currently dominated by 43% European, 37% North American and 20% Asian producers. The composure of start-ups in the service robotics sector, however, is quite different. Quoting from the IFR's press release: \"It is interesting to see the rising number of start-ups in this relatively new market. Around 620 companies have been identified.

However, this isn't realistic at the moment. If you want a strong robotic device, you need decent motors which are heavy and expensive. If you have strong motors, you need decent power, but batteries are also heavy, take up room, and they won't last for hours. So, your suit can't be light. For the exoskeleton in the Iron Man movies to exist in reality a number of technologies will need to advance and improve. The ultimate exoskeleton is dependent upon the progression of these other technologies. \"My 2 cents about the exoskeleton/prostheses market is less on rehab and enabling the disabled, but instead on augmenting either in full (skeletons) or in part (gloves, fingers, feet, legs),\" said Frank Tobe, Editor for The Robot Report. \"The disabled market is difficult whereas worker augmentation represents big money - the gloves alone could be a multi-billion dollar business very soon.\" \"For example, General Motors, which has been trying to adapt their NASA Robonaut hand to factory worker assistance, has partnered with BioServo Technologies, who developed a therapeutic glove, to make a factory-worker glove for workers who regularly grasp things. There are many other glove makers doing the same thing. Another example is Japan's health ministry through Cyberdyne and other agencies attempting to empower seniors with exoskeletons to help them garden (squatting, reaching, kneeling and lifting) and be mobile with non-medical partial skeletons. Many university labs are working on variations on this,\" said Frank. \"I don't see how it makes sense to give people super-human powers, aside from improving endurance (when carrying loads - HULC is an example),\" said Maciej Pietrusinski, President and Founder for AndrosRobotics. \"We already have examples of exoskeletons (non-antropomorphic) which give people the ability to traverse the landscape and cover 150 km in 2 hours (bicycle), and it does so without exposing our bodies to harm (except when we fall off the bike). \"An exoskeleton that is meant to give us faster-running abilities would also subject our body to injury. Our bones get stronger with time as they are subject to higher stresses, partially as a response to our muscles growing stronger as we mature, and donning an exoskeleton to give us super-human speed or strength could result in an injury. So empowering the disabled is a much better use of exoskeletons,\" said Maciej. \"These technologies are about restoring functionality to the human body,\" said Samantha. \"They are robotic tools designed to offer a greater degree of independence and a higher quality of life to people who are differently able. However, some of these devices enhance or go beyond the abilities of the human body. For example, some of the new bionic wrists will be able to turn 360 degrees. This is an interesting area of augmentation and indicative of future artificial limbs that will go beyond merely offering to restore functionality.\" Restoring functionality and living \"as a normal two armed person\" is what amputee Melissa Loomis states, in an interview on Motherboard. The technology being looked at called Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL), interprets and converts signals from the body's nervous system to motion. When the MPF interacts with an object, signals from over 100 sensors sends info back to the brain, creating a sense of touch. The pay-off is that Melissa will be able to access sensory information in her prosthetic. The arm learns how to understand what you want to do, as opposed to, you learning how to control the arm.

      "content": "PrecisionAg's editor Eric Sfiligoj has prepared a list of the top 10 technologies that are shaping precision ag today. Most involve some level of robotics, navigation, sensors and variable rate dispensing. Check them out! Republished with permission from PrecisionAg - Meister Media Worldwide It's hard to tell exactly where the state of precision agriculture today would be without GPS -- literally. From virtually the moment agriculture gained access to position locating satellites in the 1990s, operators and manufacturers have found various ways to tie into these tools to make managing field work much easier and accurate. \"In North America and Europe, growers can turn on the tractor and get to work almost immediately,\" says T.J. Schulte, Marketing Manager for Trimble Agriculture Division. Looking beyond these capabilities, experts say that satellite technology is truly deserving of its \"global\" moniker. \"No longer can we refer to all these systems as GPS -- that's not an accurate description when referring to new Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receiver technology today,\" says Greg Guyette, President of Insero. Instead, he adds, GNSS covers all countries' satellite constellations including GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo. After figuring out where precision agriculture stands on the planet, the next most important innovation these past 20 years would have to be the development of mobile devices. The world today would be an entirely different place without them, according to Illinois Grower John Reifsteck. \"Without the cell phone, we probably would still be sitting in the barn a lot, waiting for someone to come to the barn and make things work,\" says Reifsteck. Today, cell phones have morphed into a whole host of useful mobile devices including smartphones and tablets. So ingrained has this technology become that experts estimate that there are more mobile devices on today -- 7.25 billion -- than people (around 7.2 billion). As of 2016, most precision agriculture manufacturers that dabble in the mobile devices market have spent most of their time trying to expand the capabilities these products can offer to users. \"We run our business on the 20-minute rule when it comes to getting information to the user,\" says Dr. Marina Barnes, Vice President of Marketing for FarmersEdge. \"If you can't get your technical data to work for the farmer within the first 20 minutes after he receives it, he's probably never going to use it.\" Robots are taking on many tasks in agriculture these days (with varying levels of success), including planting greenhouse crops and pruning vineyards. And there's been no shortage of activity in agronomic crops. The biggest push has been for autonomous machines that are remotely controlled using telematics. Kinze engineers have created an autonomous grain cart system (designed to plug into any tractor) in which the cart follows a combine through the field at safe distance. Launched in 2011, AGCO's Fendt Guide Connect leader-follower technology also connects two machines by means of GNSS signal and radio, so that both can be controlled by just one driver. AGCO is continuing to develop the concept based on customers' input on their farming needs, says Sepp Nuscheler, Fendt Senior Communications Manager at AGCO. In a different approach, the Fendt MARS (Mobile Agricultural Robot Swarms) project utilizes small corn seeding robots that are lightweight, energy-efficient, highly agile, cloud-controlled and operated from a tablet app. There's no cab but one off-field operator managing a fleet of multiple MARS units. They can work around the clock and have low maintenance needs. \"Look for some exciting developments to be shared on the MARS project in Q4 of this year,\" says Nuscheler. \"This is one direction we see the future of ag robotics heading -- small but smart and many.\" Innovations in precision irrigation technologies are growing even more crucial as growers face water scarcity due to drought, aquifer depletion, and water allocations. One recent advance is telemetry, says John Campbell, Manager of Technology Advancement and Adoption with Valley Irrigation. Products now allow growers to remotely monitor and control nearly every facet of their irrigation operation. The systems save water, time, fuel, and wear and tear on vehicles. In the future, Campbell says producers will be integrating soil moisture monitoring, weather data and variable-rate irrigation (VRI) into their systems. Ze'ev Barylka, Director of Marketing and Sales at Netafim USA, adds Precision Mobile Drip Irrigation as another major advance. PC dripline is pulled through the field by a center pivot or linear move irrigation system. As the driplines are pulled behind the system, the integrated emitters deliver a uniform pattern across the full length of the irrigated area. Because the driplines deliver water directly to the soil surface, evaporation and wind drift are virtually eliminated, allowing more water to reach the root zone. One of the newest buzzwords to hit precision over the past few of years is the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT). Simply defined, it's the concept of connecting any device with an on/off switch to the Internet (and/or to each other). This network of connected things could also include people with wearable devices. The idea has been demonstrated in the consumer market in the \"connected home,\" for instance, where appliances, security systems, and the like communicate with each other and the homeowner. Craig Houin, Data Management Lead at Sunrise Cooperative, says connected components in agriculture could include field sensors (for logging real-time weather, soil moisture, and temperature data) and aerial/satellite imagery for field monitoring. Such device communications could also be used in dispatching programs, sales interaction tools, and other business management applications. Most recently, a number of ag start-ups and component suppliers (hardware, software, etc.) are using LPWANs (Low Power Wide Area Network) in place of or to augment cellular networks in wireless data transmission. \"These networks are designed to carry small amounts of data transmitted intermittently over long ranges,\" says Paul Welbig, Director of Business Development at Senet Inc. Because the devices that communicate with the LPWA networks do so with very low power, their battery lives are substantially longer than the current cellular offerings. This coupled with low cost network usage provides a very compelling total cost of ownership advantage over other options. Wireless sensors have been used in precision ag and/to gather data on soil water availability, soil compaction, soil fertility, leaf temperature, leaf area index, plant water status, local climate data, insect-disease-weed infestation, and more. Perhaps the most advanced and diverse technologies to date are found in water management. Across the country, increased regulation of water use and water scarcity will continue to drive improvements in this area. In fact, BCA Ag Technologies' Ben Flansburg says soil moisture and rainfall sensors have been some big sellers. And many more producers in California are using moisture sensors to help irrigation scheduling. On-the-go sensor information has become more valuable as well. On-board applicator options developed over the past few years include GreenSeeker (Trimble), OptRx (Ag Leader), and CropSpec (Topcon). They communicate real-time crop health conditions to help immediately tailor product applications. Another innovation? WeedSeeker, Trimble's weed detection sensor made for precise site-specific application of herbicides. \"Its use is growing in geographic regions where weeds have developed a tolerance to standard glyphosate-based broad spectrum herbicides,\" notes Mike Martinez, Marketing Director. Given all the newer/exciting technologies for precision agriculture on this list, it might be a surprise to see variable-rate application (VRA) seeding here. According to Sid Parks, Manager of Precision Farming for GROWMARK, this has been able to maintain its importance in part because of its nature. \"It appeals to a growers' natural inclination to try to maximize a field to take advantage of all of the possibilities of increasing the yields possible by paying extra attention to the factors that impact seed growth,\" says Parks. \"It's a little different than variable-rate fertilizer because VRA seeding relies on your ability to gather accurate data for the start of the agricultural process, the seed itself.\" Another factor working in VRA seeding's continued importance to overall precision agriculture is the fact it as a category has plenty of room to grow. \"Although folks have been using VRA seeding practices since the mid-1990s, it still is probably only being used on 5% to 10% of the planted acres today,\" says Parks. \"But the ability to gather good, useful data for VRA seeding is getting much better, so the chances of more growers using this practice in their yearly operations will continue to improve going forward.\" Visit most of the nation's ag retail locations and chances are some kind of weather tracker will be on display. Perhaps no other variable is as important -- and completely unpredictable -- as the weather. But help is on the way. \"Over the past 25 years, you've gotten a lot of important technologies developed that would be even more valuable with quality weather modeling, but we are now at a point where assuring good crop yields is key to making certain the world has food solutions that work,\" says Jeff Keiser, Vice President of Strategic Sales and Marketing for Iteris. \"Here at Iteris, we've been in the data modeling business for more than 30 years. Our first agricultural system, ClearAg creates a platform for agriculture and expands into other modeling areas such as water use, soil properties, and crop growth.\" An example of this, says Keiser, involved a potato grower in the Northern Plains that found harvesting his crop at a certain temperature was key for maintaining crop quality and integrity. In the past, this grower sent scouts out into the field to manually assess soil temperatures before sending in the harvest equipment. \"But by using ClearAg, this grower was able to take all their soil readings remotely and he was able to accomplish his harvest a lot more efficiently than ever before,\" he says. Although some forms of variable-rate fertilizer have been used for decades, nitrogen modeling has become more pronounced recently. \"Our clientele has been using variable-rate technologies for fertilizer applications since the mid-1990s,\" says Matt Waits, CEO for SST Software. \"However, the complexity of the nitrogen cycle and how it is in a constant state of flux has always made managing nitrogen difficult.\" Recently, SST Software has partnered with Agronomic Technology Corp. (ATC) to introduce Adapt-N. According to ATC CEO Steve Sibulkin, Adapt-N was first introduced in 2014 and is becoming an important tool for properly managing nitrogen use. \"There's a belief in agriculture that today's environmental pressures will only get worse as the industry moves forward,\" says Sibulkin. \"The vast of majority of growers want simple methods to use to be able to address these concerns. That's what Adapt-N and other nitrogen modeling processes are currently bringing to the table.\" The call for compatibility across equipment manufacturers' components -- primarily through ISOBUS standards -- continues to go out. Official initial efforts to implement this began about eight years ago with the formation of the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation. The group now includes more than 170 companies, associations, and organizations that are actively collaborating to make the standards work. Industry participants that have to deal with equipment compatibility \"on the ground\" continue to be frustrated, however. Third-party tech experts often struggle to manage competing suppliers' products. Says Tim Norris, CEO of Ag Info Tech, LLC, Mount Vernon, OH: \"There will be a point hopefully where components get to be pretty much plug-and-play -- and it's a lot better than it was -- but it's still a real issue.\" << Return to The Robot Report Eric is editor of Meister Media Worldwide Agribusiness Group.

      "content": "AUTOMATICA 2016, held in June in Munich at the massive Messe tradefair facility, is a gigantic show focused on automation, mechatronics, robotics and emerging technologies as they relate to the industrial and manufacturing sectors. To give you an idea of how enormous the Messe is and the trade show was, it has two subway stops dedicated to it: one on the east side and the other on the west. They have automated walkways to get from one side to the other because it's so big and the distances are so immense. AUTOMATICA took up the east half and a European Solar trade show took up the west. AUTOMATICA used 6 exhibition halls; each about 120,000 sq ft; so the show took over 720,000 sq ft of space. There were 839 exhibitors from 47 countries which was attended by 45,000 visitors, a 30% increase from 2014 (it's a biennial show), one-third of which came from foreign countries. Inbetween each of the halls are outdoor grassy areas with food stalls, park benches and tables. It's a terrific venue. Managing Director Falk Senger described the themes of this year's show, two of which are examined below: \"AUTOMATICA showed the future of production with deep insights into the possibilities of digitalization, human-robot collaboration and professional service robotics.\"  In the not-too-distant future, billions of intelligent devices and machines - connected through network communications - will generate massive amounts of data. Turning that data into value is the key promise of digitalization.  As the price of sensors has come down, the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the consequent availability of streaming data from sensors of almost every type, the process, whatever it is called, has become an important driver of AI. Some high-value crops in agriculture such as grapes, are already beginning to be remotely monitored, vine by vine, though the use of these sensors.\n\nFANUC, the world's largest maker of industrial robots, plans to start connecting 400,000 of their installed CNC and robot systems by the end of this year. The goal is to collect data about their operations and, through the use of deep learning, improve performance and reduce downtime. Fanuc is also testing reinforcement learning as a way to train industrial robots in new tasks such as learning to grasp unfamiliar objects. A robot tries picking up objects while capturing video footage of the process. Each time it succeeds or fails, it remembers how the object looked, knowledge that is used to refine a deep learning model, or a large neural network, that controls its action. After 8+ hours it gets to 90+% accuracy which is very close to having had a human program it. Fanuc and other researchers are testing reinforcement learning as a way to simplify and speed up the programming of robots that do factory work. Google recently published details of its own research on using reinforcement learning to teach robots how to grasp objects. When many robots work in parallel, the training time required is reduced accordingly. Similarly, Kuka is building a deep-learning AI network for their industrial robots, and ABB, in it's power division, is working with Microsoft Cloud Services to enable ABB chargers to stream data for analysis as a precursor of a more extensive cloud analytics service for ABB's full range of products. The most visible deep learning efforts are in Silicon Valley which has seen widespread investment of money and talent in start-ups in AI research by almost every university, think tank, car company, telecom giants, Baidu, Alibaba and, most recently, Toyota's $1 billion investment in establishing the SV Toyota Research Institute headed by Gil Pratt (of DARPA's Robotics Challenge fame). Apple, IBM, Google and Facebook have led investment in more advanced uses, but practical deep learning systems such as Aethon's, FANUC's and Kuka's are also becoming prevalent in the industrial sector. The black box concept, i.e., the storing of streamed sensor data for analysis and learning, is already a valuable tool in air safety and may soon become a mainstay in autonomously driven transportation, mobile robots and robotics in general. That data, and super-fast computer processing, are enabling deep learning engines to find and build patterns that can make the devices safer, more productive, more cost effective - and be programmed quicker. But these very same characteristics, and those created by the new era of IoT, create security and standardization problems. There is no standard architecture for streaming data from different devices - each manufacturer has their own - and the very act of streaming opens up networks to security breaches. Consequently there is a lot that needs to happen before we'll see any widespread benefits from digitalization.  This topic is broader than just the emerging collaborative robots market spearheaded by Universal Robots and Rethink Robotics. In the US and EU the SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) movement has represented a large untapped marketplace for robotics - a marketplace to enhance worker productivity rather than replace labor.  Human-robotic collaboration also includes the movement toward the Internet of Things (IoT) described above. The telecom industry has  already set up what they call the Robolliance Program to help standardize the various methods of machine to machine, autonomous methods of connecting people, places and things, but, as of today, they haven't developed a solution. Apple just announced that iOS 10 will have a HomeKit protocol that puts control of all compatible devices in one place. But Kuka has their own protocol as does ABB, Fanuc and Yaskawa. There is no standard and each major player is offering their own as that standard. This will have to change before any true benefits can be achieved.\n\nEvery robot manufacturer at the show was showcasing their safety features enabling their robots to work safely alongside humans. But a lot was semantics and not very practical. Hence the need to differentiate the term \"human-robot collaboration\" from \"collaborative robot\" also known as \"co-bot\" or \"cobot\", the domain of the products produced by Universal Robots and Rethink Robotics. A driver of this interest in human-robot collaboration is what the auto companies have recently concluded: customized products and shorter delivery times are better served by humans than robots because these changes require more flexibility than existing robots can provide. Human productivity can be augmented by robotics and that's why this topic was one of the themes as AUTOMATICA: humans and robots working together to increase productivity and increase flexibility by each doing what they can do best. Humans can see, select and grasp; robots can handle, move, process, lift and repetively process. The car companies have already come to this conclusion and are hiring workers and replacing old-style inflexible robots with either humans or humans augmented with co-bots. Henrik Schunk, Managing Partner of Schunk, the well-known German gripper and arm maker, said: We currently see two central trends in assembly and handling technology: First, the trend towards digitalization in the course of Industry 4.0 and consequently towards the mechanization of assembly and handling systems. And second, the trend towards human-robot collaboration, which will allow new automation scenarios.  << Return to The Robot Report Frank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global(tm) Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "The highly anticipated rules governing commercial operation of small UAS (sUAS) were announced by the FAA and will take effect in late August. Until that time, commercial operators may continue to operate under Section 333 exemptions. One of the most significant changes for industry is that commercial operations that fit within the framework of Part 107 will no longer require approval by exemption, which has typically taken months to secure.  Undoubtedly, the new framework will mean increased efficiency for commercial operators who will also not be required to secure airworthiness certification for their sUAS. The fact that operators will no longer be required to hold a manned aircraft pilot's license and can instead take a knowledge test to obtain a sUAS operator's certificate is a significant win for the industry that will open up the skies to make more operators.  Brendan Schulman, VP of Policy and Legal at DJI remarks: \"This is a global precedent.  The most respected aviation authority in the world has concluded that drones may be operated safely for basic commercial operations without requiring airworthiness certification and without requiring pilots to pass a practical flight examination.  This reflects how fundamentally safe and beneficial this technology is, and is a model that should be adopted worldwide.\" The removal of the requirement to obtain a sport pilot's license comes as no surprise as the NPRM stated that the \"training, testing, proficiency and experience requirements for obtaining a commercial pilot's license have limited relevance to the nature of small UAS operations.\"  In addition to passing the aeronautical knowledge examination, pilots will be required to self-certify that they have the physical capacity required to safely operate sUAS.  They will also need to undergo a TSA security threat determination.   In anticipation of the skies opening up significantly for sUAS, last year President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum directing the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to convene an industry-led multi-stakeholder process to address privacy, transparency and accountability issues raised by UAS.  In May - after many months of meetings - various industry stakeholders reached consensus on voluntary best practices for conducting UAS operations.  Jules Polonetsky, CEO of Future of Privacy Forum, one of the stakeholders involved in the NTIA process states that with the final rule in place: \"Drones will bring a wide range of benefits, but for widespread acceptance, it will be essential for the public to feel comfortable that personal data collected by drone operators will be used responsibly.  The drone privacy best practices provide guideposts that will help major companies and small operators alike demonstrate that they handle data in a trustworthy manner.\" In the coming months, with support of the White House, industry stakeholders will work towards developing educational initiatives surrounding the privacy best practices aimed at promoting broad industry adoption. In addition to responding to privacy concerns surrounding drones, what the industry needs to achieve its full potential is a framework that supports beyond line of sight operations.  This sentiment was expressed by Kurt Carraway, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Executive Director at Kansas State University (KSU): who commented on the Pathfinder Program which is a vehicle established to research how to fly beyond line of sight safely: \"the methodologies incorporated into this great work are exactly what is needed to strike the balance between the advancement of the UAS industry and expansion of integration into the national airspace in a safe manner.\" In the meantime, industry reactions to the final rule suggest a general excitement surrounding the future of UAS.  Bob Young, CEO of PrecisionHawk remarked that \"today, the FAA revealed new regulations that maximize freedom andsafety, promoting business innovation that will take the industry to the next level. The rules recognize the value of drones as a tool to preserve our growing planet's diminishing resources without jeopardizing a stellar safety record. We are excited to about the bright future of flying robots.\" Excerpted from an article by Evan Ackerman in IEEE/Spectrum: If you're making money with your drone--by taking pictures or videos with it or whatever--and it weights less than 25 kg but more than 0.25 kg, these are the rules that apply to you. They're slightly different from the rules for recreational hobby drones, so it's worth browsing what's new: Other requirements for the aircraft and pilot: << Return to The Robot Report Robohub is a non-profit online communication platform that brings together experts in robotics research, start-ups, business, and education from across the globe.

      "content": "FANUC, the world's largest maker of industrial robots, plans to start connecting 400,000 of their installed systems by the end of this year. The goal is to collect data about their operations and, through the use of deep learning, improve performance. Similarly, Kuka is building a deep-learning AI network for their industrial robots. In 2014, FANUC partnered with Cisco on a 12-month zero downtime (ZDT) pilot project with General Motors. FANUC is now moving forward to connect all its manufacturing robots. The system proactively detects and informs of a potential equipment or process problem before unexpected downtime occurs. This lets FANUC and its customers schedule and perform maintenance during a planned outage window, so operations aren't disrupted. FANUC robots contain sensors that constantly gather data on temperature, cycles, machine operator activities, and other metrics. This data is then dynamically analyzed to predict wear on parts such as bearings or transducers. An analytics engine captures out-of-range exceptions and predicts maintenance needs. The cloud app alerts FANUC service personnel and its manufacturing customer about the need for service and replacement part(s). The part(s) is automatically shipped to arrive at the factory in time for the next scheduled planned maintenance window. This kind of proactive, planned maintenance can unleash dramatic savings and is different from present-day equipment- and part-life maintenance and service programs. General Motors estimated unplanned downtime costs thousands per minute and FANUC hopes to help GM save an estimated $40 million in downtime.  FANUC ZDT is part of the FANUC FIELD system which provides end users with an integrated manufacturing solution for interconnecting and analyzing data from CNC devices, robots and sensors. FANUC was named a 2016 Innovation Award winner for its ZDT Application. \"We partnered with Cisco to create highly secure connections from our robotic equipment in GM's factories to Cisco's Cloud Data Center where FANUC is able to perform analytics on how the robots are performing,\" said Rick Schneider, Chairman and CEO, FANUC America. \"The ability to collect data from our robots and analyze it in the cloud, to predict potential equipment issues before downtime occurs, allows us to proactively address our customer's needs. With ZDT, we can also take advantage of the data collected from our robots to optimize GM's manufacturing systems by reducing energy consumption, extending equipment life, improving cycle time and quality. Reducing downtime through ZDT has proven to have a direct and positive impact on GM's plant's performance.\" Kuka is working with Huawei, the Chinese phone maker and communications service company, on a similar project to develop a global 5G network enabling the connection of Kuka robots across many factories. The companies say they plan to integrate artificial intelligence and deep learning into the system to help manufacturing businesses remain agile and drive growth. In a March, 2016 agreement, Huawei and Kuka said they will collaborate in the areas of cloud computing, big data, mobile technology, and industrial robots. [Gartner Research says Huawei has 8.3% of the global smartphone market, compared to 23% for Samsung and 15% for Apple. Huawei's sales in the first couple of months of 2016 were up 59% from 2015 while Samsung's smartphone sales were flat and Apple's dipped 14%. Speaking at the Converge technology conference in Hong Kong, Richard Yu, the head of Huawei's consumer electronics business, said he believes passing Samsung and Apple is a goal within reach.] ABB offers an optional software package to ABB robot owners called Connected Services. This is a 24/7/365 monitoring service for their robots but administered by the client; it is not an ABB-wide effort to monitor and learn from their whole network of robots around the world. However, that learning capability is available and may be available in the future as can be seen by ABB's Connected Service offered by ABB's power business, where they are working together with Microsoft on a cloud-based e-mobility charging platform for power stations for electronic vehicle recharging. This will include user recognition, accepting payments, and data transfer of streaming data for system stability and monitoring. \"ABB and Microsoft Corp. announced [in March, 2016] the worldwide availability of a new electric vehicle (EV) fast-charging services platform. The collaboration will also take advantage of machine learning and predictive analytic capabilities to drive future innovations. Under the new collaboration, all ABB chargers will be connected to the Microsoft Azure cloud and surrounded by value-adding services, allowing operators and manufacturers and partners to take advantage of a world-class platform.\" Kuka, ABB and FANUC - as are most robot makers - are late to the A.I. and deep learning party, but still very welcomed. Aethon, a mobile robotics company focusing on the hospital industry, started their Cloud Command Center in 2006 from which they remotely monitor, support and even control the autonomous mobile robots installed at their customer's locations.  Aethon staffs the command center 24/7/365 and has over 400 TUGs in 140 locations online and in constant communication with the command center.  Occasionally a TUG finds itself in a situation where it needs help. Rather than rely on customer personnel to address this, the command center takes over and manages the situation.\n\nAlgorithms monitor the status of each TUG in real-time and if the algorithms detect a TUG might need help an alert is sent to an on-duty support staff member who, using a secure VPN connection, can connect to the TUG's on board sensors to assess the situation. In the simplest of solutions, the operator can drive the device out of the situation. Whatever the case, the command system updates with the solution and the criteria that precipitated the situation. Thus the system is not only handling problems, it is learning how to anticipate those very same situations in the future and proactively prevent them. The most visible of the efforts in deep learning are in Silicon Valley which has seen widespread start-ups in A.I. research by almost every car company, Baidu, Alibaba and, most recently, Toyota's $1 billion investment in establishing the SV Toyota Research Institute headed by Gil Pratt (of DARPA's Robotics Challenge fame). Apple, Google and Facebook have led investment in more advanced uses, but practical deep learning systems such as Aethon's, FANUC's and Kuka's are also becoming prevalent in the industrial sector. The black box concept, i.e., the storing of streamed sensor data for analysis and learning, is a valuable tool in air safety and may soon become a mainstay in autonomously driven transportation, mobile robots and robotics in general. That data, and super-fast computer processing, are enabling deep learning engines to find and build patterns that can make the devices safer, more productive, and more cost effective. << Return to The Robot Report Frank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global(tm) Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "According to AgFunder's 2016 AgTech Investing Report (supported by The Robot Report's own research), 2016 drone funding fell 64% from 2015 levels. Also, the types of UAS companies that got funded weren't drone makers.In 2015, according to AgFunder, the largest drone deal was DJI\u2019s $75 million followed by 3D Robotics\u2019 $64 million. In 2016, the largest deal was 3D Robotics\u2019 $27 million and the majority of drone tech deals closed during the year were seed stage (15 out of 25), whereas there was an even split between late and seed stage deals in 2015.The Robot Report's year-end article: 2016 best year ever for funding robotics startup companies included 27 UAS deals. The largest was for $43.8 million to a meds drone delivery service, Zipline International. The 2nd largest was $30 million to Airware, to fund their acquisition of Redbird (a French drone-powered analytics provider) and development of a set of technology systems to plan, fly, and analyze aerial data - particularly valuable for insurance adjusters and contractors. Then came 3D Robotics' $27 million which helped them wind down and reconfigure themselves from a drone maker to a drone services provider.The mix of companies receiving funding in 2016 was different than in 2015 where the big money went to drone makers: DJI ($75M) 3D Robotics ($64M), Yuneec Electric Aviation ($60M), Ehang ($44M), and CyPhy Works ($25.4M).2017 fundings continue the 2016 pattern: Drone Delivery raised $8.1M to further their depot to depot delivery system, Flytrex raised $3M to manufacture drone components, Flirty, a medicine and food delivery drone startup got $16M, Measure got $15M for their drones-as-a-service company for insurers, AirMap got $26M for a real-time air traffic management system, Dedrone got $15M for a drone tracking system, Airware raised an additional but undisclosed sum and Arbe Robotics got $2.5M for a real-time drone mapping system. No drone makers in the lot!DJI is by far the leading quadcopter maker in the world. At a recent drone trade show, most of the booths that displayed multi-rotor drones doing specialized tasks used DJI drones to demonstrate their products. As drones are becomming less of a flying camera and hobby and more to provide commercial and industrial services, DJI is still leading the pack.According to Bloomberg Businessweek, DJI is valued at $10 billion and makes 60-65% of all non-military drones. DJI designs, prototypes and manufacturers all their products in their own factories in Shenzhen and all their sub-contractors are in Shenzhen as well. Thus they control the supply chain and can produce new drones every 6 months thereby whipping the competition. Very Apple-like (after which they pattern themselves).Nevertheless, even DJI has seen the change from drone-making to providing meaningful services with drones. It\u2019s tough to maintain momentum with just hardware no matter how good it is. DJI, while continuing to develop new products and upgraded versions of their drones, has suffered the same limitations as other makers and service providers: limited battery life, regulations regarding line of sight and autonomy, connectivity issues, image processing and analysis, limited payload capacity and the commoditization of drones themselves. But, as Paul Turner, CEO of AgDNA wrote recently on Medium:\u201cOnce drones are able to take off autonomously, scan a field [or object], upload data, recharge and continue operation without human intervention\u200a\u2014\u200athis will be a game changer.\u201dWe're almost there.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "America's retailers are closing stores faster than ever while demand for warehouse workers by online retailers is higher than ever. Retailers and logistics companies have been opening facilities at a record pace and in this fast-paced world, warehousing and logistics managers are looking for robotics solutions to remain competitive.UPDATED 4/18/2017 to show Chinese entry into mobile robot race. See below.Chicago's huge McCormick Place Conference Center was once again home to the Automate and ProMat trade shows. ProMat for material handling solutions; Automate for robotics. Over 900 exhibitors covered 350,000 sq ft at ProMat while 400+ companies exhibited at the Automate show. Most of the companies listed below exhibited at one or both of these two shows.According to an article in The Wall Street Journal, the warehousing and logistics sectors are expanding dramatically as more people shop online. The two sectors accounted for 945,200 jobs in March, up 5.3% over 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Tractica, a market intelligence firm, forecasts revenue for the two sectors will grow exponentially and reach $22.4 billion by the end of 2021.Hence the many new mobility products at the ProMat show and the mood of the attendees to be buyers/adopters rather than looky-loos.Two years ago there was little discussion and promotion of bare-bones mobile robots although there were many guided AGVs, forklifts, self-driving vision kits and speciality tows as well as mobile picking solutions.This time there were lots of new vendors and much discussion about mobility and point-to-point mobile platforms to carry everything from cases to pods to shelves. Danish startup MiR (Mobile Industrial Robots) is on track to sell 600 mobile robots this year, up from 200 in 2016. Fetch, the Silicon Valley startup offering a pick and deliver solution, has altered their business plan as their clients have expressed needs that can be met with two new simple Freight robot platforms carrying loads from 500 to 1,500 kilograms plus their existing mini-carrier for loads under 80kg. Clearpath and their OTTO robots, like Fetch, carry loads up to 1,500kg. All deliver their loads safely with lights, bells and signals that interact with humans in their path. And all rely on user companies to customize what's carried, the payload, where the payload is to go, and what special fixtures are needed to hold, grab, slide, and otherwise handle the goods being carried.Clearpath, Fetch and MiR have discovered a market segment of point-to-point deliveries and pickups using a basic mobile platform and letting the end user add any needed shelves or fixtures. All three companies are reaping the benefits of this marketplace by a rising number of orders from both industrial and warehousing sources.Although there were many startups attempting to fill the void left by Kiva Systems as their goods-to-man system was taken inhouse by Amazon, many of those companies are finding resistance to their picking solutions because users prefer to use humans for that operation because they are faster and more accurate. But these same end-users want help moving picked items, consequently the interest in bare-bones mobile robotic platforms as \"gofor's.\" These mobile platforms all use various systems of navigational awareness with lights and beeps to interact with humans. Colors (white, red, orange and green) plus blinking to indicate turning and other warnings; beeping to indicate backing up, etc. [NOTE: Amazon didn't exhibit their warehouse systems and services at either show.]Below is a list of some of those mobile platform providers (and a few that didn't exhibit at either show). There were many other AGV, lift and mobile manipulator providers exhibiting at the two shows which may be profiled in a future article. The following providers offer mobile solutions but don't offer robotic platforms as separate products:This news video shows hundreds of orange robots from Chinese company Hanzhou Hikrobot Technology sorting packages at a mailing center. Although they weren't present at either of the two shows in Chicago, they are selling their mobile flipper robots all over China.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Amongst all the activity in autonomously driven vehicle joint ventures, new R&D facilities, strategic acquisitions (such as Mobileye being acquired by Intel) and booming startup fundings, two big players in the industry, NVIDIA and Bosch, are partnering to develop an AI self-driving car supercomputer.Bosch CEO Dr. Volkmar Denner announced the partnership during his keynote address at Bosch Connected World, in Berlin.\"Automated driving makes roads safer, and artificial intelligence is the key to making that happen,\" said Denner. \"We are making the car smart. We are teaching the car how to maneuver through road traffic by itself.\"The Bosch AI car computer  will use NVIDIA AI PX technology, the upcoming AI car superchip, advertised as the world's first single-chip processor designed to achieve Level-4 autonomous driving (see ADAS chart). The unprecedented level of performance is necessary to handle the massive amount of computation required for the various tasks self-driving vehicles must perform which include running deep neural nets to sense surroundings, understanding the 3D environment, localizing themselves on an HD map, predicting the behavior and position of other objects, as well as computing car dynamics and a safe path forward.Essentially, the NVIDIA platform enables vehicles to be trained on the complexities of driving, operated autonomously and updated over the air with new features and capabilities. And Bosch, which is the one of the world's largest auto parts makers, has the Tier 1 credentials to mass-produce this AI-enabled supercomputer for a good portion of the auto industry.\"Self-driving cars is a challenge that can finally be solved with recent breakthroughs in deep learning and artificial intelligence,\" said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and CEO, NVIDIA. \"Using DRIVE PX AI car computer, Bosch will build automotive-grade systems for the mass production of autonomous cars. Together we will realize a future where autonomous vehicles make mobility safe and accessible to all.\"Today's most advanced cars use about half a teraflop of computing power (a measure of the ability of the computer to calculate 1 trillion floating-point operations per second). This will rise to around 50 teraflops in cars equipped with Level 4 self-driving systems (Level 4 is fully capable of driving the car with no human intervention, but only under specific circumstances. Brake pedal and steering wheel must be present. Most of the Level 4 systems under development depend on highly detailed maps and are thus geofenced, or limited to operating in mapped areas.)The NVIDIA AI PX chip presently works at 11 teraflops speed but Nvidia plans to improve the chip and increase its speed to handle Level 4 operations. [Nvidia is also partnering with automakers Audi and Mercedes-Benz.]\"This is the kind of strategic tie-up that lets both partners do what they do best \u2013 Nvidia can focus on developing the core AI supercomputing tech, and Bosch can provide relationships and sales operations that offer true scale and reach,\" says Darrell Etherington for TechCrunch.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

Both companies declined to disclose further details.Argo AI plans to fully support Ford but eventually license its software and sensor suite to other companies. This unusual arrangement is part of the deal agreement where Argo AI will become a subsidiary of Ford, and Ford will be the majority shareholder of Argo AI, but the company will operate independently and have its own board of directors. Argo AI's status as a quasi independent company would let it attract employees with salaries comparable to hot startups, as well as offer stock options. \"Let's face it, there's a war for talent these days. Argo [being able] to offer equity participation, we think it's pretty unique.\"\u201cOur view [is that], in the future, there will be a number of players that will have systems,\u201d Ford CEO Mark Fields told Recode in an interview. \u201cThere won\u2019t be just one winner. But at the same time we can offer that to other companies where it doesn\u2019t compromise our competitive advantages.

      "content": "Business maturity is what startups often need when they ask for an 'adult' to come and manage their company. That was certainly the case with Danish startup Universal Robots as they sought funds and a new CEO in 2008.Esben \u00d8stergaard (pictured), Kasper St\u00f8y and Kristian Kassow, two young PhD's and a civil engineer, all from the University of Southern Denmark (USD) located in Odense, came together in 2005 to make flexible robots. Kassow had a vision of running a robot manufacturing business, St\u00f8y and \u00d8stergaard, were to focus on the software, engineering and other practicalities. \u00d8stergaard also had a vision: he wanted to make robot technology accessible to all by developing small, user-friendly, reasonably priced, flexible industrial robots that were safe to work with and easy to program. Kassow created a business plan and secured their initial seed/startup round of funding from Syddansk Innovation, a state-funded investor and incubator for Danish technology startups. They named their new company Universal Robots A/S (UR).The startup was located at the USD where Kassow and \u00d8stergaard worked and St\u00f8y taught. They planned to spend 2005 and 2006 developing and building prototypes which would then be used to demonstrate their proof of concept and help secure a scale-up funding round. After a while St\u00f8y opted to teach full time rather than continue to work on the project and, because construction materials were more costly than planned, and the development phase was taking longer than expected, the two remaining founders took on some paid research to sustain their efforts. Making their robot easy to program was a major focus and they developed an intuitive touch screen and graphical user interface which made it surprisingly simple for users to program. Safety was the other major concern and they enlisted the Danish Technological Institute (DTI) to test their new robot. DTI confirmed that it would function in a safe manner without needing to be caged in; thus enabling an important sales feature for the new robot. But their robot remained unfinished as they worked on accomodating all the uses it could be put to.In 2008 they installed and customized their first robot on the packaging line of a nearby nursery... and then ran out of money and into serious debt.A representative of the Danish Growth Fund observed their situation as he met with the two. Nevertheless he became convinced of the viability of the robot as a product, and urged his board to fund  the startup -- but also to help find an adult to take over and bring some concise direction to the company.Krog Iversen worked for many years with Denmark's largest company, Moeller/Maersk in Copenhagen and the U.S., secured an MBA from USD, and was a partner and Sales Director at Krog Iversen, the largest manufacturer of heating stoves in Denmark, a business he and his family sold in 2006. He was 10+ years senior in age to the two partners in UR in 2008 when, with funding from The Danish Growth Fund, Krog Iversen, and his family, he joined the company as CEO.Shortly thereafter he ran up against Kassow's business plan: to help UR customers customize their robots for their particular applications and to create a secondary profit center similar to the Apple App Store for the necessary accessories (grippers, covers, cameras, sensors, stands, etc.) and to provide comprehensive service and repair. Krog Iversen, on the other hand, believed in letting distributors do the hands-on work with the end users and having the company concentrate on the fewest number of products with the fewest, if any, options. Further, he thought it important that UR focus on making their robot arms without grippers or accessories; a formula which made for efficient manufacturing and required a network of integrator-type distributors. Under Krog Iversen's insistence, the partners reluctantly reworked their business plan to reflect those changes, to finalize their first six-axis robot, the UR5, to work on a UR10, and to develop a network of distributor integrators which would market directly to customers. This revised plan by Krog Iversen was a key transition point for UR: to decide to NOT be involved in how their robots would be configured to meet end-user needs and instead focus on the efficient manufacture of only two or three robots which shared components, design and software. This focus on manufacturing efficiencies and product testing carried forward as unit sales increased from hundreds to thousands per year to their present run-rate of approximately 1,500 robots per month!Krog Iversen cultivated the distributor-integrator scheme while encouraging Kassow to transform the company into an efficient manufacturing operation. 52 robots were sold and produced in 2009 and the distributor network was taking hold and promised a much bigger 2010. But Kassow became disgruntled with the direction of the company and the discipline that Krog Iversen brought to company operations. Kassow chose to leave at about the same time as the global financial crisis of 2008 was having its effect on UR: although there was excitement about the product, there was resistance to spending money until the economy stabilized. To carry the company through the slowdown, Krog Iversen and the Danish Growth Fund injected an additional $1.5 million of equity funding which was sufficient to weather the storm and carry them through 2010. Late in 2010, after only three rounds of funding, UR became profitable and was self-funded thereafter.Krog Iversen conceived marketing the UR robots as collaborative robots with two primary audiences: end users and distributor/integrators. He understood the need to educate the end user and sell distributors and integrators on the concept that UR co-bots weren't a technology play but rather one that reduced production costs, had a very short return on investment (ROI), augmented workers, and offered a high profit margin on the robots and accessories involved in a typical sale.Krog Iversen sought out a dynamic marketing manager and ambitious PR partners to help convey both of UR's target audiences. He hired Thomas Visti (pictured) to develop the international distributor network and Malene Grouleff and Mette McCall were contracted to spearhead publicity and PR in Europe and the U.S. respectively.Krog Iversen brought his discipline to their marketing and PR decisions as well. He encouraged the production and promotion of video use cases that emphasized ROI, efficiency and ease of operation. Safety was implied but ROI, ease of use and productivity were the key selling points. Videos were made and distributed that showed how easy it was to set up and program the robot. And he encouraged an open-door quick-response policy for all types of media while promising to always be available to the media.Said McCall of some of her experiences on behalf of UR:My agency helped spread the word of the distributors\u2019 excitement taking on this new line of UR robots and by the Spring of 2013, we were able to produce our first U.S. case study. Traveling around North America telling the stories of the many varied and surprising ways UR robots are being deployed has been the most fun, creative and rewarding assignment. This is where journalism and the \u201cgood story\u201d concept is leveraged. The robots lend themselves so well to video storytelling; when a line operator laughingly tells you that they named their new UR robots \u201cThelma\" and \"Louise\u201d because they thought they were going to drive them over a cliff and they would all lose their jobs (which they didn\u2019t, they got better jobs after the robot took over their ergonomically unfavorable tasks), or when the first automation engineers started to wheel the robots around between tasks - something unthinkable with traditional industrial robots that stay bolted down in a cage.Enrico always encouraged us to position UR through these case studies and he was always the first to grab a robot arm and give a demo. We had fun doing a press tour in New York taking a UR5 in two cardboard boxes, wheeling it on a hand truck in and out of Manhattan offices presenting the robot directly to the editors \u2013 that was the first time they ever had a live demo of an industrial robot right at their desk!UR's two PR firms weren't the only groups promoting collaborative robotics. In Europe the SMErobotics Project, funded by the EU, produced some widely viewed videos about how small and medium-sized enterprises (SME's) could benefit from the use of low-cost flexible robots so long as they were safe and easy to program. The SMErobotics Project promoted that it was time to incorporate \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cintuitive\u201d technologies into the robot programming process. The big pitch was that the robot must be plug and play AND easy to program AND safe -- the very features that UR was promoting. The concept was that if you empowered shop employees with robotic tools that improved their combined productivity, the SME would become more cost efficient and competitive and therefore not have to move offshore.In the U.S., Rodney Brooks, an eloquent MIT professor and co-founder of iRobot, was on the road promoting his new startup, Rethink Robotics and their two-armed collaborative robot Baxter. He spoke at every event, everywhere, and described an SME marketplace ripe for collaborative robotics such as his Baxter (and UR's UR robots). He made similar points as the European SME movement but described how, through the use of co-bots such as Baxter, SME workers could become more productive, happier with their jobs, and their increased productivity more cost efficient for their company.The global SME marketplace is huge \u2013 6 million companies worldwide and almost 70% of the world\u2019s manufacturing. A few low-cost plug and play robotic tools -- like the robots sold by Rethink and UR -- could easily fit into the manufacturing process of most of these companies which is why most business executives became excited at the prospect of testing them out in their shops and factories. But the Baxter robot didn't live up to those expectations at the time whereas the UR robots did. Brooks' marketing inadvertently helped UR more than it did his own company. Thus UR sales grew throughout Europe and the U.S. From the initial business plan developed by Krog Iversen in 2008, an exit strategy was included that called for raising market value ten times and growing revenue by at least 60% to 70% each year. When those criteria were reached, then it would be time to consider offers from companies that would benefit from combining URs activities with theirs. As that time became evident, Krog Iversen found that his time was being taken up reviewing and responding to too many offers. Enrico didn't want to go public nor did he want to sell to a private equity fund. Instead, he and the board set up an Exit Committee and hired a UK investment bank to spread the word, handle the offers and cull out and recommend the very best strategic offers. Teradyne was their primary recommendation.Teradyne had purchased some UR robots and had firsthand knowledge of their value within their factories. And they were willing to pay what Krog Iversen thought as a fair price. A deal was consummated in May of 2015 for $285 million in cash and an additional $65 million if certain performance targets were met through 2018 thereby bringing the overall sales price to $350 million. From Teradyne's point of view, this was a win-win transaction: Teradyne becomes a player in the collaborative robotics space and the inventors and entrepreneurs of Universal got a serious strategic partner, one that could help them with marketing, manufacturing, management and engineering. In Krog Iversen's case, the deal offered the ability to move on to his next big thing. In March, 2016, UR and Teradyne announced that J\u00fcrgen von Hollen would become the new CEO while Krog Iversen was beginning his new career as investor.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Entertainment, camera, moon-shot and military drones are all becomming more distinct as the drone industry gets commoditized. Prices are dropping even as impressive new features are added. It's a difficult time for drone makers.UPDATED 1/13/2017: SF District Attorney files false advertising suit against Lily Robotics. Details added below.UPDATED 1/17/2017: CyPhy Works LVL 1 drone was successfully crowdfunded and then one year later refunded. Details added below.The commercial drones market consists of consumer products like toys, games and camera drones for photography and action selfies, and the professional market (called the pro-sumer market) which serves the construction, surveying, mapping, utilities, telecom, ag, public safety and insurance industries where the drone is matched with speciality software to provide package solutions unique to those industry groups. Many feel that a saturation point has been reached in the consumer marketplace and that after reaching that point it then becomes a race to the bottom in terms of price and profitability, hence the shift to the pro-sumer market by almost all drone makers.Parrot SA is a French wireless products manufacturer based in Paris, France. Parrot invented and manufactured the AR.Drone and initiated a drone division which now represents 1/3 of their business. Parrot just released its Q4 2016 report which showed a 15% drop in revenue. The company had revenues of \u20ac85 million but targeted \u20ac100 million. Revenue from drones was \u20ac60 million, with \u20ac11 million coming from commercial, and \u20ac49 million from consumer drones. As a result, Parrot announced plans to reduce its drone workforce by 35%, laying off around 290 people.Parrot plans to focus on a reduced number of consumer products, redeploy product offerings, realign resources and adjust its support teams. Conversely, Parrot will continue to invest in its commercial drone business which has been doing well and is steadily growing.3D Robotics and their Solo quadcopter were media hits until their product stumbled and their ambitious inventories didn't move. Like Parrot, 3DR laid off hundreds last year, had to shut down facilities, and has since been scrambling to keep afloat by refocusing on commercial operations in the pro-sumer marketplace.Lily, a Silicon Valley startup with a stylish camera drone and presentation, announced that although it had $34 million in pre-sales, it couldn't get additional funds to meet production demands and was closing down. What remains of the company is focused on handling refunds.\"After so much hard work, we are sad to see this adventure come to an end,\" founders Balaresque and Bradlow wrote on the Lily website. \"We are very sorry and disappointed that we will not be able to deliver your flying camera, and are incredibly grateful for your support as a pre-order customer.\"In a late development which portends difficulty for other over-exuberant marketing types, the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office filed suit against Lily Robotics over claims that the drone maker engaged in false advertising and unfair business practices. Lily said it would begin shipping drones to customers who had placed orders by February 2016, but failed to live up to that promise. The office alleged that Lily lured customers with a promotional video that was actually filmed by a \u201cmuch more expensive, professional camera drone that required two people to operate.\u201d \u201cIt does not matter if a company is established or if it is a startup,\u201d District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. \u201cEveryone in the market must follow the rules. By protecting consumers, we protect confidence in our system of commerce.\u201dIn May, 2015, CyPhy Works successfully crowdfunded $882,000 for their LVL 1 drone, a 6-bladed self-leveling device which was to sell at $495 and begin deliveries in February, 2016. In April, 2016 they cancelled the project and refunded all the Kickstarter funding claiming that delays in a key processor chip wouldn't be available until mid-2017 consequently they didn't want to delay the project until then and would instead refund all Kickstarter funders and pre-orders. Alphabet (Google) has closed down the Titan Project to fly high-altitude drones that would beam wireless Internet access back down to the earth. More than 50 project members were let go - some have moved to other Google X projects. Titan Aerospace was acquired by Google in 2014 and was reformed into the Titan Project which competed with another Google X project, Project Loon, which also has problems. Loon is temporarily mired in an IP infringement suit with Space Data.Although GoPro had a big presence at CES, their Karma drone wasn't there and the sales people said that they hope it will be re-released in a few months. Karma was high-profile, long-anticipated, and late. The Karma was supposed to be the company's hope to pull up diminishing revenues. Karma had mid-flight power failures and GoPro recalled all the devices shipped and offered refunds. GoPro cut its staff by about 200 people in November. Karma's relaunch, if it happens, will need to compensate for product and price improvements offered by DJI that outperform and underprice the Karma in all but camera lenses.DJI is the elephant in the room. Their products have outperformed, outpriced and been faster to market than all their competitors. Their marketing has emphasized integration with pro-sumer software, GoPro cameras and mounts, and other accessories. They keep on inventing and they are headquartered in Shenzhen where all their suppliers reside, hence their ability to be quick to market.\u201cWhat we realized is that it\u2019s inherently much more difficult for a Silicon Valley-based, software-focused company to compete against a vertically integrated powerhouse manufacturing company in China,\u201d said Colin Guinn, 3D Robotics' former chief revenue officer.Founded in 2006 as a company that built flight controllers for remote control toy helicopters, DJI unveiled the Phantom in 2012, an off-the-shelf drone that became the standard for consumer drones.DJI seems to have a rhythm to their products: launch, then 6-10 months later lower prices, then launch a newer upgraded product at a price point halfway between the previous product and the discounted price, then repeat the process. Even DJI has recently begun to feel the heat from fellow Chinese drone makers Xiaomi and Yuneec both of which undercut DJI with similar products at lower prices. Hence DJI's stressing their collaboration with and integration of software and accessory vendors focusing on the pro-sumer marketplace.In the defense sector the Predator, Reaper, and Global Hawk drones that have done their work in two wars have become popularized by movies that exposed their expense, their vulnerabilities, and their Las Vegas-based human pilots and sensor operators controlling them remotely. Now DARPA and the DoD are introducing new robot war machines. Their latest is drone swarms, where several small flying robots work together to do jobs previously done by the larger craft. An anti-air missile can shoot down an $18 million Reaper, but firing that same anti-air missile at a swarm of drones wouldn't work.With every Predator, there\u2019s a joystick and flight controls for a human pilot who maneuvers it. That format changes entirely with a group of autonomous swarming drones.\u201cThey are a collective organism, sharing one distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to each other like swarms in nature,\u201d according to Strategic Capabilities Office Director William Roper. Unlike the Predator, where the machine responds to the pilot\u2019s joystick, this swarm receives objectives from a human controller, and then directs itself to that location. Presumably, the swarm could still fly to a preset list of objectives even if it loses contact with a human controller, giving it the freedom to operate in the face of jamming as well as anti-air weapons.[Recently an Australian startup, DroneShield Detection, has developed a set of sensors and a StarWars-looking gun that can detect and shoot a swarm out of the sky.]Drones to protect and defend are a necessary part of government's province and a steady source of research, invention, and income for the military industrial complex. In the next four years, at least in the U.S., the defense/security segment of the drone industry is expecting significant growth.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "At RoboUniverse in San Diego in December, agricultural robots and the labor shortage were quickly identified as the biggest issues facing the industry today. Water scarcity and field health were other key issues mentioned, but it\u2019s labor that keeps farmers up at night and robotics that could come to their rescue.Labor availability and lack of fully effective automation have pushed some farming businesses to give up growing certain crops.\u201cWe purposefully moved away from crops that require a lot of labor,\u201d said Stuart Woolf, president and CEO of Woolf Farming & Processing, a Central Valley family farming group. \u201cWe now focus on tomatoes, almonds and other crops that can be mechanically harvested.\u201dHowever, pushing up the price of his fruit to pay for the increased labor costs is not a long-term solution, as Woolf said:\u201cI don\u2019t want my commodity to become a luxury item that only a few can afford to eat. The labor issue will not get better, and we\u2019re at a tipping point now, so we need to combine technology and labor to enable us to stay competitive; we can\u2019t keep raising prices, it won\u2019t work in the marketplace.\u201dAnother California fruit farmer, Harold McClarty, president of HMC Farms, said:\u201cWe won\u2019t find a technology that picks fruit the way we do. I have yet to find a robot with an effective, dexterous arm. Instead we are developing certain things that we can use in the packing houses. There are lots of modifications that can be made in the packing houses; they\u2019re a much better and easier place to innovate.\u201dAt RoboUniverse, in a track entitled The Intersection of Technology and Applications in Agriculture coordinated by ag tech startup Food Origins CEO Nathan Dorn, participants were presented with robotics-related technological opportunities from computer vision to AI and from soft and hard gripping to intelligent path planning. There was also a panel where farm managers described their needs and impatience waiting for technology to effectively perform.[Food Origins is developing sensing technology and analytics that allows it to gather and parse data in new and disruptive ways tracking value from harvest to table, allowing transparency and traceability.]Dino Giacomazzi of Giacomazzi Dairy Farms said, \u201cOur workforce is either 25 years old or 65 years old. There is no in between right now and that is a problem. The 25-year-old farm hands either don\u2019t like the work or find better work and are gone after payday. I have living animals who need the engagement from good people or good machines.\u201d In June, The Green Economy quoted Kip Tom, a 7th generation Indiana farmer who heads Tom Farms, an enterprise that encompasses 20,000 acres of corn and soybean across 7 Indiana counties and is also one of Monsanto\u2019s largest seed producers, who said:\u201cFarmers that don\u2019t learn about these new ag technologies will get left behind. Whether it's information and technology, or equipment technology, there are technologies that will help our industry deliver a sustainable, affordable, and nutritious supply of food to global consumers. It\u2019s exciting, but what is most exciting is when we see collaboration between people in the field, who understand what we need, and developers in places like Silicon Valley and the investment community saying this is something new that we haven\u2019t paid much attention to.\u201dBrian Antle, of Tanimura & Antle (T&A), built a 600-unit housing facility in Spreckels, California, to house temporary agricultural workers with H2A visas. T&A has also invested in many ag tech startups. Antle said that it was no longer an option to sit on the sidelines and wait for machinery builders to deliver solutions. \u201cWe are all losing opportunities to sell quality products because the lettuce is picked late or we are too short staffed to meet our goals. If we cannot get more people, we must find machines.\u201dData generated by sensors or drones and collected by farms on the field or during field operations, offer a wealth of information about soil, seeds, livestock, crops, costs, farm equipment and the use of water and fertilizer. Low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and advanced analytics are already beginning to help farmers analyze data like weather, temperature, moisture, prices, and communication signals, and provide insights on how to optimize and increase yield, improve farm planning, make smarter decisions about the level of resources needed, and determine when and where to distribute those resources in order to prevent waste and increase yield.Efficiency and productivity will increase in the next few years as precision agricultural methods become more prevalent and farms become smarter and more connected, but this could just be the precursor to even greater use of robotic technology in farming.BusinessInsider Intelligence predicts that IoT device installations in the agriculture world will increase from 30 million units in 2015 to 75 million in 2020, for a compound annual growth rate of 20%.OnFarm, a startup that makes an IoT platform, ran studies and determined that for the average farm, yield rose by 1.75%, energy costs dropped $7 to $13 per acre, and water use for irrigation fell by 8% when IoT devices streamed their data to software that analyzed all the input sources and output meaningful farm management prescriptions.A new report by Tractica, a Colorado research firm, forecasts that shipments of agricultural robots will increase significantly in the years ahead, rising from 32,000 units in 2016 to 594,000 units annually in 2024, by which time the market is expected to reach $74.1 billion in annual revenue.Robotics companies are keenly focused on the agricultural market opportunity. The Tractica report examined 178 industry participants - a particularly large number - who are developing and launching robotic systems to address the need for more automation to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and address labor concerns in the agriculture market. Tractica\u2019s report, \u201cAgricultural Robots\u201d, developed in collaboration with The Robot Report, examines global market trends for agricultural robots and provides 10-year market sizing and forecasts for agricultural robot shipments and revenue during the period from 2015 through 2024.  The report examines the market opportunities, barriers, and technology issues for each of the key application markets.  Market forecasts are segmented by world region and application type.

      "content": "The Beijing World Robot Conference (WRC), sponsored by Beijing City, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the China Association of Science and Technology, was held October 21-25. It was big, long, ran over a weekend, and gave a run-down of the breath of China's fast-emerging robotics industry.More than 145 vendors filled the exhibition hall which was separated into international and domestic industrial robots, and service and special purpose robots. In the main forum, 45 sessions comprising individual and panel presentations took place in the main auditorium with seating for 1,000 over three of the five days of the event. Rodney Brooks described how collaborative robots are helping bring flexibility to electronics manufacturing; KUKA's Bernd Liepert described how manufacturing benefits through the use of robotics; and IBM's Grady Booch and many others discussed the future of AI in relation to robots, manufacturing, self-driving cars and cloud processing and connectedness; to name just a few of the Western speakers. The audience consisted of business executives, government personalities, academics of all types and from all across China, Korea, Japan and the EU, robot manufacturers and their sales staffs, and, particularly on the weekend, whole families - from children to their great grandparents.A variety of contests and challenges focused on young people peppered the event: an unmanned driving challenge, an underwater robot competition, a RoboCup Challenge of robots playing soccer, and a youth challenge to work with other kids to get a robot to shoot hoops. There was even Star Challenge, a reality show about robotic startups and their key people, that will soon be broadcast on Chinese satellite and network TV.Most of the WRC reviews that appeared in Chinese and international media emphasized the abundance of human-like robots such as JiaJia, a super realistic robot capable of micro facial expressions and basic conversation, from the University of Science and Technology of China. She was the media hit as can be seen in this video which shows JiaJia, an old man in traditional Chinese clothing drawing Chinese characters with a brush, and a few other mobile robots.Other media showed a man flying a bionic butterfly drone, a badminton-playing robot that took on the crowd, and SmartTuna, a swimming industrial robot that finds leaks inside underwater pipelines which swam through clear plastic pipes for all to see.Business executives from companies that were users or candidates to use robots in their businesses were exposed to a wide range of applications and uses throughout the conference and by demonstrations on the exhibition floor. The conference program was forward-looking and addressed subjects such as Russian and Israeli co-operative partnerships, healthcare and surgical developments, collaborative robots, self-driving vehicles, drones, and research challenges that must be met for the industry to progress and succeed.About 40% of the robots on display at the show were industrial, while the rest were service and specialized robots.According to the China Robot Industry Association, 68,000 industrial robots were sold in China in 2015, up 20% compared to the same period of 2014. China accounted for about a quarter of robot sales globally in 2015, making the country the biggest market for industrial robots for three consecutive years. 32,996 industrial robots were manufactured in China last year, up 21.7% year on year.China has set goals to be able to make in-country 150,000 industrial robots in 2020, 260,000 in 2025 and 400,000 by 2030 and Shenzhen-based Siasun Robot & Automation, China's largest domestic robot manufacturer, had the largest exhibition space to show their full range of robotic products.In April, the Ministry of Industry, the Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance and other ministries jointly issued a development plan for the next 5 years which included these goals and stressed the need for service robots as well as industrial ones, hence the emphasis at the show and in the conference program of the growing importance of non-industrial robots as consumer and entertainment products, social assistants and helpers and for all manner of use in business.The Chinese government is determined to stimulate robot development in China. According to statistics released by the Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, China\u2019s domestic robot industry in 2015 was just $243 million, albeit a year-over-year increase of 55%.At the conference, Vice Premier Liu Yandong urged enhanced research and development of the industry. She said related policies should be improved, human resources should be developed, and global communication should be enhanced.According to Ms. Yandong, the development of robotics technology plays an important role in supporting intelligent manufacturing, enhancing production efficiency and improving the people\u2019s well-being, which ushers in a new era of economic and social development. She also said:The Chinese Government attaches great importance to robotics technology innovation and industrial development, and expects to speed up the development of intelligent industries represented by robotics and strengthen cultivation of innovation talents, improve synergized education mechanism and incentive evaluation mechanism integrating industries, universities, research institutes and users, and help innovation talents give full scope to their expertise; advance international exchange and cooperation, jointly develop international standards for robotics, intensify application for patents and protection of intellectual property rights, and strive to establish a robotics development pattern of inclusive development, resource sharing and complementary advantage.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Intel is establishing an autonomous driving division; hacker George Hotz is open-sourcing his self-driving software in a bid to become a network company; LiDAR and distancing devices are changing. What's it all mean?Semiconductor giant Intel, in a strategic move to become THE supplier of chips to the fast-emerging self-driving industry, is reorganizing and creating a new division. Fortune magazine said:The decision is a bet not just on a future of connected devices; it\u2019s also a wager that vehicles will be the centerpiece or at least a core component in the world of IoT. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has predicted that by 2020, the Internet of Things will include 50 billion devices and each user of those gadgets will generate 1.5 gigabytes of data every day. But, he has said, the average autonomous car will create about 40 gigabytes of data each minute.That\u2019s a lot of data to process and who better to handle the load? Intel.Intel in recent months has made key acquisitions and strategic partnerships in pursuit of their autonomous driving division's plans:A partnership with German automaker BMW and Israeli Mobileye to produce self-driving cars for city streets. The companies plan to develop the technology as an open platform that can be used by other automakers or ride-sharing companies.Delphi and Mobileye announced they will use Intel's \u201csystem on chip\u201d for autonomous vehicle systems.Intel acquired three companies with related products and plans for self-driving cars:Yogitech is a semiconductor design firm that specializes in adding safety functions to chips used in self-driving cars and other autonomous devicesArynga, which was acquired by Intel's Wind River Unit, develops software that enables vehicles to received over-the-air updates\u2014a capability used frequently by automaker Tesla to enhance performance and fix security bugs in its carsItseez, a company that specializes in machine vision technology that lets computers see and understand their surroundings - a necessityfor autonomous vehicles which need to be able to perceive the world around it.In a move toward becoming a network provider, and in response to a recent NHTSA letter which caused Hotz to cancel his self-driving aftermarket kit, Hotz announced his plans to open his software code and hardware designs to the world. On November 30th all of the code and plans were posted on Github. Hotz is encouraging people to build their own self-driving kits. His software enables adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist for certain Honda and Acura models. Fortune magazine quoted Hotz as saying:NuTonomy, an MIT spin-off and autonomous vehicle systems startup that\u2019s been testing its technology in Singapore, announced it will begin testing its self-driving Renault Zoe electric vehicles in an industrial park in South Boston in the next few weeks. Although the area is a public area, NuTonomy will, because of the nature of the industrial park, still be somewhat removed from normal vehicle and pedestrian traffic.Oryx Vision, an Israeli startup which recently got $17 million in a Series A funding round, shows off its new coherent optical radar which uses a laser to illuminate the road ahead, but radar to treat reflected signals as a wave rather than a particle. In an article in IEEE Spectrum, it was revealed that:The laser in question is a long-wave infrared laser, also called a terahertz laser because of the frequency at which it operates. Because human eyes cannot focus light at this frequency, Oryx can use higher power levels than can lidar designers. Long-wave infrared light is also poorly absorbed by water and represents only a tiny fraction of the solar radiation that reaches Earth. This means the system should not be blinded by fog or direct sunlight, as lidar systems and cameras can be.One of the potential cost savings of Oryx\u2019s technology comes from the fact that its laser does not need to be steered with mechanical mirrors or a phased array in order to capture a scene. Simple optics spread the laser beam to illuminate a wide swathe in front of the vehicle. (Oryx would not say what the system\u2019s field of view will be, but if it is not 360 degrees like rooftop lidars, a car will need multiple Oryx units facing in different directions.)The clever bit\u2014and what has prevented anyone from building a terahertz lidar before now\u2014is what happens when the light bounces back to the sensor. A second set of optics direct the incoming light onto a large number of microscopic rectifying nanoantennas. These are what Oryx\u2019s co-founder, David Ben-Bassat, has spent the past six years developing.\u201cToday, radars can see to 150- or 200 meters, but they don\u2019t have enough resolution. Lidar provides great resolution but is limited in range to about 60 meters, and to as little as 30 meters in direct sunlight,\u201d says Wellingstein. He expects Oryx\u2019s coherent optical radar to accurately locate debris in the road at 60 meters, pedestrians at 100 meters, and motorcycles at 150 meters\u2014significantly better than the performance of today\u2019s sensor systems.Regarding other industry improvements and inventions, the IEEE Spectrum article also said:But don\u2019t write off lidar just yet. Following a $150 million investment by Ford and Chinese search giant Baidu this summer, Velodyne expects an \u201cexponential increase in lidar sensor deployments.\u201d The cost of the technology is still dropping, with Velodyne estimating that one of its newer small-form lidars will cost just $500 when made at scale [at present, the price on the website is $7,999 for the new PUCK shown on the right].Solid-state lidars are also on the horizon, with manufacturers including Quanergy, Innoluce, and another Israeli start-up, Innoviz, hinting at sub-$100 devices. Osram recently said that it could have a solid-state automotive lidar on the market as soon as 2018, with an eventual target price of under $50. Its credit card\u2013size lidar may be able to detect pedestrians at distances up to 70 meters.That\u2019s not quite as good as Oryx promises, but is probably fine for all but the very fastest highway driving. The window for disrupting lidar\u2019s grip on autonomous vehicles is closing fast.Fast-emerging may be a catch-all phrase but it seems appropriate to the various parts of the self-driving vehicle marketplace. There are multiple stakeholders about to be disrupted as I wrote about in April:The stakeholders are numerous and the effects can be devastating. Think secretaries, airline reservationists, and all the others disrupted during the emergence of the digital era. The transition to self-driving vehicles and car-sharing systems is likely to cause similar worldwide disruptions. Consider the insurance industry. If accident rates go down by 90%, as many are predicting, premiums will need to go down too because the reserves for payouts, which are built into the rates, will go down as well. Also there will likely be fewer insured drivers and car owners thereby lowering the pool of insured people.Consider hotels and motels and their real estate values and employees - particularly those along the major highways. Why stop at a motel when you can snooze comfortably in a long-haul high-speed driverless car? This will likely effect short-haul airlines and airline employees as well.Think about professional drivers - truckers, taxies, limos, buses, shuttles. It is expected that many will be replaced by on-demand point-to-point self-driving devices. The list of stakeholders also goes on in the auto manufacturing industry and all the Tier 1, 2, 3 and 4 component providers and wannabees. As self-driving vehicles show their needs - for example, the need for low-cost distancing vision systems - new products will be developed and new vendors could replace old ones, hence the posturing by Velodyne, LeddarTech, Quanergy, Bosch, Valeo and all the other LiDAR providers. As the technologies emerge, it becomes clear that vehicles will be the core component in a larger connected world, streaming massive amounts of data to be analyzed in ways we haven't even fathomed yet, hence Intel's new division and the new chips from Nvidea, Qualcomm and others. It's a fast-emerging marketplace on multiple fronts.Times and our definition of cars are changing day by day - and fast emerging - a true moving target!\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "For the last many years there have been very few stock IPOs (Initial Public Offerings). Promising companies have been acquired instead, eg: Kiva Systems and Universal Robots. But two robotics-related companies have recently filed: one for the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the other for the New York Stock Exchange.Myomo, a Cambridge, MA medical device robotics startup, is using the new Reg-A crowdfunding method to seek funding for their new MYO stock to be listed on the NYSE MKT Exchange. The Reg-A rules, known as \"Regulation A+,\" were adopted by the SEC as part of the JOBS Act and became effective in June 2015. Regulation A+ is designed to allow early stage growth companies to raise up to $50 million in a crowdfunded-like public offering through a process that provides streamlined and lower-cost access to the capital markets for the issuer and provides investors the opportunity to participate in an IPO for these potentially high growth companies. Myomo has designed and developed a myoelectric upper limb orthosis that supports weak or deformed arms. Their device helps users regain the ability to perform ADLs (activities of daily living) using EMG signals to drive small motors that allow users to extend/flex elbows and open/close thumb and fingers.The IPO is expected to finalize in January 2017 and the proceeds will be used to fund Myomo's sales and marketing expansion, product development, repayment of debt and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.ZMP, a Tokyo-based service robotics provider of mobility products, has partnered with DeNa, a provider of a broad range of mobile and online services including games, e-commerce and entertainment content distribution, to develop a fleet of autonomous Level 5 robot taxis (and started a company by that name, Robot Taxi) in time for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. ZMP also partnered with Sony to develop the new AeroSense UAV startup.ZMP has filed for an IPO of approximately $82 million and plans to be traded on the TYO Mothers Market exchange under the symbol 7316.  It said that funds would be used for research and development to strengthen its self-driving technology as well as fund affiliate Robot Taxi.

      "content": "Key executives leaving (or were requested to leave) Goggle's drone delivery Project Wing; GoPro recalls all of its newly launched Karma drones and doesn't offer a replacement; DJI slashes prices. What's going on?Funding for drone makers has bottomed out although new applications using drones are still getting funded, e.g., home and business security drones. Consumer purchases are weak with DJI and Parrot's line of products capturing most of the market, and DJI's aggressive lowering of prices forcing startups and other makers to focus on specialized tasks. There's turmoil in the drone industry.GoPro Inc recalled about 2,500 drones - all of their shipments thus far - for a refund - after just a couple of weeks on the market. Units had sudden power outages. GoPro didn't say when or if it would offer a replacement product. GoPro's much-delayed Karma project is also threatened by competing and lower-priced camera drones from DJI and many others (see chart below).Part of DJI's strategy exhibited over the past few years is to offer newer and better products faster than the competition and reduce prices of previous versions in conjunction with the new launches. Their price slashing has enabled them to dominate the market. DJI discounted its popular Phantom 3 drone to about $300 today from $1,000 at the beginning of the year.3D Robotics - an early drone startup that raised more than $125 million, has seen its consumer business all but crash and had massive layoffs shortly after releasing its Solo consumer drone - a competing product to DJI's Phantom 3 - at a price ($1,500) higher than the Phantom 3. Co-founder and CEO Chris Anderson said:\"It's no fun watching prices fall by 70 percent in 9 months\"  [referring to DJI's price-cutting]. In a retrenching effort, 3DR unveiled a new commercial camera-equipped drone (the Solo) with imaging software designed for construction companies. 3DR's plan is to outfit the Solo with new technology to capture 3D images that show the shape, size and volume of items at a construction site.\"It might be too little too late for 3DR,\" said industry analyst Patrick Egan. \"They aren't the only company that is going to have problems.\"From a recent Wall Street Journal article:Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, has been developing delivery drones in its research arm since 2012 with the hopes of transforming logistics. But the drone project\u2014dubbed Project Wing\u2014has had a bumpy ride, with its original head departing in 2014.Alphabet last month pushed out the project\u2019s chief, Dave Vos, and its top commercial executive, Sean Mullaney, in large part because of conflict between the group\u2019s engineers and its commercial team, according to the people familiar with the matter. It also issued notices to several other Project Wing workers, giving them 90 days to find other positions within Alphabet, one former employee said.An Alphabet spokeswoman said the company is committed to Wing and the concept of delivery drones. Astro Teller, the new temporary head of Project Wing, has spoken recently about the potential for delivery drones to not only upend logistics, but also reinvent the concept of ownership by giving people access to some goods in minutes versus having to keep such items on hand for the rare moments they are needed. \u201cWe believe that opening the skies to faster, more efficient transportation of goods is a moonshot worth pursuing.\u201dLofty goals indeed for Google and Teller. But turning the corner from research, testing and product engineering to a functioning product that conforms to FAA and other governmental regulations and is secure from pranksters, children and thieves is another matter altogether and there's a ticking clock of competitors hoping to get to market first. Many, many companies, including Amazon, DHL, Walmart and UPS are aggressively developing drones and landing/delivery systems for same-day and/or speedy delivery.While many drone-makers overestimated demand from hobbyists and other consumers, they now see big opportunities selling to businesses. There is strong interest in software and services that can make aerial imaging useful for industries including insurance, construction, agriculture and entertainment. senseFly, a Parrot company and DelAir, the new owner of Gatewing (a drone and service provider to Trimble's global agricultural division, join startups and others (see chart below) that are focusing on software to make sense of images, whether it's the angle of a pipe laid at a new construction site or damage to a roof from a hurricane or collision-avoidance. The drone itself is just a tool in the overall objective.Parrot, whose stock has plummeted from $25 to $8 so far this year, predicted that 2016 would be a \"bloody year\" for drone makers. Parrot CEO Henri Seydoux, in an interview in Forbes in November, 2015, predicted 2016 would be a year of reckoning for the consumer drone space and that 2016 would be a \u2018bloody\u2019 12 months for any company designing and selling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for hobbyists. It\u2019s just the nature of the consumer electronics business, he said, noting that increased competition will see a commoditization of the flying robots and perhaps even the collapse of some of the weaker companies.\u201cThere are now a dozen companies doing these types of drones. It will put a lot of pressure on the market.\u201dDelivery drones will happen someday soon; drones in agriculture and construction are already happening; drones for governmental and defense/security purposes will continue to happen. What we are seeing today is a consolidation process: commercial makers are separating into consumer or business providers; although the Drone Industry Insights chart shown below is already outdated, the big makers, Parrot, DJI and Ehang are hanging in there with substantial sales. Not shown on the chart are all the defense contractors that produce drones for the military; these vendors have pretty much given up on finding niche commercial markets and are, instead, focusing on improving their products and systems.Certainly 2016 is living up to Seydoux's predictions. Even the recent spinoff by Trimble of its Gatewing division is indicative of the consolidation and refocusing of efforts toward providing meaningful services using drones rather than selling drones. They'll leave that - selling drones to hobbyists and consumers - to the few companies that are able to emerge from the dropping prices of the commoditization of this type of camera drone.The broad market will continue to grow in all three segments (consumer, commercial and military) as will the variety of end-to-end business models. Quoting Drone Industry Insights:\"There are plenty of niches waiting to be discovered and occupied. Hardware will become more capable allowing new applications. Advanced drone operation regulations will allow new use cases with a high grade of automation. The drone ecosystem is strongly technology driven and market growth will additionally be catalyzed by developments outside the drone market environment (e.g. mobile phone industry, etc.).\"\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

Iversen will join OptoForce\u2019s board of directors.OnRobot, an Odense, Denmark startup that manufactures a grasping device that can easily adapt to Universal Robots and other co-bots, got around $1M in equity funding from Enrico Krog Iversen, Thomas Visti and The Danish Growth Fund.Delair-Tech, a French UAS manufacturer, has acquired Gatewing from Trimble and also signed a strategic alliance with both Trimble and Microdrones, a German UAS maker, to be Trimbles preferred providers for UAS solutions. 100+ Gatewing employees are involved in the sale, however no financial terms were disclosed.\"This transaction is part of our continuing program to tighten our corporate focus,\" said Ron Bisio, vice president of Trimble's Geospatial Division. \"Trimble will remain actively engaged in the market by leveraging its brand-agnostic software technology for a broader range of UAS platforms.\"Rockwell Automation, an industrial automation and information conglomerate, acquired Maverick Technologies, a large American integrator of industrial robots, for an undisclosed amount.FLIR Systems, a big vision systems provider, acquired Point Grey Research, a developer of machine vision cameras for use in industrial, retail, scientific, traffic, mapping, and other advanced imaging applications, for approximately $253 million in cash.Howco, a provider of construction, transportation, mining and heavy equipment spare and replacement parts to customers worldwide, was acquired by Drone Services USA for $3.5 million to add an international and West Coast distribution capability and presence. Drone Services USA plans to continue acquiring companies to enable it to become a primary developer and manufacturer of low altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and related technologies. OPS-Ingersoll, a Germany-based integrator of robots and automation systems for the mould and die industry, sold a substantial but minority interest to two Chinese partners: Leeport Holdings and Guangdong Greatoo Molds. The goal is to optimize a strategic position in Asia through the two partners\u2019 networks.Shenyang Blue Silver Group (SBS Group), China, acquired 85% of the Ecoclean Group within the D\u00fcrr Group for around $134 million in August. The Ecoclean Group has annual sales of $224 million, 850 employees and 10 sites in 8 countries, and provides cleaning and surface processing systems - some of which are robotic - for industrial part manufacturers, mainly in the auto industry. D\u00fcrr is a provider of painting, sealing and handling robots for the global auto industry. Shenyang Blue Silver has 700 employees and also has $224 million in annual sales. One of their activities is as an integrator of industrial robots for material handling.Ralf W. Dieter, CEO of D\u00fcrr AG: \u201cWe are pleased to have found in SBS Group an ideal strategic partner for Ecoclean. The SBS Group has a clear strategic focus on machinery for processing parts in engine and transmission production and will be gaining in Ecoclean a company that is well positioned in this area.\u201dNone.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Silicon Valley and other technology centers have their share of brilliant minds. Some of them have similarly outstanding egos. A few of those have very short fuses. Such is the story of George Hotz.Hotz is certainly brilliant. He was the first person to unlock the iPhone and hack the PlayStation3. Recently his 2,000-line deep learning code, plus car hacks to capture the car's digital systems, and his driving model, has learned how and written code to drive a car. He demonstrated this to a Bloomberg reporter earlier this year after which he got some funding, hired a team of engineers and has turned that software into an inexpensive product - the green thing in his hand - which he promoted (and you can watch by clicking on the link) at TechCrunch Disrupt SF in September. The green device, the Comma One, is a $999 aftermarket add-on kit with a $24 monthly subscription fee for select Honda and Acura cars. The device replaces the rear-view mirror and captures the car's radar, steering, braking system and gas pedal. It also adds a camera.Hotz said that there were 750 of these devices at work in Beta test vehicles around the area, state and country.The TechCrunch video is in two parts: Hotz's 7-minute product presentation, and an in-depth Q&A with Darrell Etherington which is also informative and worth watching.Part of Hotz's talk was a review and critique of other companies making self-driving kits and self-driving cars. \"Shippability\" was his criteria and by that token, only Tesla has shipped and delivered a self-driving car. He was particularly hostile to the Cruise Automation people saying that they had sold out their original intention to build and sell an aftermarket kit. [For another spin on Cruise, see below.] The most politically correct thing I can say about that portion of his presentation was that his remarks were youthful.Enter the NHTSA (National Highway Transportation Safety Agency) with a strongly worded query and special order about the safety of Comma One. Recently, NHTSA has become aware that your company intends to sell a product, the \"comma one,\" that you claim allows certain Honda vehicles (and potentially certain Acura vehicles) to operate in a semi-autonomous mode. In a blog post dated October 20, 2016, you described your product as an \"advanced driver assist system,\" or \"in traditional auto manufacturer terms: as \"lane keeping assist\" and \"adaptive cruise control.\" You assert that the product \"should be legal.\"This \"aftermarket upgrade,\" as you describe it, is replacement motor vehicle equipment and your company is a manufacturer of motor vehicle equipment subject to the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Safety Act), 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301, under NHTSA's oversight. It is essential that you are aware of and in full compliance with your legal responsibilities to ensure vehicle safety before introducing this product into commerce.The NHTSA Special Order (SO) said that Comma.ai must respond under oath and accompanied by an affidavit, to 15 \"requests,\" or be fined up to $21,000 per day and/or become the subject of a civil action to compel responses. The SO asked Hotz to describe, in detail, how the Comma One is installed, what features it offers, how the driver can use the product, what conditions constitute safe operations of the device, what types of operator controls, roads, areas, speeds and environmental conditions such as weather or time of day may a car equipped with the Comma One operate safely and what testing procedures have been implemented to attest to those claims. Each of the questions require a detailed description of the basis to determine safe operation conditions. \u200bFinally, by replacing the rearview mirror, how will the Comma One block or obstruct the drivers ability to have sufficient rear view.[I don't know if the NHTSA's letter and SO are particularly harsh but certainly their concern for safety is evident as it should be; and as it should be for Hotz and the Comma.ai team. Governments and their regulations are an integral part of the process of bringing a new product like the Comma One to market. Certainly it was in their domain to request testing and safety methods from Comma. But Comma's response was definitely not predictable.]A day later Hotz Tweeted the bottom three messages you see on the right (read from bottom to top). Thus Hotz cancelled Comma's first official product even though an admirer says it was the best autonomous driving experience (top Tweet).Hotz said that Comma would turn its attention to \"other products and markets.\" It's unclear what those new products will be. But it is clear that this is a major change in direction at Comma, perhaps even the beginning of its demise.There's a saying that at some point every startup needs to bring in an adult to handle the difficult, distasteful, and often diplomaticl tasks that happen in business and with strong-willed inventors.Perhaps now would be a good time for Comma.ai to hire that adult (although it might be a little late).For those of you who thought the billion dollar acquisition of Cruise was a fluke, read on. One billion dollars! That\u2019s what GM paid earlier this year. $300 million in cash; $300 million in GM stock and the remainder in incentives to retain key employees.Up until news about the acquisition, Cruise was known as the developer of an aftermarket kit to turn select cars into self-driving cars. Actually Cruise had abandoned the kits almost a year earlier to build software instead. That's what attracted GM.A new article in Fortune by Erin Griffith sheds some insight and details into Cruise, its two founders, Kyle Vogt and Daniel Kan, and its importance to GM.Since the deal closed, Cruise has more than doubled its staff. The company\u2019s office is filling up quickly. Office space in San Francisco is already scarce and pricey, and Cruise has a unique challenge: It needs to drive cars in and out of the office. Beneath Cruise\u2019s barnlike warehouse is a fleet of Chevy Bolts, each outfitted with LiDAR laser sensors. There\u2019s only one ramp in and out of the basement. The cars are starting to feel crowded too.Cruise could solve its problem by moving its operations to the suburban sprawl of Silicon Valley proper. Like all the automakers, GM has an innovation outpost in Palo Alto. But no one at Cruise has even visited it. Staying independent is too important.Read the complete Fortune article here.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "CB Insights Drone Quarterly Financing Trends to VC-Backed Companies shows a downward trend. The Robot Report's monthly funding reports shows something different: a change in the nature of drone applications getting funded.According to CB Insights, there was $55 million invested in eight VC deals for the drone industry in the third quarter, compared with almost $106 million invested in 13 deals in the second quarter. In the third quarter of 2015, $134 million was invested in 12 drone-related companies, part of a banner year for drone startups.In The Robot Report's July, August and September monthly funding reports one can see a marked change in the type of drone-related company funding from previous months: all are applications-related and none are for the construction of drones. Many of those companies funded use DJI drones for their applications.As the drone industry gets over the fun of flying and separates into two distinct domains: (1) consumer-friendly flying cameras and (2) the business of providing data from overhead for a variety of business purposes, one can see the commoditization process happening: manufacturers of drones are consolidating and service providers are proliferating. This is what is showing up in the funding reports and also the news as companies that attempted to do it all rejigger themselves to become service providers and/or value-added resellers. 3D Robotics is an example of the latter.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "It was clear that DJI was winning the drone war by the end of 2015. Today's best sellers are mostly DJI products. Other makers (Parrot, 3D Robotics, Autel, Yuneec et al) haven't been able to capture any significant portion of the camera drone market. Most saw the writing on the wall and began switching to becoming drone service providers in other marketplaces.Shenzhen-based DJI has thousands of employees and access to capital, talent and components. They are nearby to all their component suppliers. They have a domestic as well as international market. They move fast and have continued to improve and professionalize their products. They help their clients private label their drones. Their two biggest competitors, Yuneec and Parrot, have amassed less than 5% of the market - combined.DJI's latest product is the Mavic Pro, a novel compact and foldable drone that has every feature of earlier DJI drones with the addition of more advanced collision-avoiding computer vision. It is forecast that the Mavic Pro will be the hit of the 2016/2017 Holiday Season. According to Drone Flyers, a news portal focusing on the drone industry, it\u2019s likely that over 80% of the $300-$1,500 drone market will go DJI during the 2016 Christmas season.The GoPro Karma, long anticipated by GoPro fans worldwide, was introduced in September with shipments promised in time for Christmas. They've stopped accepting orders on their website and it's rumored that shipping has been pushed back to Spring 2017. Today's drone makers are fiercely competitive and all are re-jiggering their business plans to accomodate to DJI's dominance. With two new deep-pocketed competitors (GoPro and Xioami) entering the market - and all competing in the consumer camera drone marketplace - it's hard to see how a non-Chinese provider can succeed in that particular mass market. Niche markets, yes; camera drones, no.In this fast-changing market, the time lag between design, manufacturing, selling and feedback is one major reason. But another is the Shenzhen climate for electronics manufacturing... there's nowhere else like it; nowhere else that can move as quickly; has so much manufacturing talent; and no place where costs are the lowest because all the major component manufacturers are there.3D Robotics was a bit behind in coming to that conclusion. They had visions of becoming the great American hope with their Solo product but, with a combo punch of being late and buggy during a period when DJI launched two much better and cheaper products, Solo never took off and 3DR was stuck with a significant inventory of unsold product - another hazard of buying product from China.Early this year 3DR initiated a serious retrenching with a series of layoffs and office closures and is refocusing on becoming a professional drone service provider for the agriculture, surveying, construction, security, infrastructure and other verticals. Their staff has gone from 350 to less than 80. There is no information about what today's head count is. Last year, 3DR's cofounder Jordi Munoz left the company. He's now running a robotics startup in Chula Vista, CA, Mayan Robotics. Co-founder and CEO Chris Anderson said the company would continue shifting its focus towards the corporate market and attempted to raise $45 million but was only able to get $27 million earlier this year.See also: 3D Robotics undergoing layoffs and other challenges\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "SoftBank, the Japanese telecom conglomerate, led a group that included Iconiq Capital, Prelude Ventures, Tao Capital Partners, and seven others in a $130 million funding round for Zymergen to help the company grow its workforce and scale its operations in Silicon Valley.Zymergen is a startup with a focus on biology, analytics and robots. The company is attempting to produce industrial chemicals used in making products such as soap, ink and paint - a $3 trillion market according to Fortune Magazine. Zymergen creates the building blocks of these products from non-petroleum sources and creates new kinds of chemicals that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to develop. The creation of the microbes used by Zymergen are automated in what they call 'Robotics for high-throughput biology.' A recent Fortune article describes the process here.\"The company has a robot workforce to do things like stir liquid around in a petri dish while human scientists supervise thousands of robot-controlled trials in a given week. Zymergen then takes the data from these microbe experiments and uses a proprietary algorithm to sort through millions of different genetic combinations to guide the experiments and develop the best chemical.\"Zymergen attempts to precisely automate every step and can build and test thousands of strains enabling quicker and predictable breakthroughs. Their automated lab generates more data than manual lab work and they feel that this level of automation and analytics speeds up the data capture and improves operations and engineering.Our platform enables us to process and prioritize the enormous volume of data we collect to efficiently explore the near infinite design space for microbes. Prioritizing from among vast exploration possibilities [by decoding biology with machine learning] is the key to successfully engineering new strains. Our proprietary software lets us review large regions of the genome to pinpoint areas of interest which then guides additional tests with increased precision and reliability.Ginkgo Bioworks, a Boston startup attempting to do the same sort of thing, also received $100 million in funding in June. With those funds the company plans to obtain 600 million base pairs of manufactured DNA and from that develop not-pharmaceutical manufacturing processes in new areas such as commodity chemicals, industrial enzymes and human health markets.According to TechCrunch, Ginkgo currently makes products for the flavor, fragrance and food industries as well as works with DARPA to produce probiotics that will help U.S. soldiers stave off stomach bugs they might pick up overseas.Ginkgo will also be using some of the cash to finish building Bioworks2 - a rendering shown to the right. The new, 70,000 square-foot automated facility is being built to test prototypes of Ginkgo\u2019s designer DNA and create those new products.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Dag Kittlaus was the founder and CEO of Siri, Inc. which produced an app that went into the Apple App Store in February 2010. The app quickly rose to 1st place in the Lifestyle section of the app store. In March, 2010, Steve Jobs called Kittlaus and started the dialogue that ended when Apple acquired Siri at the end of April 2010.Siri cost Apple around $200 million. In addition to the acquisition of the technology the purchase was also a smart competitive move because Siri was working on adapting the app to work on Nokia and Android phones. At the time they sold the company to Apple, Siri had 24 employees. As the team moved into the Apple apparatus, and for the next 18 months, Kittlaus headed the team at Apple that applied Siri technology to the iPhone 4S which was launched in October 2011, the month in which Steve Jobs died.The Siri app was free for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch users. The algorithms that made the app work, however, were the product of years of defense-sponsored research at SRI International. SRI spun out Siri, Inc. in 2008 to commercialize their work. This included the three Siri founders: Kittlaus, Tom Gruber, CTO, and Adam Cheyer, VP Engineering. They named the company \"Siri,\" a Norwegian girls' name. Silicon Valley venture capital firms Menlo Ventures and Morgenthaler Ventures poured $24 million into the technology that Kittlaus, Gruber and Cheyer built into the Siri app.After Jobs died, Kittlaus resigned and went back to Chicago to be near his family. Liv, his mother, was a native of Norway, and met Dag's father, Karl, when he was serving with the U.S. Air Force in France. The couple settled in Palos Heights, Ill., a Chicago suburb, and had two sons. Whenever possible, Liv took them to visit her parents and sister in Norway. Doug went to Norway and completed his MBA at BI Norwegian Business School, in Oslo and stayed in Norway for seven more years. He began his career in technology at the Scandinavian telecom giant, Telenor Mobile. Returning to the United States, he worked at Motorola for five years and then went to work with SRI and the Siri project.In 2012 Kittlaus and a small group - including Cheyer and Brigham - created a new startup, Viv Labs and their AI Viv, named after Kittlaus\u2019 mother but also the Latin root meaning live. In May, 2016 Kittlaus demonstrated Viv at a TechCrunch Disrupt event in New York. The demonstration showed that Viv was a breakthrough accomplishment in providing a single conversational user interface (UI) to recognize our words, determine our intent, and then write code to effect that intent. At the demonstration Kittlaus said that search wasn't going anywhere but as Viv and other new AI assistants become more capable and become the primary resource for users, people really won't want to go back to the old way.Enter Samsung, 5G and the Internet of Things. On October 5, 2016, Samsung announced that it had acquired Viv Labs for an undisclosed amount. As part of the acquisition, the Viv founding team will work closely with Samsung\u2019s Mobile Communications business, but continue to operate independently.\u201cUnlike other existing AI-based services, Viv has a sophisticated natural language understanding, machine learning capabilities and strategic partnerships that will enrich a broader service ecosystem,\u201d said Injong Rhee, CTO of the Mobile Communications business at Samsung Electronics. \u201cViv was built with both consumers and developers in mind. This dual focus is also what attracted us to Viv as an ideal candidate to integrate with Samsung home appliances, wearables and more, as the paradigm of how we interact with technology shifts to intelligent interfaces and voice control.\u201dIn addition to their phone business, as we near 2020, when the new 5G telecom systems begin to be deployed, starting first in Korea in 2018 and Asia in 2019 and 2020, appliance makers such as Korean Samsung foresee the interaction of their devices with the Internet in all sorts of ways. Machine-to-machine technology, including robots, self-driving cars and other cognitive computing systems that are able to make decisions and solve problems without human intervention, is here now but growing in capabilities daily, and will soon be engrained in our daily lives as the capabilities of the 5G networks kick in. Human-machine-interaction such as that offered by Viv will be facilitated by 5G.[NOTE: Samsung isn't the only buyer of this type of UI technology. Last month Google acquired API.ai, a 2011 startup providing a virtual digital assistant. In December 2014, the company pivoted to focus on becoming a developer platform for natural language processing (NLP). Their platform enables developers to create their own voice apps across a range of end markets, including the mobile device, wearables, robotics, automotive, and smart home markets.]{NOTE 2: In a move similar to Samsung's acquisition of Viv to enable integrating it with Samsung home appliances, Amazon just partnered with KITT.ai, another developer of conversation-driven interfaces for developers, to make it easier for developers to use voice-controlled products using the Alexa Voice Service.]It's all about bandwidth and speed as the chart from Akamai shows. There is a steady upward demand for connection and, once connected, speed of transaction.5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology and offers a major advance in the number of simultaneous connections that mobile networks can support - up to a million connections per 1/3 mile. Apart from providing massive capacity, 5G users will see significantly improved network speeds and low latency, well beyond the capabilities of 4G. Data speeds on 5G are estimated to reach 20 times faster than current 4G networks. Estimates suggest that 5G users would be able to download a full-length, high-definition movie in just one second. In addition, 5G is expected to come with an ultra-low latency rate of less than 1 millisecond. Existing 4G networks have a latency of 10 milliseconds. Latency is defined as the amount of time it takes for a packet of data to get from one point to another. The ultra low latency also means that advanced applications, such as autonomous driving, can be supported by 5G networks with precision.Personal assistants are all about simplifying the process of performing daily tasks. They are attempting to be what you would expect of a knowledgeable executive assistant working alongside to maximize your productivity and minimize your involvement, a person who really knows you and doesn't need you to reexplain things over and over. The list of vendors is impressive: Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, Baidu, Microsoft, Apple, SoftBank, all the car companies, smaller companies like Jibo, and many large consumer product providers - including Samsung.To date, none have achieved that sweet spot where end users are fully satisfied. The holdup has been the software, the need for extensive coding, and the ability to identify \"intent\" from sounds recognized as words. The breakthrough technology that Viv is offering is a way to change the way programmers work with computers and developers offer their products. Programmers will no longer have to instruct step-by-step procedures in rigid code, but instead they'll just have to describe the process and intent and the AI will develop the code - it will write the programs needed on the fly. And developers will just need to add Viv as their conversational UI.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "September continued the big-money spree for funding robotic startups. 10 good-sized deals and three little ones. Almost $220 million (bringing the year-to-date total well over $1 billion)! Plus another $2.2 billion paid in September for six acquisitions.Carbon 3D, a Silicon Valley 3D printer startup, raised $81 million from a group of 6 investors led by BMW Group and Sequoia Capital, GE, Nikon, JSR and GV. The funds will be used for international expansion. Parts made on Carbon machines, using the company\u2019s resins and elastomers, have different mechanical properties and a smoother surface than parts produced on traditional CNC machines because they\u2019re not deposited layer by layer, cut or milled. Instead, they\u2019re sculpted by precisely applying light and oxygen to a liquid pool of material. BMW and Ford are early users of this technology. Carbon CEO and co-founder Joe DeSimone said:\u201cWe believe that 3-d printing is a misnomer. It\u2019s historically 2-d printing over and over again and the breakthrough we [had] and wrote about in the research journal Science laid out our approach where we use light and oxygen to grow parts.\u201dZymergen, a Silicon Valley integrator of lab robotics in industrial biotech, raised $42 million in a Series A funding led by Data Collective and including AME Cloud Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurveston, HVF, Innovation Endeavors, Obvious Ventures, True Ventures and Two Sigma Ventures.Mazor Robotics (in August) completed the second tranche of the equity investment by Medtronic pursuant to a previously executed agreement between the parties. Mazor issued new securities representing 3.40% percent of Mazor's issued and outstanding share capital at a price equal to an aggregate purchase price of $20 million.Saildrone, an Alameda, CA startup, raised $14M in a Series A funding round led by Social Capital with additional funds from Capricorn Investment and Lux Capital. The funding will be used to expand Saildrone's fleet of sailing drones, enhance Saildrone's data processing capacity, and scale commercial operations.Drone Racing League has raised $12 million in new VC funding co-led by Lux Capital and RSE Ventures. Other backers include MGM, Sky Prosieben, Hearst Ventures, CAA Ventures, Vayner/RSE, Courtside Ventures, Sierra Maya Ventures and individual angels.Sarcos Robotics, a Salt Lake City maker of military exoskeleton robots, has secured $10.5 million in funding from investors including Microsoft, Caterpillar Ventures, GE Ventures, Cottonwood Technology Fund and two unnamed private investment firms. Sarcos says it will use the funds to grow its team and bring its Guardian line of robotics to market. Beyond the obvious military applications, Sarcos envisions possibilities for the machines in a number of industries, ranging from oil and gas to mining to construction and manufacturing.\"There is substantial demand for robots that can carry out challenging tasks that are too dangerous or difficult for humans.  Our human-operated robots are designed to perform meaningful, highly dexterous work in real-world settings while keeping people out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Ben Wolff, Sarcos\u2019 CEO.Rapyuta Robotics, a spin-off from the ETH Zurich, recieved $10M in a Series A funding round from SBI Investments, a Japanese VC. Funding will be used to support and expand its engineering team in order to accelerate development of additional features and new products, testing, and product release schedules plus funding of sales, and marketing efforts. Rapyuta is aiming to commercialize the RoboEarth project of enabling robots to talk and learn with and from other robots over the cloud.Mavrx, a San Francisco startup using imagery and data to make prescriptions for the ag industry, raised $10M in a Series A round led by Eclipse with Bloomberg Beta and Visionnair Ventures.Titan Medical, a Canadian startup involved in the design and development of a robotic surgical system, completed a public offering which raised $7.2 million. John Hargrove, Titan\u2019s CEO, said: \u201cWe believe we have [with these new funds] sufficient funds on hand to enable us to move forward with the advancement of human factors and usability studies of the surgical system.\"Navisens, a SF software, systems and AI startup, got $2.6 million in seed funding in a round led by Resolute Ventures with participation from KEC Ventures, Amicus Capital, Arba Seed Investment Group, and angel investor Gokul Rajaram. The company is introducing its patent-pending technology, motionDNA, a location solution that employs motion sensors for both indoor and outdoor location solutions.OnFarm, a Fresno, CA ag startup, got an additional $125k in seed funding from 500 Startups, a Silicon Valley VC focusing on providing seed funding and startup coaching. OnFarm is developing a network of sensors, weather, maps, equipment and historical crop data and providing analytical and prescriptive data as a service.Appolo Shield, an Israeli startup that is moving to Silicon Valley, received $120k in seed funding from Y Combinator. The company is developing an anti-drone system to actively protect sensitive areas. Their software takes control of intruding drones and commands them to land.Raptor Maps, a Somerville, MA startup, received $200k in seed funding from Y Combinator (in August). Raptor is providing RaaS by capturing images and providing mapping data.Apple acquired India-based Tuplejump, a machine learning startup for an undisclosed amount. This is after an August acquisition of Turi, another machine learning platform for, what Geekwire suggests as upwards of $200 million.Intel acquired Irish Movidius, a maker of image-processor chips for drones and virtual reality for $400 million. Movidius\u2019 chips help drones and smartphones recognize faces and read signs without needing to stream to the cloud and wait for a response.GE pays $1.4 billion to acquire two metal-based additive manufacturing makers:Hocomo, a Swiss provider of robotic and sensor-based rehabilitation solutions, merged with Chinese DIH International to provide comprehensive rehab solutions. Financial terms were not disclosed. DIH International is a corporate holding group from Hong Kong with offices in China, Korea, the Netherlands and the US. The merged entity will become a full solution provider for the entire rehabilitation marketplace.Cabinplant A/S, a Danish integrator of food processing equipment including a sardine packing robot cell, has sold 80% of their shares to CTB, a Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffet) company that designs, manufactures and markets ag, dairy and poultry processing equipment. Cabinplant employs 300 people and has representatives in more than 30 countries worldwide. No amount was disclosed regarding the transaction, however based on 2015 sales of $43M (from their annual report), and presuming a 10X revenue (predicated on what GE paid for the two 3D printer companies), it seems likely the selling price was in the range of $200M to $400M.CTB\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer Victor A. Mancinelli said, \u201cThe acquisition helps CTB to broaden the range of poultry processing options it can offer its customers as well as expanding into new market areas for processing, such as seafood and vegetables. Cabinplant\u2019s knowledge of the food industry and its innovative approach to product development and implementation fit very well with CTB\u2019s approach to its core markets.\u201d\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

Puig has given permission to republish his review of the show.The well-known companies in the Commercial UAV market, as expected, had large booths: DJI, Parrot, Yuneec, SenseFly, Aerialtronics, Tarot, showing rotary and fixed wing solutions, but also I found some other solutions in this trade fair:I heard some people expected much more innovative solutions in this trade fair, but the reality is that the drones sector is maturing slowly, step by step. The main technical areas that require improvements are well known: flight endurance, sense & avoid (no collision), autonomous navigation in constrained areas and fail-safe reliable systems. The drone applications are available, but the former improvements are needed to give the professional drone market real exponential growth.\n\nIndeed, many global companies are working for this market, going after the Treasure Island promised by most of the sales forecast statistics. But an important question is how to survive to this difficult, expensive and long trip. Unfortunately, I found many companies making bad choices that may make them lose the race very soon:  This is a new technology, still in its infancy, in a world that is becoming more and more global and commercially hungry and aggressive. Companies need to strategically plan and carefully execute to compete in this market.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportAlejandro Alonso-Puig is CTO of Infinium Robotics, a Singapore UAS startup.Read more \u00bb",

      "content": "There are many robotics clusters around the world successfully providing for the needs of their respective communities and a few not really achieving their desired goals. Odense and the Danish clusters certainly fall into the former category. They do so because they are organized at every level to be offering and have people that are business smart, humble and cooperative in approach, and public-spirited in nature.Clusters are a big thing in the incubation, funding and nurturing of roboticists and their enterprises. There are many stakeholders: companies that use robots; governments that want to turn technology into tax-paying entities and jobs; engineers and entrepreneurs that want to learn and be inspired by successes and about the startup scene; students that want to see where the jobs are; executives who want good local talent and help in navigating local regulations; investors who want to participate in the space; and educators who want to know there will be uses for their research, training and students.On a recent trip to Denmark, a country with less than 6 million people, I saw firsthand the magnitude and power of a successful, working robotics cluster and how it can be an equalizer as well as an instigator. For example, Denmark is 7th in global robot density, i.e., the number of multipurpose industrial robots per 10,000 employees in the manufacturing sector (behind Korea, Singapore, Japan, Germany, Sweden and Taiwan) and Denmark doesn't have an auto industry contributing to those figures.The four maps on the right show the location and types of companies involved in the robotics industry in Denmark. These companies design, develop, manufacture and integrate robots and are included in the directories of The Robot Report. [Did you know The Robot Report has a large directory covering the robotics industry and that they are all plotted on a global map which is freely accessible online?]In the lower center of each map is the island of Fyn and in the upper center of Fyn is Odense, the city and area I visited. Clusters are organized to bring together and share expertise, funding, leadership, and coaching to help make businesses successful, productive, profitable and employ people from the community. Clusters help stimulate innovation and startups, and keep workers and stakeholders informed and happy in, and pleased with, their industry. They offer expertise in international trading and collaboration. [For the purposes of this article, when I refer to a cluster I'm talking about those focused on fostering the development of robotics.]Clusters don't just happen by accident. They need knowledge sharing, community spirit and participation by all of the stakeholders. They need nearby universities to crank out students (particularly grad students) while researching breakthrough technologies. [Some examples of top-notch technical universities and the areas they cover include the Boston-Cambridge area (MIT, Boston University and Harvard), Pittsburgh (Carnegie Mellon University), Zurich (ETH Zurich and University of Zurich), Silicon Valley and SF Bay Area (Stanford and UC Berkeley), and Tokyo (University of Tokyo and Tokyo Institute of Technology).]Clusters need successes so that there's money to invest, mentors to provide coaching, and stories to be told.They need a strong technical educational system not only to provide new talent, but to research and develop new solutions to local problems. Finally, clusters need organization and help navigating technology transfer issues, local regulations, securing governmental incentives, startup help and scale-up assistance. Universities and government-sponsored funding agencies often offer these services as do accelerators and venture capital firms - but with varying levels of capability. Successful cluster organizations help cut through all the bureaucracies and expedite what needs to be done.Clusters can be planned. In China the national government has outlined and funded a massive plan to make robotics a domestic industry instead of buying robots from offshore companies. They have mandated 20 regional universities and local governments to work together to develop the technologies, incubate and fund startups, provide them with office and factory space, funding incentives, and get them up and producing. Another example is in the U.S.: the University of California San Diego (UCSD) is investing in making itself a hub for cognitive, embedded technologies and communication sciences involved in robotics by adding teaching/research staff (as UCSD is doing), by working together with venture capitalists, local tech businesses (particularly Qualcomm, whose microchips are widely used in smartphones and other wireless devices), local military research labs, startup companies, and the research labs and programs already existent at UCSD and in the area. [San Diego has major industry and defense employers with many robotics technologies and applications. There are also significant manufacturing sectors in San Diego and nearby Tijuana. And UCSD is a major plus as well. It already has a Flow Control & Coordinated Robotics Lab, a Computer Vision and Robotics Research Lab, an Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Control Lab, the Artificial Intelligence Group, and the Contextual Robotics Institute, to name just a few... plus it is located in beautiful La Jolla north of San Diego. UCSD is also nearby the Scripps and Salk Institutes.] Not all planned clusters achieve their goal. Each of the stakeholders has to play their part and serendipity also has a role in making a successful robotics cluster. Numerous cities and areas have tried and failed. Many are hopeful of success (and we are hopeful for them as well). Many are successful and productive such as RoboValley in The Netherlands, the Boston/Cambridge cluster, the cluster in Pittsburgh and the SF Bay Area/Silicon Valley cluster. It really needs active community spirit and some level of altruism. An example is the Silicon Valley cluster which struggles to get beyond an elitist flavor (which I perceive as selfishness). They have everything going for them - frequent get-togethers, lots of success stories, plentiful sources of money, multiple accelerators, really talented people including the scattering of the Willow Garage people, but they can't shake the elitest label. Billionaire Scott Hassan founded Willow Garage with a public-spirited goal to develop a general-purpose personal robot to move around a house and help the daily life of people. Willow Garage was founded in 2006 (and closed in 2014) and operated something like Bell Labs and Xerox Parc did in, and for, the PC industry: it developed the open source robotics software system (ROS) and the TurtleBot and PR2. Willow Garage funded 60 research scientists each year in an ever-changing cadre that have since migrated to prominent robotics startups and businesses around the Bay Area (and world), all stimulated by an altruistic billionaire.\"The Odense cluster began 25 years ago when Maersk was planning to build an advanced shipyard in Odense and robotic welding and the advanced software for operating self-programming robots were to play big roles. They sought help and made sizeable donations to South Denmark University (SDU). Many of the key people in today's robot scene were educated during that period, (e.g., Claus Risager was a project engineer at the shipyard and now heads the Danish Technological Institute (DTI) with a robotics division in Odense. Enrico Iversen, Thomas Visti and Esben \u00d8stergaard, CEO, COO and CTO of Universal Robots (UR), all graduated from SDU).  As the shipyard closed the robotics people moved around. The SDU assisted in the creation of UR. The MIR people [a recent mobile robotics startup in Odense with Thomas Visti as CEO] were involved in the early stage of UR. It is all a very well connected community. At the same time the Danish culture is very much a sharing one and much less competitive than the US system. As the shipyard closed down the Mayor and local politicians have been very supportive of the creation of new companies to support the local economy. Many people from that time have been key to the success. It is an ideal combination of technology, business development and entrepreneurs,\" said Henrik Christensen, a Dane that was a founder of EURON and later headed the US group that produced the American Roadmap for US Robotics. Christensen is now the director of the Contextual Robotics Institute at UC San Diego.Clusters often ride on the coattails of successful companies. This is certainly the case with the Odense cluster. Universal Robots (UR) has become a country-wide hero in Denmark and particularly in Odense, where it is headquartered and where it employs 300+ people. Universal Robots recently sold to an American supplier of test equipment, Teradyne, for $315.4 million (according to Teradyne's Edgar filing) making many of UR's top people multi-millionaires. And those very same people are already reinvesting some of their money in new ventures in Odense.The Odense cluster is multi-layered. They cooperate with national government-sponsored organizations such as RoboCluster; they work hand-in-hand with the main local university (U of Southern Denmark) and hundreds of other robot companies, research organizations and national clusters and networks. The chart below - which you can enlarge by clicking on it - provides details of the 30+ higher education programs, 10+ knowledge and research institutes, 80+ robot and automation companies and 10+ clusters and networks, plus the 2,200+ robotics-related jobs in the Odense area.On my visit I asked each person I met whether they had personally received any support from the Danish or Odense cluster and each offered a story or two that showed they had a favorable impression of those interactions, particularly with the Odense apparatus. One person said he was able, through the mayor's office, to expedite a zoning approval; another was able to work with the university (University of Southern Denmark) regarding research and finding talent; another said he got help finding local vendors capable of sub-contracting their needs; and many told me about encouraging foreign visits and assisting with foreign visitors. Others taught classes at SDU and hosted open houses at their robotics-related companies. They all told me about timely investments made by the Danish Growth Fund and other state-sponsored funding entities. I'd say that since everybody I talked with could cite an example of how they were helped by and spoke favorably toward the cluster, that the cluster was operating successfully.Another mark of a good cluster is the ability to provide local, regional and international media with timely newsworthy facts and figures; not just generic publicity but real and timely information. Universal Robots is a classic example: from their beginning they have had a bevy of PR firms working for them and operating from a policy of always providing real information, no matter the situation or circumstance. Generosity is a mental health principle: it is therapeutic. Lack of generosity takes many forms: tightness, negativity and elitism. There are many robotics clusters around the world successfully providing for the needs of their respective communities and a few not really achieving their desired goals. Odense and the Danish clusters certainly fall into the former category of successfully meeting the needs of their communities. In my opinion, they do so because they are organized at every level to be offering and have people in place that are business smart, humble and cooperative in approach, and public-spirited and generous in nature.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Two self-driving car events of note: Uber just began operating a fleet of Volvo self driving cars in Pittsburgh, and nuTonomy launched the first autonomous pilot taxi program last month in Singapore. (Both still require a driver although he/she will be as hands-off as possible.)Both Uber and nuTonomy are offering \"fully autonomous\" or full self-driving automation technology for hire. In 2013, the US Department of Transportation issued a 'guidance' that defined five levels of automation. A 'Level 4' autonomous vehicle \"is designed to perform all safety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip. Such a design anticipates that the driver will provide destination or navigation input, but is not expected to be available for control at any time during the trip. This includes both occupied and unoccupied vehicles.\" Most cars with functional autonomy right now are at Level 3, with limited self-driving automation: the driver is expected to be available for control when necessary. It's a big step from Level 3 to Level 4, but the benefits are significant: in addition to leaving the driving completely to the car, it also means that the car is capable of driving itself with no human inside, which is what makes a robotic taxi service possible and why there is so much interest in the success of these services.NuTonomy said its new \u201crobo-taxi\u201d service, which includes specially configured Renault Zoe and Mitsubishi i-MiEV electric vehicles, will run within Singapore\u2019s One-North business district, where the company has been conducting daily autonomous vehicle testing since April. The vehicles are fully autonomous but an engineer from the company will ride in the vehicle both to monitor its performance and to take over control if required at some point for safety or other reasons.The pilot program uses smartphone app-based Uber-like call, instruct and pay software.The program is the result of an agreement between NuTonomy, a Cambridge, MA-based startup of two former MIT robotics and intelligent vehicle technology engineers, and Singapore\u2019s Land Transport Authority (LTA), for trials of an autonomous mobility-on-demand transportation service.The launch of Uber's self-driving pilot program unveils Uber's secretive autonomous vehicles program and marks the first time self-driving cars have been so freely available to the public.Quoting from a Reuters story:\"Uber provided ride-alongs to reporters on Tuesday. During a ride of about one hour, Reuters observed the Uber car safely - and for the most part smoothly - stop at red lights and accelerate at green lights, travel over a bridge, move around a mail truck and slow for a driver opening a car door on a busy street. All without a person touching the controls.\"Uber's Pittsburgh fleet consists of Volvo SUVs and Ford Fusion cars outfitted with 3D cameras, global positioning systems (GPS) and a LiDAR that uses lasers to assess the shape and distance of objects, all mounted with seeming lack of design to the vehicle's roof. Pittsburgh is full of steep hills and narrow streets, potholes, tunnels and more than 440 bridges. It has snow and ice in the winter, blossoming trees that can hide street signs and traffic signals in the spring, blinding sun in the summer and a slippery ground cover of fallen leaves in the autumn. But Pittsburgh also offers Uber city leadership who have rolled out the red carpet plus helped pass a state law that allows for autonomous cars (as long as someone is behind the wheel to take over if needed).Thus the merits of Uber's new program: if Uber can do it in Pittsburgh, they can do it anywhere.The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) and the Geneva-based International Organization for Standardization (ISO) have had an established definition for industrial robots for many years. Service robots, the everything else category, represents all other non-industrial robots. That's a tough category to define because it's a moving target as the industry grows and technologies improve. Now with questions rising about whether Level 3, 4 and 5 cars are robotic, or whether many consumer drones are just remote-controlled, the IFR has decided to hold workshops in October and November and release their findings and suggestions for redefining what is a robot by the end of the year.Here is the present IFR service robot definition:[A robot system is a system comprising robot(s), end-effector(s) and any machinery, equipment, devices, or sensors supporting the robot performing its task.]An industrial robot, as defined by ISO 8373:\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

Combined with clever picking, storing and stocking methods and devices involving both humans and robots, this industry segment is able to handle more picks at a faster rate more reliably than before, hopefully keeping up with consumer demand. Many startups are focused on this area of warehouse robotic innovation complicated when Amazon decided to take Kiva Systems inhouse and not resell their systems.

      "content": "Spin-offs are disrupting but often necessary. Here are two recent examples: iRobot sold off its Defense & Security Business Unit to a private equity firm, and Harvest Automation sold the IP and work in process of its warehousing robot group to a new venture-backed startup.iRobot's Defense & Security Business Unit, according to their annual report, averaged $50 million in sales for three years in a row (2013, 2014 and 2015) while home robots rose from $428 million to $560 million during the same period. The defense unit had difficulty as the wars ended in Iraq and Afghanistan and the DoD and DARPA reduced spending. Simultaneously iRobot was being hounded by activist shareholders to rid itself of the unit so that it could focus on the consumer market. This led to a heated proxy fight about adding activist board members. iRobot won that fight but also announced that it had changed its strategy and decided not to pursue DoD funded research.iRobot appears to be going about ridding itself of non-consumer products and services. In February 2016, iRobot reached a deal with Arlington Capital Partners, a DC-based private equity firm focused on DoD and government vendors, to sell the unit to Arlington for $45 million. The deal was concluded in April when Arlington established a new company, Endeavor Robotics, manned by the 100-person iRobot staff and Defense Unit executives, and housed in the same but separate facilities adjacent to iRobot.Less publicized but similarly focused on getting the company 100% into the consumer market was the announcement by iRobot that they were planning to \"end our remaining Remote Presence marketing and business development initiatives. As we reported on our Q4 2015 call, we had already reallocated R&D resources, from a next generation Remote Presence platform, to consumer opportunities. Going forward, 100% of the company\u2019s resources will be exclusively focused on the consumer.\" Their Remote Presence Unit consisted of the AVA line of mobile robots and their joint ventures with InTouch Health and Cisco. When I asked what this meant, iRobot responded:During the second quarter, iRobot made the decision to end its remaining Remote Presence marketing and business development initiatives \u2013 ending the productizing of Ava 500. While iRobot believes that there is a future in remote presence, the Ava 500 market didn't develop fast enough to justify sustaining the ongoing investment. As iRobot previously reported on its Q4 2015 investor call in February, the company had already reallocated Remote Presence R&D resources, from a next generation Remote Presence platform, to consumer opportunities.As iRobot\u2019s greatest opportunities currently lie in developing robotic solutions for the home, the company must put its focus toward this effort to reach its full potential. Going forward, 100% of the company\u2019s resources will be exclusively focused on the consumer market.Through its venture unit, iRobot has invested in 6 River Systems, a startup attempting to provide a warehousing solution to the problems caused by Kiva Systems and their novel goods-to-man mobile robot system taken in-house by Amazon and becoming unavailable to all others. That iRobot investment, plus their forthcoming robotic lawnmower, and their new arrangement with Amazon Cloud Services, which may enable connected home access for iRobot products, all offer new commercial opportunities for growth. Also, their new Shanghai facility and Asian e-commerce operation are coming online and they have high hopes for both of those activities.\u201cOur team is developing innovative new technology that will propel our growth, as well as actively reviewing acquisition opportunities that will continue to position Endeavor Robotics as an industry leader. The U.S. Department of Defense is planning at least three major ground robot program acquisitions in the next few years. Based on our combat-proven platforms and leading technology, Endeavor Robotics is well-positioned for all three. We anticipate substantial growth over the next several years, both domestically and with our international customers,\" said Tom Frost, President of Endeavor Robotics.\u201cAs an independent company dedicated to tactical robotics, Endeavor Robotics will have new flexibility to meet the needs and protect the lives of our customers serving on the frontline and in dangerous environments. We\u2019ve always done our best work when we worked closely with our customers. Our new structure enables us to double down on that strategy. We believe that the future is in open architecture and collaborative solutions and we look forward to making that a reality.\u201dShortly after the transfer and their opening vision statements, Endeavor announced two strategic partnerships with RE2 Robotics and Persistent Systems. Both arrangements appear to be geared toward winning the DoD's three upcoming ground robot proposals.Although Endeavor hasn't announced any new contracts thus far, there was a year's worth of existing DoD contracts transferred with the sale/spin-off plus they have Arlington Capital to help with funding.Throughout 2015, for a year and a half, Harvest Automation split their energies between their business in agricultural field robots that transported and positioned potted plants, and a new, flexible material handling robot, in a new and separate work division. The new robot would work in factories, warehouses and distribution centers. The results of this new division's efforts were uncertain, optimistic, and costly. During those 18 months the ag business went dormant and key people left. Joe Jones, one of the founders and CTO, left to lead a startup developing a robotic weeding device for home gardens. Others joined Harvest to help transition the single-purpose field robot with a limited skill set into a multi-purpose, self-navigating, material handling robot in an even bigger warehousing pick-and-transport system. MaryEllen Sparrow came with a background in warehousing and distribution center software to head up the software development team. Funding got hard because the transition was taking longer and costing more than expected and their first product demonstrations left much to be desired. Although the agricultural side of the business, headed by Charlie Grinnell, was self-sufficient, it didn't generate enough money to fund the warehousing robot project, and the company, in order to stay afloat and preserve the ag business, decided to sell off the assets, intellectual property and prototypes for the material handling operation for an undisclosed amount to a few angel investors including Sparrow.Harvest Automation, and its now-strictly ag business, is attempting to recover from being inactive for so long, and is also developing new ag services such as helping pickers by moving their harvested items to the packing station and bringing them containers. Harvest Automation is hoping to expand its target audience from nurseries to vegetable and fruit growers.NextShift Robotics is the entity created by the angel investors that acquired the IP and prototypes. MaryEllen Sparrow became the CEO. She and a very small team are working to get their new robots to be able to take a tote and transport it from point to point as directed by an elaborate warehouse management and ordering system. This involves improving their method of navigation, their approach to getting goods onto the robot's carrying platform, and the warehouse management and ordering system control and integration software.NextShift expects to trial their new creation later this year at a couple of pilot warehouse locations.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Robotic surgery has long been dominated by Intuitive Surgical which has placed more than 3,600 of its da Vinci machines in hospitals around the world. Nevertheless, an increasing number of new players are entering the marketplace.The number of surgical procedures that use Intuitive Surgical's machines, ~700,000 in 2015, has steadily risen and was 15% year-over-year 2014 to 2015. According to Fortune, within five years 1/3 of U.S. surgeries (from 15% today) will be performed with robotic systems, with surgeons sitting at computer consoles guiding mechanical arms.Most top hospitals have invested in these robots which cost an average of $1.5 million and entail ongoing maintenance and procedures' expenses. The metrics, however, are such that insurers pay no more for surgeries that utilize the systems than for other types of minimally-invasive procedures, such as laparoscopy. Because of patents and aggressive protection of their IP, Intuitive Surgical is the only game in town. But technology is improving, methods are changing, and a fleet of new competitors - some with very deep pockets - are entering the marketplace.One market analyst said that \"robotics has only penetrated 5-10% of surgical procedures so there is a big opportunity for increased expansion for several players in the market.\" In the chart on the right prepared by Verb Surgical, one can see the growing blue of robotic-assisted procedures and the barely touched laparoscopy procedures on the horizon.\"The surgical robot device market was estimated to be $3.2 billion in 2014 and forecast to reach $20 billion by 2021 as next generation devices, systems and instruments are introduced to manage surgery through small ports in the body instead of large open wounds. The market is characterized by enormous variety and innovation. Products range from snake robots to navigation systems to highly articulated devices such as the da Vinci system. This growth industry will involve many shifts in ownership and funding,\" suggests WinterGreen Research in their 553 page, $4,000 report published in April.Fortune compiled a wish list from surgeons for improvements they would like to see in new robotic systems:Verb Surgical, with deep pockets from partners Google/Alphabet and Johnson & Johnson, and next-gen robotics technology licensed from SRI, Verb is building a surgical platform that will leverage robots, advanced imaging, machine learning, big data, and advanced instrumentation so physicians can use it in both open and minimally invasive procedures. In other words, their goal is to \u201cdemocratize surgery\u201d and give physicians more choice. Verb also envisions a system that is \"always there, always on,\" enabling the surgeon to use the robot for parts of a procedure as needed. Both Google and J&J are expected to focus on big data. \u201cBeing able to record and analyze your procedure from a big data point of view can really help make robotic surgeries more repeatable,\u201d said one financial analyst.Medtronic, another deep pockets provider, is partnering with Mazor Robotics to buy and promote Mazor's surgical spine systems. Medtronic also bought the gynecology business unit of Smith & Nephew, a competing medical device company, and Covidien, a Boston surgical robotics company that was developing a competing surgical robot system to the da Vinci, to help jump-start Medtronic's entry into this segment of the business. Medtronic has said it expects to launch its surgical robot before mid-2018 and will start in India.TransEnterix, a Canadian publicly-traded company, recently had a setback with their SurgiBot System which was turned down by the FDA. They'll have to go through a long and arduous trial process which may take a few years to get approved. As a backup plan, TransEnterix acquired the surgical robotics division of SOFAR Spa, an Italian healthcare and pharma company which has spearheaded the TELELAP ALF-X project (Advanced Laparoscopy through Force Reflection) for many years. TransEnterix just made their first sale of the ALF-X system to a hospital in Milan, Italy. The ALF-X is a slightly cheaper robotic system with lower costs-per-procedure than the da Vinci Xi system. The four-armed Alf-X, which has many features that da Vinci lacks such as eye-tracking software and haptic feedback which enables surgeons to regain a sense of touch and pressure feedback that they currently have to forgo. TransEnterix has been granted a CE Mark for the ALF-X but doesn't yet have FDA approval.Titan Medical, a Toronto-based publicly-traded company, is developing the Sport Surgical System, a system with a surgeon workstation, a mobile cart for single-incision camera and tube insertion, and a line of multi-articulated instruments, which will debut in the United States mid 2017. The Titan robotic surgical system is being designed to expand robotic surgery into areas of surgical specialties and simple and complex procedures that are currently underserviced, and to allow surgeons to perform procedures within small to medium size surgical spaces such as general surgery and cholecystectomy.Medrobotics\u2019 Flex Robotic System provides robot-assisted visualization and surgical site access to the larynx in adults and allows the use of a whole range of compatible flexible instruments through accessory channels it creates. Their system enables \u0003minimally invasive procedures in locations that were \u0003previously difficult-to-reach.Smith & Nephew, the same company that sold their gynocological division to Medtronic, recently acquired Blue Belt Technologies, which developed and offers a hand-held surgical system they call Navio for partial knee replacement using advanced robotics-assisted instruments. Navio integrates hand-held instruments with a CT-free navigation, registration and patient-specific planning process so that the surgeon has a virtual plan which removes the need for standard mechanical cutting guides and jigs.OMNI, previously named Orthopaedic Synergy and OMNILife Sciences, offers their OMNIBotics robotic-assisted hip and knee replacement system that combines navigation robotic systems and practices, implants, specialized tools, and patented technology, with advanced robotics, to help surgeons place and fit implants with greater accuracy compared to conventional approaches. Auris Surgical Robotics recently announced that Fred Moll, the entrepreneur behind Intuitive Surgical, Hansen Medical and Origin Medsystems, received $149.5 million in equity funding for his stealthy startup. Auris, founded in 2011, described itself as a venture-funded company developing a robotic microsurgical system designed specifically for opthalmic surgery. The company says they are deep in stealth mode with no comment about the funding or how it will be used. However, they purchased Hansen Medical in a deal which transfers intravascular robotic technology and IP to Auris.Stryker, in 2013, for $1.65 billion, acquired Mako Surgical. Stryker CEO Kevin Lobo said he will delay Mako's total knee surgical system introduction till 2017 even though it has already received FDA approval. \"The aim is to develop the clinical evidence and experience necessary to maximize chances for a successful commercial launch.\"Medtech designs, develops and markets a new generation of robotic assistance for the express purpose of improved surgical techniques. Medtech has two robotic products: ROSA and ROSA Brain. ROSA is an integrated multi-application console that acts as a reliable and accurate surgical assistant and a 6 DOF arm whose architecture replicates the movements of a human arm. To date, ROSA is the only robotic assistant approved for neurosurgical procedures in clinical use in Europe, the United States and Canada.Cambridge Medical Robotics (CMR) is a UK startup developing a universal robotic system for minimal access surgeries. CMR received $20 million in a Series A funding round in July and is developing a next-generation robotic system to meet all of the perceived needs of robotically-assisted surgical procedures as well as to expand the market and make the benefits of minimal access surgery universally accessible and affordable.There are other companies in the process of researching and developing robotic surgical devices, particularly in Korea, Japan and China. These include some well-funded and well-established medical device companies getting governmental support to help them be competitive with Western medical robotic companies. Those companies will be profiled in a future article.Intuitive is quite profitable. In their most recent quarterly earnings report (Q2 2016) they showed 16% growth year-over-year and net income of $185 million for the quarter, compared with $135 million for the same quarter of 2015.Intuitive also has problems: according to its 2015 Annual Report, the company is a defendant in 92 individual product liability lawsuits about patients who were either injured or died. The company is also a defendant in a Missouri lawsuit that represents 55 plaintiffs. To settle other lawsuits Intuitive recorded pretax charges of $13.8 million and $82.4 million in 2014 and 2015, respectively.Aside from battling legal claims, the company has also faced criticism from those who question the value of robotic surgery. The Wall Street Journal reported that researchers at Columbia University found robotic surgery led to higher costs and more complications when compared with laparoscopic surgery for removing ovaries and ovarian cysts. Conversely, the study barely mentioned that the results were reversed for prostate surgeries.Brian Miller, senior vice president of product development for Intuitive said that Intuitive was ready for the competition:\u201cWe look at competition really as just confirming that the robot-assisted surgery market will continue to grow. It\u2019s something that we believe, and clearly shows that people who are entering are recognizing and realizing they can\u2019t stay on the sidelines any longer.\u201d\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Despite all the high-profile billion-dollar acquisitions, eg: ARM by SoftBank, KUKA by Midea and Uber China by Didi Chuxing, M&A are down 19% this year according to both Forbes and CB Insights. Buyers are buying, but they are seeking cash-positive market-realistic targets. Values (both monetary and vanity) are taking a hit. What\u2019s a startup to do? According to CB Insights, startups can (1) get bought at a lower valuation and take the hit; (2) lower their cash burn rate and play the long game;  or, (3), if they already have strong fundamentals and good growth, continue on.Nevertheless, July's fundings and acquisitions were substantial, and this month we've added a new ancillary category (Related fundings) to give an indication of the level of funding in AI and deep learning startups.According to TechSci Research, the artificial intelligence (AI) industry is projected to grow at a CAGR of around 75% during 2016-2021. Continuous research and development in healthcare, autonomous vehicles, security and access control, robotics-as-a-service, agriculture, cyber security, and other verticals are expected to fuel the growth as are smart wearables, and the head-up display screen market. Frost & Sullivan\u2019s report about deep learning enabling the unraveling of layers of patterns in data is also propelling the AI boom. This is where it becomes really interesting both users and makers of robotics. Frank Chen, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture capital and private equity firm, said of deep learning: It is absolutely non-controversial that deep learning is the most fundamental advance in A.I. research since the start [of A.I.] in 1956. We [Andreessen Horowitz] think A.I. and deep learning can be a fundamental and technology platform shift as mobile and cloud have been in the last 5-10 years... All the serious applications from here on out need to have deep learning and AI inside in exactly the same way that all serious computing systems needed to have Intel chips inside of them. I think now about the startups that we see, that deep learning needs to be inside these new systems as a fundamental technique that we expect to see in all serious applications moving forward.Read and view more about deep learning.

      "content": "Flying robots perform 100th show on Broadway, using new localization technology and algorithms designed and created by Verity Studios of Zurich in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil for their new show PARAMOUR.Since April, a troupe of eight flying machines has been performing in a Cirque du Soleil Broadway show called PARAMOUR. This group of quadcopters has completed its first 100 shows in front of a live theater audience, without a single incident. Given the string of recent safety incidents with drones (there\u2019s more), this begs the question: How was this accomplished?The Paramour quadcopters were designed and created by Verity Studios of Zurich and were transformed into flying lampshades in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil. Some readers may recognize them as the direct siblings of the similarly dressed quadcopters in Sparked: A Live Interaction Between Humans and Quadcopters; a short movie shot over the span of two days in the controlled environment of a research lab (see previous Robohub article and Quadrotors vs. CGI Q&A.) What sets the Paramour quadcopters apart, and the key to their ongoing success on Broadway, are a new localization technology and fail-safe algorithms, that keep the fully redundant quadcopters safely on course, performing 8 times a week, in front of a live audience of up to 2,000 people, without nets.The people behind Verity Studios are no strangers to performing quadcopters. Founder Raffaello D\u2019Andrea is a professor of control systems at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), from which Verity Studios was spun off. From a lab aptly named the Flying Machine Arena he has been conducting research for over 10 years on complex, autonomous flight, using a high-precision motion capture system to guide the vehicles. The ETH team\u2019s first dancing drones performed in 2009 as part of research by Prof. D\u2019Andrea\u2019s former PhD students, Federico Augugliaro and Angela Schoellig. The group first stepped into the public performance space in 2011 with Flight Assembled Architecture, the world\u2019s first multi-quadcopter performance in front of a large audience. In all, more than 200 live research demonstrations have taken place so far in the Zurich lab with occasional appearances given abroad, such as Google IO 2012.While the team used motion capture technology extensively over this period, this type of localization technology proved inadequate for a long-running Broadway production when taken out of the research laboratory. The fundamental issue is that motion capture systems rely on a centralized architecture whereby all commands are forwarded to a single computer. A failure in that computer\u2019s hardware or software may cause a sudden loss of control for the complete fleet.Whereas an occasional failure of this type may be inconsequential in a research environment like the Flying Machine Arena, it is unacceptable for most commercial and industrial applications. The live events industry, in particular, has high safety standards owing in part to the amplification of safety risks when performing close to crowds of people. In addition to the safety risks, the consequences of a mishap entailing personal injury can be severe in terms of negative publicity, brand damage, and litigation.An alternative vision based system was used by Britain\u2019s Got Talent show where quadcopters used onboard cameras reading floor patterns to orient themselves. The number of quadcopters permitted is limited by occlusion once a critical level of vehicle density is reached. Furthermore, these systems can be compromised by external show-related light sources (e.g., stage lighting, spotlights), or even from the audience (e.g., laser pointers, flash-light photography), risking loss of control of some or all the vehicles; a major safety concern.To address these shortcomings, Verity Studios moved away from vision-based localization and developed a new system specifically for industrial applications that must meet strict safety and reliability standards. As stated by Raffaello D\u2019Andrea at a recent TED talk, both the new radio-frequency based proprietary localization system and the flying machines are redundant and use fail-safe algorithms such that every vehicle can withstand any single point of failure.Another key factor in the system\u2019s success is its interoperability within a theatrical environment. Any theatrical system must function within a complex ecosystem of stage automation where stringent industry standards prevail.\u201cThese flying machines have met or exceeded all expectations in terms of safety, reliability, maintenance, and ease of operation,\u201d states Michael Shepp, Automation Carpenter for Paramour.The technological achievement of creating a safe and robust system for flying a multitude of vehicles before a live audience introduces a rich palette for artistic expression. Creative staff at Cirque du Soleil recognized this potential and have worked side-by-side with Verity Studios to achieve this milestone on Broadway.Cirque du Soleil Chief Creative Officer, Jean-Francois Bouchard, states: \u201cThe flying machines are unquestionably one of the most important statements of the Paramour show.\u201dCirque du Soleil and Verity Studios are currently exploring the artistic use of flying machines in other upcoming productions.PARAMOUR runs at the Lyric Theatre (213 West 42nd Street) in New York.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportRobohub is a non-profit online communication platform that brings together experts in robotics research, start-ups, business, and education from across the globe.Go to Robohub.org \u00bb",

      "content": "Re-joining the ranks, Sony announced a return to robotics. Momentum is opening a robot hamburger shop. And Starship is beginning to delivery food to 3 cities in Europe.At a recent stockholders meeting, Sony Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai said that Sony, a conglomerate that has divisions in finance, network services and entertainment in addition to hardware, planned to move toward a more ambitious future and that robotics will play a role in that journey.\u201cWe need to push the envelope to really grow Sony into other parts in all of the electronics business, where we know we could make a difference,\u201d Mr. Hirai told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. \u201cYou can have all these great services and content, but there is a device you need to enjoy it, or actually to feed information to the network,\u201d he said.Hirai also said that Sony is planning a new wave of consumer robots that will be able to bond with humans suggesting that Sony will begin selling a competing line of products to SoftBank Robotics' Pepper home robots, Jibo, and Amazon's Alexa line. Sony already has an extensive electronics line including GoPro and drone add-on gimbals, cameras and other devices. Years ago Sony developed the Aibo robotic dog - a charming interactive product that sold 150,000 units from 1999 to 2006. Toward the end, Sony upgraded Aibo to use a camera to recognize its owner and added extra personalities to its repetoire of moves and responses. Competiting companies, particularly Dongbu Robot, a Korean company, use newer technology - and lower costs - to offer Aibo-like toy robot dogs.The business model for new Sony robotic products involves selling a robot that requires a reoccurring subscription service for data and maintenance with frequent software updates - a similar plan to Pepper.A June San Francisco area Craigslist ad advertised for a restaurant generalist to work at a Folsom Street store selling robot-made hamburgers. The store, at 680 Folsom Street, is on the ground floor of a 14-story office building, south of Market Street in the heart of San Francisco.\"This location will feature the world-premiere of our proprietary and remarkable new advances in technology that enable the automatic creation of impossibly delicious burgers at prices everyone can afford. The burgers sold at 680 Folsom will be fresh-ground and grilled to order, served on toasted brioche, and accented by an infinitely personalizable variety of fresh produce, seasonings, and sauces.\" Editorial comment: Wow! What a mouthful!SF is home to the popular automat-style restaurant Eatsa which takes orders for quinoa bowls via iPad and places them in cubby-holes ready for payment and pickup. The ordering process for Eatsa is to walk up to an iPad and construct and pay for your order whereupon it gets delivered to a cubby earmarked for you. It is likely that Momentum plans something similar for its new as-yet unnamed hamburger store, perhaps with a more personal delivery method combining other items like drinks and fries.Starship, a 55-person Estonian Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) startup funded by two of the founders of Skype, has been testing a mobile delivery robot in 12 countries for the last nine months. The devices have traveled 5,000 miles and met over 400,000 people according to Starship's Marketing and Comms Manager. We have learnt a lot in those 5000 miles of testing!  We learned that 60-65% of people don't pay the robot any attention. The robot integrates in public life a lot easier than we thought it would. The remaining % of people are overwhelmingly positive. We were also of course trial-ing the technology and the reliability of the robots. In all of these tests, we were pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe tests were conducted mainly in Tallinn, Estonia and London. We also tested in many other countries including the US, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Spain, etc. \n\n[Regarding our new trial], we haven't changed much, apart from putting more robots onto the streets for testing. We want to increase the number of miles driven on sidewalks around the world to get even more accurate data.  The major difference between our new testing program in UK, Germany and Switzerland is that, for the first time in our history, we are signing up commercial partners like Just Eat. This enables us to enter into a new phase of testing and start doing real world deliveries in real world environments. [In answer to a question as to the cost of the robot devices] We are a delivery company, and therefore it is unlikely we will be selling the robots. We will be providing a delivery service which includes the robots, the maintenance, the human oversight and everything inbetween! All for a monthly fee! \nStarship will be working with London food delivery startup Pronto as well as German parcel company Hermes and the Metro Group of retailers, plus Just Eat restaurant food delivery to trial on-your-schedule-delivery of packages, groceries and meals.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

Just last week Uber announced a strategic partnership - which included an investment of an undetermined amount - with Toyota.Uber has taken a $3.5 billion investment from a government that effectively prohibits women from driving\u2014let alone driving for Uber. Uber also has accepted a $3.5 billion investment from a government that requires women to have male guardians. Uber also has accepted a $3.5 billion investment from a government whose court system has sentenced men to jail time and corporal punishment for the \"crime\" of homosexuality\u2014not to mention all of the harsh sentences, sometimes including death, for political protest.Moreover, this is no passive investment. By naming political appointee Al Rumayyan, the company has basically invited the Saudi government into its board room. To my knowledge, no other Silicon Valley startup has a director from the sovereign wealth fund of a repressive political regime.Uber needed the money, and where else are you going to get $3.5 billion? No doubt, it must be tough to fundraise after you've already tapped out venture capitalists, private equity firms, mutual funds, hedge funds, Wall Street high-net worth clients, and strategic corporate and other sovereign wealth funds (yes, including from noxious Qatar). But there is another option: Go public.

      "content": "Industrial robots used to be dumb, somewhat inflexible, and mostly blind - but also fast, precise and very efficient.  As the cost of components, sensors and vision systems has been dropping, vision-enabled robots are becoming more prevalent and capable, and the industry is dramatically changing.Those changes can be seen in recent trends in China, investments in and acquisitions of robotic companies, by an analysis of recent startup companies, new and widening application areas for robot use, and technological developments.For the past 50+ years industrial robots have picked the low-hanging fruit of manufacturing by handling the dull, dirty and dangerous tasks. But today, as consumers want more personalized products, and want them faster, and as costs have dropped and executives have pushed for greater productivity through automation, mobile and vision-enabled robots are emerging and being deployed in many new application areas, particularly for SMEs and in logistics, but also in government, agriculture, surveying, construction and healthcare.An analysis of 752 of The Robot Report's global database of robotics-related startup companies shows that 25% of the startups were focused on industrial robotics and 75% address new areas of robotics such as: unmanned aerial, land and underwater devices for filming, marketing, delivery, surveillance, security, surveying, and for the military, science and oil and gas industries (25%); robotics for the agriculture industry (6%); mobile robots as platforms for various uses (7%); personal service bots (3%); professional service bots (7%); medical, surgical and rehabilitation robots (7%); consumer products such as for home cleaning, security, remote presence and entertainment (9%); educational and the hobby market (5%); etc. Support businesses such as AI and software, engineering and design, component manufacturing, 3D printing, vision systems and integrators make up the remainder. More than half of the startups are predominently software based and indicative of the new metric that the hardware component represent less that 1/3 of the overall cost of the product.The industrial robotics sector, whose revenues have represented 75% of the industry's overall sales (as reported by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR)) for the past few years, is forecast by various sources including the IFR to have double-digit compounded annual growth for the remainder of this decade. However, when one studies the figures for the biggest five user-countries, all except China are projecting CAGRs of 6% to 9% while China is expected to exceed 25%. Service robots are also expecting double-digit growth with over 80% of those new companies located in Europe and North America. This explosive growth in service robotics, plus the steady growth in industrial robotics, is suggesting that the next 5-10 years will all be double-digit years for the industry as a whole.Certainly we've all seen some of the reports about this growth and how it will transform work. For example, Oxford Martin School researchers estimate that robotics and artificial intelligence are on track to take over 40% of the US workforce within 15-20 years either as a computer program that will be able to do what many of us do today, or it will be a machine or robot that replicates the physical process of work that we do.With the hope of staying within the world of facts rather than forecasts, I suggest the following five trends as representing drivers propelling forward movement in the robotics industry:China's economy has and continues to transition through all the economic stages of industrialization, urbanization and consumption-driven growth. This movement is both politically stimulated and self-propelling. In the realm of robotics, there are many factors driving growth: a desire to export cars requiring a level of quality that can only be provided by utilizing proven robotic automation methods; multi 5-year governmental incentive plans fostering a home-grown robotics industry; rising wages changing the metrics of human-robot deployment; and general availability of capable factory workers.Thus China is eating up the market both as a buyer and an emerging seller. However, for Chinese companies to fully capture the robotic market within China they will have to shore up missing components that are hard to make and improve quality and precision overall. Components such as end-of-arm tools, speed reducers and harmonic drives will need to be manufactured locally instead of being imported. Many retired Japanese engineers are \"consulting\" to help speed up the process. Chinese venture firms are helping by acquiring international companies, investing in Chinese companies that are attempting to perfect these components, and investing in global companies and reorienting them toward sales and manufacturing in China. One good result: as the industry moves in-country, there will be less blatent thievery, copying and reverse engineering as there has been in the past.China's government has encouraged this in-country market by providing loans and other incentives to companies and to local governments to get them to provide real estate and tax incentives. An industry plan drafted by several ministries, for 2016 to 2020, aims to have 100,000 industrial robots produced annually by domestic companies, with annual sales of 30 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) a year. Meanwhile, more than 40 new robot \u00adindustrial parks have been built or are under construction according to the CRIA, adding that local governments established ~80 policies to support the sector.There have been many reports about the misuse of those funds and the falsification of progress reports. The most recent is the 2015 statistics from the IFR showing that even though China did well, the rate of growth has diminished and projections have been halved. See Industrial robot sales for 2015 set new record in spite of troubles in China. Nevertheless, internalization is ongoing and progressively gaining traction. The bid for half the shares of German robot maker Kuka by a Chinese venture firm is an example. Foxconn's deployment of over 45,000 Foxbots (Foxconn's inhouse brand of robots) in addition to robots from other manufacturers is another.Much has been said about the fast-growing market for collaborative robots. The most current are articles describing car companies replacing old-style industrial robots with a combination of humans and co-bots assisting humans to gain needed flexibility. The websites of Universal Robots (UR) and Rethink Robotics both contain numerous video use-cases in a variety of application areas. Bottom line: this is a viable and growing segment of the robotics industry started by UR but with competition coming from Kuka, ABB and others. The major benefits of these new co-bots are their flexibility, safety, ability to be rapidly deployed, and ease of training. Improvements on each of these benefits will keep pressure on pricing as can be seen by the new low-cost Franka robots and the forthcoming rebranded Roberta robot. Also, at AUTOMATICA, held in Munich this June, every robot manufacturer was touting their safe collaborative robots even when, by any stretch of the imagination, they didn't really have one.Turning co-bots into a commodity may not be good for profits but it is good for businesses, particularly those wanting to take their first step into using robots.In a recent research project on robotics in the agriculture industry, a very cost-sensitive industry, many companies are offering services utilizing robots - instead of selling the robots and having the farmer operate them. Thinning, weeding, spraying, aerial imaging and analytics are examples of the services being offered.This concept of offering services instead of the products used in providing the services is and has been a way to introduce untested products into the marketplace but many enterprising startups are finding economies of scale benefit the service provider. Using drones to capture sensor and camera data and then developing software to analyze that data and translate it into actionable plans has crossed industry boundaries and is being offered not only to ag companies but to oil and gas companies, and NGOs and governments wishing to monitor hard-to-get-to areas. Security companies are beginning to offer RaaS to supplement, augment and replace interior security, etc.There is also a blurring of the line between real robots that perform tasks in physical space and software bots that perform a virtual robot-like service. As a consequence, many companies and service providers are going beyond offering SDKs (software development kits for the making of apps) to opening up their APIs (application protocol interface) so that these new bots can increase their scope and effectiveness and make it easier for their users. Apple just announced that they are opening up their APIs and Amazon has been encouraging developers to take advantage of their Echo and Alexa conversational voice recognition systems. This is helping many new startups offer RaaS using customized Alexa-enabled Echo-like devices. An example is the Belgium startup Zora Robotics which is using Amazon's Echo/Alexa system - and software of their own - in various robots to provide services into the health and eldercare marketplace.Better and lower cost vision systems, particularly low-cost 3D vision, navigation and mobility are enabling a variety of existing and startup companies to offer enhanced material handling methods for factories, warehouses and distribution centers. During the financial crisis, capital expenditures for logistics were put off because existing systems seemed to be able to handle the load. But all that changed as we came back from the crisis and consumers wanted their products faster and warehouses couldn't keep up without massive investments in new tech, new methods and, in many cases, new vendors. Further, these new technologies had to accommodate existing facilities and systems; few companies are building new warehouses; they are instead, changing their methods and systems.Upstarts like Amazon/Kiva, and startups like MiR, Clearpath, Aethon, and Fetch are joining established companies like Swisslog, Grenzebach, FMC and many others as they attempt to bring new tech to help speed up the picking process and the movement of picked items to the packing/shipping stations.The Robot Report reported that in 2015 investment activity, 55 startups received funding totaling $1.32 bn; that 32 acquisitions occured totaling $2.27 bn (for those reporting amounts); and that there was one IPO. 2016, through mid-June, shows 56 startups received $427.5 million; and that 20 acquisitions have happened thus far totaling $4.53 bn (from the 11 reporting amounts involved). If the $3.5 bn Uber funding from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund isn't objected to, and the bid for 49% of Kuka for $2.5 billion is accepted, the figures are much higher.Of particular interest are the investments in Western robotic technology by Chinese investors: the bid by Midea to buy 49% of Kuka, KraussMaffei by ChemChina; Paslin by Wanfeng and Gimatic by Agic Capital. China is definitely on an acquisitions spree.China is also stimulating in-country growth. For example, Tsinghua Holdings, a state-owned fund founded in 2003 by Tsinghua University, kicked off two projects announced at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin. One focuses on helping startups and the other on commercializing scientific findings. The fund will set up 1,000 business incubators in China by 2021 and another 50 in nations including the U.S., the U.K. and Germany. The size of a parent fund will exceed $3 billion.\u201cOur goal is to cultivate 500 startups that are valued at more than $15 million within the next five years. China is still lagging in terms of indigenous and core technologies, and there needs to be some companies to act as pioneers and push ahead with innovation.\u201dAdditional information regarding funding, investments and China can be found here.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

Their new HD drone starts at $380, and the 4K video model at $450. Both directly compete - at half the price - with DJI's popular Phantom drones.The new Mi Drone can fly for 27 minutes and has a range of almost 2 miles. DJI drones fly for 23-28 minutes depending on the model. The Mi Drone includes a 360-degree camera that can shoot 4K video, and handheld remote which has the option of attaching a smartphone for a streaming view from the drone. Similar to other Xiaomi products, the company didn\u2019t actually create the Mi Drone itself. Instead it is working with a China-based startup, Flymi, which designed and developed the UAV. Xiaomi is arranging the manufacturing and branding and selling it via its channels, which include its Mi.com online store. Any information on Flymi would be appreciated, particularly a link to their website.Xiaomi recently bought 1,500 technology patents from Microsoft in a deal that may smooth potential legal tangles over intellectual property as Xiaomi begins selling outside of China. The IP covers wireless communications, video, cloud and multimedia technologies. The acquisition came as part of a broader agreement under which Microsoft Office and Skype will come pre-installed on Xiaomi smartphone devices.[Note that many of Xiaomi's executive and technical team previously worked for Microsoft China.]\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "\nMay was another big month for robotics - 13 companies were funded to the tune of $111 million. Four companies were acquired with 2 of the 4 reporting selling prices totaling $422 million. And that\u2019s without the $5.2 billion bid for Kuka by Chinese Midea, or the pending sale of Google's Boston Dynamics.UPDATE: June 1, 2016: Forbes wrote today that Toyota is in discussions with Google not only for Boston Dynamics but also for Schaft, the Japanese startup that won the DARPA Robotics Challenge -- a two-company sale.The financial pages are lighting up over recent stories about these big-money sales. First there was the $5.2 billion offer by Midea Group, a Chinese appliance manufacturer, for Kuka AG, the Augsburg, Germany-based manufacturer of robots and automated systems. Kuka is one of the Big Four of robot manufacturers. On the day of the bid, Kuka's stock rose from $84/share to $110 where it's stayed since.Then came the announcement by Tech Insider that the Toyota Research Institute is in the final phase of negotiations to acquire Google's robotics company Boston Dynamics, of Big Dog fame. Boston Dynamics spun out of the MIT Leg Lab in 1992 and worked on various military and DARPA funded research projects until Google's Andy Rubin acquired the company along with 8 other robotics companies. Boston Dynamics never quite adapted to Google and Google's push to build a consumer robot, hence their being put on the block in March, 2016.From Forbes, news of a new fund focusing on robotics: Chrysalix VC, a Vancouver, BC venture capital group focused on alternative energy, has partnered with Dutch robotics commercialization center RoboValley to create a new VC fund focused on robotics. The vehicle is targeting E100 million.Below are the fundings, acquisitions, IPOs and failures that actually happened in May:\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Artificial intelligence that programs itself on the fly - from the team that developed Siri at SRI and Apple - was demonstrated this week in New York and it quickly performed complex spoken tasks, live and onstage. At the recent TechCrunch Disrupt event, held in New York City May 9-11, Dag Kittlaus unveiled Viv, the new single-source cross-platform voice assistant for the thousands of apps available to us. Viv describes itself as an AI platform that enables developers to distribute their products through an intelligent, conversational interface. Kittlaus expects to offer Viv SDKs to developers in the fall and hopes to fully launch by the end of 2016.In the video below of his 14-minute presentation and demo, with another 10 minutes of Q&A afterwards, one can easily imagine how Viv will soon become integral to the way we use and operate our apps. Viv provides a paradigm shift in the way we effect our daily tasks -- the very shift that others are attempting to provide in the form of personal assistants. It is a breakthrough accomplishment in providing a single conversational user interface (UI) to recognize our words, determine our intent, and then write code to effect that intent. As a side benefit, the video is very informative about the process of AI. [Forward to 4:00 and watch for 10 minutes just to see the demos and skip the intro and Q&A.]Jibo, Pepper, Alexa, Duer, Cortana, Google, Watson and many others (startups are popping up every few days) are all in various stages of presenting and bringing to market their versions of personal assistants - some physical, others virtual.But the Viv demo - done live - was speedier than any and Kittlaus explained why: because as more and more apps become available, and as more and more users want to use some of those apps, a personal assistant must scale to handle all those functions and the larger the scale, the more complex it becomes, the more lines of code that must be written, and it ultimately will slow down. Conversely Viv has a dynamic program generator that writes solution-based code from the intent of the user. In other words, Viv's AI parses through the words you say to determine intent and then writes only the software that meets the specific task requested and does it quickly. The video also shows, but doesn't detail, how Viv determines intent (goals) from the words. It breaks down the conversation into goals and values within thereby instructing the dynamic program generator which apps are required and what the parameters are for those apps.Is Viv going to eliminate Google as the middleman? Kittlaus says that search isn't going anywhere but as Viv and other new AI assistants become more capable and become the primary resource for users, people really won't want to go back to the old way.Siri, co-founded by SRI's Dag Kittlaus and Adam Cheyer and by Tom Gruber, was spun-out from the SRI International Artificial Intelligence Center and acquired by Apple for $200 million in 2010. Kittlaus left Apple in 2011; Cheyer left in 2012.Personal assistants are all about simplifying the process of performing daily tasks. They are attempting to be what you would expect of a knowledgeable executive assistant working alongside to maximize your productivity and minimize your involvement, a person who really knows you and doesn't need you to reexplain things over and over. The list of vendors is impressive: Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, Baidu, Microsoft, Apple, SoftBank, all the car companies, many large consumer product providers and smaller companies like Jibo. To date, none have achieved that sweet spot where end users are fully satisfied.The holdup has been the software, the need for extensive coding, and the ability to identify \"intent\" from sounds recognized as words. The breakthrough technology that Viv is offering is a way to change the way programmers work with computers and developers offer their products. Programmers will no longer have to instruct step-by-step procedures in rigid code, but instead they'll just have to describe the process and intent and the AI will develop the code - it will write the programs needed on the fly.  And developers will just need to add Viv as their conversational UI.[Viv uses Nuance for voice recognition. Nuance is a member of the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index (of which I am a Co-founder).\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "May and June offer two important trade shows and conferences for professional and personal service robotics: Innorobo, held in Paris May 24-26 and AUTOMATICA, held June 21-24 in Munich.Innorobo, which began as a regional show in Lyon, France, has become a steady and growing conference and show focusing on service robotics, has 100 exhibitors, and has changed its venue to Paris to handle that growth. Although far smaller than AUTOMATICA, Innorobo is highly focused on service robotics, startups and disruptive technological innovations -- on social robots, mobile robots, AI and distributed intelligence for robotics, remote presence, commercial drones, and collaborative robotics.AUTOMATICA, is a massive trade fair for automation and mechatronics with a special focus on professional service robotics. Over 800 exhibitors in an immense exhibition space, a 150-presentation symposium on robotics with speakers from both industry and science, and focused on covering service robotics, man-robot collaboration, machine vision, even a Makeathon competition \u2014 everything related to robotics and automation. Only happens every other year -- and this is the year!Excerpted liberally from The Robolution: Are We Walking the Talk? by Catherine Simon, Innorobo founder, President and CEO.Wikipedia described robotics as a \u201cGeneral Purpose Technology,\u201d a GPT, which can effect an entire economy and has the potential to radically change society through its impact on pre-existing economic and social structures. The examples of GPTs given are the steam engine, electricity, the automobile and, of course, the Internet.It is clear that robotics technologies provide potential solutions to our major societal challenges. Precision agriculture is helping to save our planet, and robotics technologies applied to the energy, recycling and waste management sectors can transform the way we consume natural resources by optimizing our use and distributing it based on real needs. Medical and healthcare robotics can eliminate the word \u201cdisability\u201d from our vocabulary and give new autonomy to our elderly citizens. The list goes on and on. In industry, do we really need to produce more at a lower cost or rather give humans back a sense of pride in their profession and know-how while making their work less physically demanding?While technology is a means, it is not there to give us meaning. Robotics technologies are going to continue to advance with, if we believe Moore\u2019s Law, an \u201cinflection point\u201d in the next 10 to 20 years, followed by rapid progress, and with the aim to improve the lives of all citizens while preserving our planet for sustainable humanity.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "iRobot recently divested its defense division so that it could focus on consumer and mobility products. Red Mountain Capital, a hedge fund that owns ~6% of iRobot stock wants to place two people on the iRobot board to effect some change.Red Mountain Capital has forced iRobot into a battle over management direction, a fight described in detail in a story by Jon Chesto of The Boston Globe: IRobot CEO faces what could be his biggest test: a heated proxy battle over company\u2019s future.Red Mountain considers itself to be an activist shareholder - and wants to play a more direct role in how iRobot is run, how iRobot funds are allocated to R&D, how expenses are controlled, and how much is returned to shareholders. iRobot thinks it is successfully handling strategic planning, product development, return on equity, and prudent manufacturing operations without adding extra financial advice from non-industry people to the mix.The Globe article, describing iRobot's planning for the future, describes iRobot's Venture Group and their investments in future companies within the mobility, consumer and home marketplaces - all areas where iRobot has expertise. One investment is particularly interesting and offers the prospect of much growth for iRobot as well as the startup: 6 River Systems, a Massachusetts startup comprised of ex-Kiva Systems execs. 6 River is providing a mobile robot solution for material handling in warehouses, factories and distribution centers. It's a big marketplace particularly since Amazon has taken the Kiva technology in-house with the consequence that new vendors (such as 6 River) are scrambling to fill the void.In the Boston Globe article I was quoted as summarizing the iRobot / Red Mountain proxy fight as follows:\u201cFrom time to time, any company really can use a shake-up. But you can shake up the company [iRobot] just by talking to Colin,\u201d Tobe said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to put two hedge-fund, money-type people on the board.\u201dFrom the chart above one can see that iRobot's share of the global robot floor cleaning market is 63% of units and 40% of revenue, and shows year-over-year gains of 8.3% for units and 9.3% for revenue.The robot segment of the overall home vacuum cleaner market has also been growing. Colin Angle, iRobot co-founder, Chairman and CEO, used this chart in a 2014 presentation:Thus one can see that robotic vacuum sales are becomming more popular but at a lower growth rate than the general vacuum market growth rate. And from Angle's presentation slide, it's clear that although iRobot has a goodly share of the market, their revenue could be higher and their overall capture rate is going down instead up.The following three research reports vary widely but all show double-digit growth within the robotic sector of the global home vacuum market.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Most car companies are remaking themselves into tech startups as they move toward offering fully autonomous self-driving vehicles. Yet thousands of tractors already use self-driving kits as do hundreds of tugs, lifts and trucks. Self-driving aftermarket kits are beginning to be offered in multiple markets. What's going on?Cruise Automation just got acquired by GM for $1 billion. Up until now Cruise was known as the developer of a $16,000 aftermarket kit to turn select cars into self-driving cars. Does GM want to supplement their parts business with self-driving kits? Or did they spend all that money to acquire talent?Cruise Automation isn't the only kit developer: Comma.ai promises a $1,000 kit by the end of this year and just got a $3.1 million seed round of funding; Perrone Robotics is already selling a high-end kit for R&D and testing with funding from DARPA and the IIHS. Other companies are listed below. What's going on? Are aftermarket kits really that much in demand? Media today seems most focused on suggesting that the industry is quickly moving toward preventing crashes from ever occuring instead of just protecting occupants from crashes even though there are many other reasons for self-driving (eg, fuel efficiency, lowering carbon emissions, enabling safe transportion for the elderly, and improving traffic congestion).From an interview in Wired of Andrew Ng, Chief Scientist of Baidu; and Chairman and Co-Founder of Coursera.I think self-driving cars are a little further out than most people think. There\u2019s a debate about which one of two universes we\u2019re in. In the first universe it\u2019s an incremental path to self-driving cars, meaning you have cruise control, adaptive cruise control, then self-driving cars only on the highways, and you keep adding stuff until 20 years from now you have a self-driving car. In universe two you have one organization, maybe Carnegie Mellon or Google, that invents a self-driving car and bam! You have self-driving cars. It wasn\u2019t available Tuesday but it\u2019s on sale on Wednesday.I\u2019m in universe one. I think there\u2019s a lot of confusion about how easy it is to do self-driving cars. There\u2019s a big difference between being able to drive a thousand miles, versus being able to drive anywhere. And it turns out that machine-learning technology is good at pushing performance from 90 to 99 percent accuracy. But it\u2019s challenging to get to four nines (99.99 percent).As car companies move in the direction of providing self-driving cars, most have proprietary roadmaps and big needs for software and other engineering talent. They have all set up research facilities in Silicon Valley and throughout academia. The Wall Street Journal mapped car company locations in Silicon Valley (shown below) which attests to their proliferation. Not included on this map are the new tech startups profiled in this article.Because the auto industry is so much larger and visible to the consumer public, the remainder of this article will focus on self-driving kits and other software and AI offered to the auto, transportation and trucking industries, as well as to the consumer aftermarket.Perhaps the Deere tractor example applies to cars. Deere has had self-driving, autonomous, cab-less concept tractors such as the one shown on the right available for discussion and possible sale but thus far they haven't replaced the self-driving kits which they have been selling for 15 years. Farmers want the air-conditioned and cushioned cabin on their tractors to house all the monitors and other computer and automation technologies for the implements the tractors are towing. They want to remain in charge and the cab has become the hub of computerized farm automation. They say they are waiting for the right time - when fully autonomous tractor systems provide all the services they want and need. And that time is far off in the future.Maybe car drivers want to remain in charge but are willing to have fun experimenting with low-cost partial self-driving kits or incremental add-on features on new cars until the time - far off in the future - when fully trustworthy autonomous self-driving vehicles take over the transportation marketplace. Maybe the public isn't ready yet to fully trust cars, trucks and buses without drivers. Perhaps self-driving kits are an interim step along the way. \u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

Today single-purpose devices, combining sensors with software and data analytics components, have the potential to radically automate the physical world around us -- eliminating \"dirty, dull & dangerous\" tasks from our lives and, thus, realizing the ultimate purpose of robotics. The investment focus of the new fund reflects this vision, as Grishin Robotics looks to fund both hardware & software companies, driven by the six pillars of the Hardware Revolution -- (1) cheaper components, (2) ubiquitous connectivity, (3) smartphone penetration, (4) 3D printing, (5) disruption of supply chain and (6) crowdfunding. By 2020, total value of the markets driven by these changes, is estimated to reach $1 trillion.The new fund will be primarily focused on Series A & B deals, with a certain amount of capital reserved for seed and later-stage opportunities -- such as Ring, a web-based video doorbell consumer product, whose Series C round was the first investment from the new fund. Grishin Robotics is looking to expand its B2B focus as well as B2C, and will allocate up to $10 million over the lifecycle of portfolio startup companies.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "In March 2012, in an effort to make their distribution centers (DCs) as efficient as possible, Amazon acquired Kiva Systems for $775 million and almost immediately took them inhouse.UPDATED 4/19/2016 to add Swisslog and Grenzebach as fulfillment systems providersThere was confusion after the acquisition whether Kiva would continue providing DCs with Kiva robots. Although Kiva said that they would continue selling their technology to other retailers it soon became clear that Amazon was taking all Kiva's production and that, at some future date, Kiva would stop supporting their existing client base and focus entirely on Amazon - which happened in April 2015 when Amazon renamed Kiva to Amazon Robotics and encouraged prospective users of Kiva technology to let Amazon Robotics and Amazon Services provide fulfillment within Amazon warehouses using Amazon robots.Consequently there has been a scramble of new providers to fill the void left by Kiva's technology, warehouse software systems and robots being removed from the marketplace. Many of these startups were showing their robotic systems at MODEX 2016 held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta. MODEX is a big material handling equipment, technology and systems show with 850 exhibitors, 250,000 sq ft (23,225 sq mt) of expo space, 100 informational seminars and over 25,000 attendees.Kiva's robots and inventory management system were breakthrough technologies in 2011 and 2012 enabling items that were to be shipped to be brought to the packer near the truck door instead of the more traditional method of the picker/packer going out into the warehouse, picking the goods, and returning to pack and ship them. At the time Kiva started operations, robotic picking was still a premature science, consequently Kiva focused on managing the rest of the process: receiving, depalletizing and storing items and bringing dynamically-stored shelves containing ordered items to the picker/packer to pick, pack and ship while the Kiva robot returned the shelves to the most appropriate area in a free-form dynamic warehouse and autonomously went off to bring the next shelf to another picker/packer.[To read the details about how a Kiva robot is made, click here.]Although vision systems and grasping technologies have improved since then, they still aren't fast and flexible enough to replace humans so, instead, most new systems attempt to augment humans by reducing what they have to carry and the distances they have to travel to get the items that were ordered.Mobile platform systems are designed to work across multiple environments - DCs, warehouses, factories - and are autonomous mobile platforms that can be fitted with special-purpose payloads such as for receiving, restocking, inventory, moving material from work cell to work cell, picking, supporting human pickers, packing and palletizing. Many vendors have provided AGVs, carts, lifts and tows, and have done so for many years. The older versions of these systems use markings, tapes, beacons, sensors and other things on the floors and ceilings to provide location information. Newer systems use the latest 3D vision systems, collision avoidance and mapping software to easily enable autonomous point-to-point navigation.Seegrid calls today's vision guided vehicles the next generation of AGVs. Many vendors have, for years, provided material handling AGVs used to tow carts and pallets around warehouses, hospitals and factories. They depend upon beacons or floor and wall markings for their navigation and are efficient but klutzy.Erik Nieves, who previously was Director of Technology for US Yaskawa Motoman and is now in stealth mode with his startup Plus One Robotics, said:Armed with lower-cost LiDARs and Kinnect-like infrared 3D camera systems, new players like Aethon and Seegrid entered the market with new capabilities - including being able to autonomously unload containers: vision guided robotic lifts, tugs and platforms.As an aside, Seegrid recently held a contest to acknowledge journalists covering the materials handling industry and they awarded The Robot Report third place at an Awards Celebration event held after hours at MODEX in Atlanta.

      "content": "iRobot has been streamlining its operations to focus on consumer products and enhancing shareholder value. Recent moves to divest their defense division, launch a low-cost Braava Jet floor cleaner, and investing in 6 River Systems all attest to their strategy.In a February transaction valued at $45 million, iRobot sold its Defense and Security division to Arlington Capital Partners. The divestiture ends iRobot's dual focus on the military and consumer markets and ends a multi-year revenue slide in the defense division. The sale was a strategically planned transition as the Iraq and Afghanistan wars wound down.Colin Angle, iRobot Chairman and CEO, said: \"In the spring of 2014, we engaged Blackstone Advisory Partners LP, now known as PJT Partners, to review strategic alternatives for our Defense and Security business. After a thorough and deliberate process, we've concluded the sale of the business to Arlington Capital Partners will maximize shareholder value by allowing us to focus on our much larger Home segment.Earlier this month iRobot launched the Braava Jet Mopping Robot to add to their wet floor care business and to generate a new revenue stream beyond the Roomba line of vacuum products. The new robot is small -- about 6\" square and 3\" high -- with a nifty carrying handle -- and focused on cleaning hardwood floors and tight spaces by dry mopping, damp mopping (uses 60% of water compared to wet mode), and wet mopping. Each mode has a unique pad easily snapped onto the bottom of the robot (and snapped off over the trash bin) and identified by the robot as to which of the three functions it is to perform. The new little robot's best feature, however, is its low price: $199.The Braava Jet is to be marketed heavily in China where the more expensive previous version of the Braava floor cleaner did quite well in year-over-year sales. In fact, according to CEO Colin Angle in an analysts financial call, said that growth in China was more than 70% year over year in 2015, driven primarily by the successful adoption of previous Braava models given predominately hard floor surfaces in the region. Hence the new lower-priced device is expected to be ideal in both the China and American markets.In a recent letter to shareholders iRobot described its shift in focus toward the high-growth home robot business and by investing in projects that show the greatest promise for outsized returns.iRobot is doing that with its existing and new products but also through its venture arm, iRobot Ventures, which just invested in 6 River Systems, a Boston-based startup of ex-Kiva executives developing fulfillment automation for e-commerce and retail operations. iRobot Ventures previously invested in Petnet, a smart feeder for cats and dogs, and Paracosm, a 3D vision and mapping technology company.As an aside, Red Mountain Capital Partners, a VC which owns 6.1% of iRobot shares, and that invests in undervalued small cap companies and attempts to enhance and realize shareholder value through active ownership, is attempting to add two board members to the iRobot board at the upcoming stockholders meeting. Throughout our nearly year-long engagement with iRobot, it has become clear that the Board will only take action in reaction to significant shareholder pressure. As such, we have nominated individuals who are highly qualified and would bring a much needed shareholder voice to the boardroom. Red Mountain has consistently called for improved Board oversight with respect to the Company\u2019s allocation of capital, cost management, return on invested capital and corporate governance policies,\u201d said Willem Mesdag, Managing Partner of Red Mountain.In the letter to shareholders, iRobot does not recommend these two board members but another two of it's picking while citing that iRobot has delivered total shareholder return of 66% over the past three years compared to 59% for peers and 50% for S&P 500 companies. \u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Forget about Google and Boston Dynamics. This week the real news is that GM acquired small San Francisco based startup Cruise Automation for the rumored sum of more than $1B US, according to Fortune. Robotics has its first unicorn!Note: This article was first posted on Robohub.org and is republished with permission.For the last 3 years, San Francisco startup Cruise Automation has been working on an \u2018after market\u2019 kit to make vehicles self driving. Cruise has previously raised over $18 million in venture funding, on a post-money $90 million valuation. Investors include YCombinator, Spark Capital, Maven Ventures and Founder Collective.Apparently Cruise was in discussion with GM about their next venture round which turned into an acquisition. It would seem that GM is interested less in the after market kit and more in integrating the Cruise team into GM\u2019s core technology development.According to the press release, Cruise will operate as an independent unit within GM\u2019s recently formed Autonomous Vehicle Development Team led by Doug Parks, GM vice president of autonomous technology and vehicle execution, and will continue to be based in San Francisco, where Cruise has been testing its technology in a challenging city environment.\u201cCruise provides our company with a unique technology advantage that is unmatched in our industry. We intend to invest significantly to further grow the talent base and capabilities already established by the Cruise team.\u201d said Mark Reuss, GM executive vice president, Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain.\u201cGM\u2019s commitment to autonomous vehicles is inspiring, deliberate, and completely in line with our vision to make transportation safer and more accessible,\u201d said Kyle Vogt, founder of Cruise Automation. \u201cWe are excited to be partnering with GM and believe this is a ground-breaking and necessary step toward rapidly commercializing autonomous vehicle technology.\u201dAccording to the press release, the acquisition of Cruise is GM\u2019s latest step toward its goal of redefining the future of personal mobility. Since the beginning of the year, GM has entered into a strategic alliance with ride-sharing company Lyft; formed Maven, its personal mobility brand for car-sharing fleets in many U.S. cities, and established a separate unit for autonomous vehicle development.But really, robotics has finally reached the tipping point. In 2014, Silicon Valley Robotics announced that over $1 billion had been invested in robotics in the last 5 years, 2009 to 2014. In 2015, over $1 billion was invested in robotics in a 12 month period, according to Hizook and The Robot Report. And in 2016, over $1 billion has been invested in one single robotics startup, Cruise Automation.Robotics has its first real unicorn. [To be fair, Intuitive Surgical, founded in 1995 and IPO'd in 2000 has a market value of $21.5 billion. But the M&A term \"unicorn\" wasn't coined back then.]Note: This article was first posted on Robohub.org and is republished with permission.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportRead more \u00bb",

      "content": "Parker's Indego exoskeleton received FDA clearance after completing a large clinical trial in the U.S. The study consisted of 1,200+ sessions where participants were able to walk safely on several in- and outdoor surfaces using the exoskeleton.Indego is the result of 10 years of development by engineers at Vanderbilt University funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. In 2012 it was licensed to Parker Hannifin (recently renamed to just Parker) for commercialization and marketing, and is an external skeleton that works by strapping it around the patient's torso; legs are also strapped with supports from the hips to the knees and from the knees to the feet. Computer-controlled motors act as knee and hip joints. Patients use forearm crutches to keep their balance.The international group of exoskeleton providers with various FDA or CE certifications is growing and includes Ekso in the US, Cyberdyne in the EU and Japan, ExoAtlet from Russia, and Israel's ReWalk. Other providers are in the process of getting those approvals or developing commercial versions of their products and include:Many of these startups are seeking insurance policy and coverage from the related healthcare insurers and agencies in addition to CE and FDA approvals for their devices. Japan's Health Ministry has approved Cyberdyne's HAL exo suit as a medical device which enables it to be paid for by the public health insurance system. Cyberdyne has announced plans to submit a request to the health ministry to make this possible. FDA and CE approvals help insurance review boards rule regarding whether to cover exoskeletons. ReWalk was the first in the US to receive workman's compensation coverage after multiple challenges and reviews. But general health insurance coverage has been slow to approve these new devices either for personal use or even for rehab sessions prescribed by a doctor. In February of this year, in what could be a major turning point for people with spinal cord injuries, a medical review board ruled that a health insurance provider is obligated to provide coverage and reimbursement for a $69,500 ReWalk robotic exoskeleton. The unnamed health plan initially denied coverage, but after an independent review board dug into the beneficiary\u2019s case and the current state of exoskeleton technology, it ruled that the exoskeleton was \u201cmedically necessary.\u201dThe review board determined that the exoskeleton was necessary because it allowed the patient to walk. This ruling implies that walking is not a luxury for patients with spinal injuries, but a right\u2014and that if the technology exists and is mechanically sound, insurance companies must cover them.ReWalk CEO Larry Jasinski was pleased by the decision, stating in a press release, \"Health benefit providers have historically been hesitant to acknowledge the clinical benefits in their case assessments. This ruling, and subsequent coverage and reimbursement, will help ReWalk in our efforts to facilitate greater patient access to the device.\"\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Universal Robots, the Danish manufacturer of a line of collaborative robots (also called \"co-bots\"), recently published financial statements which provide valuable insights into the growth potential of collaborative robots.At present, sales of collaborative robots represent just 5% of the overall robot market. The collaborative robotics sector, according to multiple pay-for research reports, is expected to increase roughly tenfold between 2015 and 2020, reaching over $1 billion from approximately $95 million in 2014. In financial statements released in February, Universal Robots (UR) reported 2015 revenue of $61.44 million, a 91% increase over 2014, and net profit of $9.6 million before taxes for the year, up 122% over 2014. Unit sales, which began in 2009, have risen at around 75% each year to 3,500 in 2015. At year's end, UR employed 150 in Denmark and another 50 worldwide, had 7,000 robots at work in the field, and had a global network of integrators and distributors totaling more than 200.Enrico Krog Iversen, UR's CEO, said he hopes that 2016 sales will exceed 90% and that UR had moved into larger space in 2014 to handle this level of growth. The new facility has a capacity of 33,000 units per year. At just 75% growth each year, as can be seen in the chart above, UR will hit their plant capacity by the end of 2019!Last year Universal Robots sold to Massachusetts-based Teradyne, a publicly-traded provider of electronic testing equipment, for $285 million in cash and $65 million in options. Teradyne, with over 3,900 employees and a product line that doesn't include anything robotic, has a market value of $4.37 billion. Mark Jagiela, President and CEO, said of the acquisition:In regards to the acquisition, Iversen said that Teradyne was opening doors to their customers in the electronics industry which are prime prospects for UR co-bots. Regarding competition, Iversen said, \"Our main competitor is manual labor.\" Stated another way, within the SME community, a big holdup is educating managers, engineers and workers regarding the value, opportunity, employee performance improvement and quick ROI of deploying co-bots as worker assistants. As this educational process progresses and succeeds, co-bot sales will surely follow.As ambitious as UR's fast growth figures and forecasted future sales are, they represent just one co-bot competitor serving millions of SMEs. They don't reflect what the Top 8 robot companies - Fanuc, Yaskawa, ABB, Kawasaki, Nachi, Kuka, Denso, Epson and Adept - have in store. Because each of these companies is publicly held, they are limited in what they can say about the future and don't provide any information about their plans relating to the introduction and marketing of their brand of co-bots. We do know that ABB has a two-armed robot named YuMi (some of which are installed at various Mercedes Benz factories) and a one-armed as-yet unnamed robot which they acquired from gomTec that will be rebranded and launched later this year; Fanuc recently introduced a heavy-lifting co-bot; Kuka has an elegant lightweight but very expensive co-bot; and each of the other vendors (except Yaskawa), have begun to offer various co-bots. Consequently the unit sales forecast in the chart above doesn't reflect any effect from the Top 8 companies.Other co-bots - particularly those that add mobility to their capabilities - are creating new markets for guides, kiosks, store assistants, inventory takers, warehouse and distribution center \"gofors\", and countless other applications including mobile personal assistants such as the SoftBank Pepper robot. Many pay-for research reports suggest that these types of co-bots will grow at around 30% annually - a far cry from UR's growth these past few years - but substantial nonetheless. The SoftBank Robotics Group is producing 1,000 Pepper robots every month and plans to double that number when they begin sales later this year into China.The European robotics initiative for strengthening the competitiveness of SMEs in manufacturing, called SME Robot, was funded by the EU FP6 (Framework Programme 6) and started in March, 2005 (and extended in a successor project in FP7 to June of this year). It was chartered to determine ways to keep labor from being sent offshore to lower labor-cost countries and focused on the large number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at threat of offshoring. [SMEs are defined as manufacturing companies having less than 500 employees. The number of SMEs worldwide is estimated to be 6 million.] The thesis was that if you empowered SME employees with robotic tools, the SME company would become more cost efficient and competitive and therefore not have to be off-shored. Thus the initial marketplace for co-bots was to SMEs.In a parallel development in America beginning in 2008, Rodney Brooks founded Rethink Robotics and began educating American SMEs about the benefits of the Baxter line of robots he was developing. It\u2019s rare that one man can influence a whole universe of stakeholders. But from his network of MIT students and extensive speaking engagements to his various entrepreneurial activities, he has informed and charmed his vision of what robots can do and how people and corporations can benefit. Timing, of course, played a role as have the rapid changes and lowered costs of new sensors and robotic technologies. But throughout, Rod Brooks has defined the need and sold the sizzle of collaborative robots. At first, his product, the Baxter robot, wasn\u2019t able to fulfill his promises. Universal Robots\u2019 robots, however, did \u2013 and their sales took off while Baxter\u2019s stayed minimal. Last year Rethink did a major software upgrade and added a new one-armed robot called Sawyer. Reviews have been favorable for both changes and it appears that Rethink has finally become a real competitor in the co-bots marketplace. (See below for more about Rethink).BMW, which utilizes ~7,500 industrial robots in their factories around the world experimented with UR co-bots last year with significant results. In a human-machine study conducted by an MIT professor, it was shown that teams made of humans and robots collaborating efficiently can be more productive than teams made of either humans or robots alone. They also found that they could increase productivity and also reduce ergonomically challenging tasks done by humans which increased morale and empowered workers with these easily programmed collaborative robots. A BMW spokesman said that, based on the success of these tests, he could foresee doubling or even tripling the number of robots in BMW factories.When I asked UR's Iversen whether he had received a multi-thousand purchase order from BMW subsequent to their tests, he playfully responded by saying, \"BMW is a strong partner.\"Again, in a parallel development at a Mercedes Benz factory in Germany, in an effort to halve the 61 hours it takes to produce a car, Mercedes is shifting to what it calls \u201crobot farming\u201d - equipping workers with an array of smaller, lighter machines and co-bots. Customization is key to Mercedes' marketing and buyers are choosing an ever-increasing array of options causing a need for flexibility not presently available from legacy robots. Humans (and their co-bots) are being added to provide that needed flexibility. While robots won\u2019t completely disappear, they\u2019ll increasingly be smaller and more flexible and operate in conjunction with human workers rather than be off working behind safety fences. \u201cWe\u2019re moving away from trying to maximize automation with people taking a bigger part in industrial processes again,\u201d said Markus Schaefer, Mercedes' head of production. \u201cWe need to be flexible.\u201d This trend toward adding humans augmented with co-bots back into the auto assembly process because of their ability to be more flexible than big industrial robots is being felt in studies at many of the car companies in Germany, Sweden and the UK. But it also broadens the co-bot marketplace by adding factories with more than 500 employees.Rethink has recently been developing an international distribution and integrator network for it's Baxter and Sawyer robots. Along with Sumitomo Corp for Japan and Shanghai Electric for Eastern China, Rethink is working with startup Hunan Cothink Robotics Technology for Northern and Southern China. Cothink will have a capability to integrate, test and install up to 2,000 robots annually. Asia, and particularly China, are integral to Rethink Robotics global expansion plan.Other one- or two-armed co-bot manufacturers include MRK-System GmbH, F&P Personal Robotics, Bosch, MABI Robotic, Smokie Robotics and Kawada Industries. The list of mobile co-bot providers is much more extensive and includes (to mention just a few) companies like Amazon, Fetch, Grey Orange, Harvest Automation, MetraLabs, and many others. These companies, and their primary applications, will be the subject of a future article.There's no doubt that the collaborative robot marketplace will be growing exponentially over the next few years - with UR leading the pack - and price, safety, flexibility and ease of programming being the key determinents as to which vendor(s) are chosen. \u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

On their website they are showing their new Alpha2 - in English - in a revealing video.This Chinese New Year's inclusion of robots and drones - and Japan's focus on showcasing robots and robotics for their Olympics in 2020 - shows their interest in human-like robots and this interest translates into consumer demand. UBTECH and many other startups in China and elsewhere are focusing on taking advantage of that Asian interest with products such as the Alpha robot and the SoftBank Pepper robot. Alpha is smaller than Pepper but they both interact using human speech and are geared to home and social use.

      "content": "CES is truly a global technology event. 3,800 exhibitors (of which 500 were startups); 2.47 million sq feet of exhibit space; 170,000 industry professionals (of which 50,000 were from more than 160 countries including a Cuban delegation)!The key words one heard from passers-by and sales people were: smart; connected; robotic; autonomous; self-driving; drones; IoT (Internet of Things); healthcare; fitness; apps; sensors; cameras; China; Taiwan; AI; headsets; virtual reality; augmented reality; and Mercedes Benz's concept car. Exhibitors attempted to show products that corresponded to those buzzwords and visitors were \"bombarded with early versions of tomorrow's tech that are bound to feel janky and incomplete,\" said Farhad Manjoo in the NY Times. Smart shower heads that reduce water flow when you step away to lather up; smart fridge cameras that give a view of what's inside to your smartphone while you're at the store or to a flat panel screen on the outside door of the fridge; big TVs (some up to 170\" (432cm)) with curved screens; virtual reality headsets; paneled lighting arrays; follow-me drones and carriers of all types; ski airbags (similar to boating life vests); Parrot's new single wing drone (similar to senseFly's eBee); the new Star Wars BB-8 toy from Sphero; wristband follow-me wearables; every type of workout wearable and sensor; avatars with customized faces (can be your face); pet games and food dispensers; makeup mirrors that overlay on your face different makeup combinations; bi-color LED lights for indoor ag farms; huge walls of TV screens showing every type of spectacular scene; face-tracking cameras; and connected cars and their driving, navigation and entertainment systems.The show was organized by areas with sections for 3D Printing, Apps, Augmented Reality, Cyber & Personal Security, eCommerce, Education & Technology, Family & Technology, Fitness & Technology, Gaming & Virtual Reality, HDMI, Health & Wellness, iProducts, Kids & Technology, Robotics, Smart Home, Smart Watches, Sports Tech, Unmanned Systems, Vehicle Intelligence, and Wearables -- essentially the whole gamut of electronic consumer products. Fitness, sports tech, vehicles and their systems, all had particularly mammoth areas.The biggest exhibit spaces included two Chinese companies: Hisense and TCL. Other super-large exhibition spaces were for Samsung (the absolute biggest), LG, Nikon, Canon, Panasonic, Sony, Mercedes, Intel and Qualcomm.The most notable companies NOT exhibiting were Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google and IBM although most had hospitality suites and/or meeting rooms for their ad teams to meet with clients who produced consumer electronic products and IBM's CEO was one of the keynote presenters (see below).In a NY Times article, the serious side of the CES spectacle was highlighted: \"A lot of business gets done at CES, often away from the show floor, in the labyrinthine warrens of meeting rooms across the Las Vegas Strip.\"Very true. Even for companies that didn't exhibit like Twitter and IBM, they all had quiet spaces to demonstrate products, talk pricing and agreements, and generally have time and space for one-on-ones with customers and prospects. Although IBM is no longer in the consumer products business they had a large meeting room set aside for their customers who were. Twitter created a miniature city in two large ballrooms at one of the hotels. It had shops, restaurants, a bar, theater and an outdoor park. Each was a meeting area for Twitter's ad sales team to meet and greet customers.There were more than 25 press conferences held at the show. Many were announcing additional products to an existing product line. A few described new products. And some, like Toyota and Intel, provided pertinent information about profound changes about to happen.Toyota held a press conference led by Gill Pratt of DARPA fame, who now is the CEO of Toyota Research Institute (TRI) wherein he announced their new research staff. One member of that staff was James Kuffner, the previous head of Google's robotics group known as Replicant. His departure continues the robotics shakeup at Google. Details here.Other press events ranged from entertaining to informative and included Yamaha Ventures announcing their cooperation with SRI International to jointly turn Yamaha's MotoBot into a real thinking and navigating robot. \"This project will be able to push several boundaries: visualizing data about human motorcycle operation, further quantifying the relationship between rider input and machine behavior, and then using the resulting know-how to build even better vehicles,\" explains Amish Parashar, Director of Strategic Business Development at Yamaha Motor Ventures and Laboratory Silicon Valley Inc.Intel, IBM, Netflix, General Motors and Volkswagen all had keynote presentations but seats for Intel's were the most highly prized. Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich was the featured speaker and he covered so many topics one really has to watch the whole hour and forty minute presentation to capture the full impact of all that he described. The import of what he said -- that we are moving from a time of transactional systems to one that is experiential -- seems predictive of the next few years in electronics, the digital world, robotics and artificial intelligence. Watch the video above or read the condensed version here.IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty told a packed CES audience that Watson and IBM were changing the nature of data processing from transactional to cognitive and that this process would change computing and lead to providing cognition as a service. IBM describes the cognitive process as providing the 3rd hand for a lab technician, very similar to the experiential descriptor used by Intel's CEO. During Rometty's presentation she described how Watson is working with SoftBank to provide global distribution and support for their Pepper robots. Read the condensed version here.Overzealous marketing can be seen regularly in crowdfunding campaigns. CES was similarly full of examples of ventures claiming to be able to provide something useful when, in fact, they need funding to see whether they can actually do what they are promising. Sometimes these companies hire social media people to help promote those very things using viral marketing in their arsenal of advertising tools. There are many examples but the 2014 Robot Butler campaign is a paradigm classic.In a joint marketing campaign for Quirky, which was promoting their array of smart home sensors, switches and products, and subsidiary Wink's hub that combines them into a smart home, they crafted a catchy video ad suggesting that smart homes were better served by Wink products than by a robotic butler. The video entitled (Like a robot butler, but less awkward) showed a couple in bed being uncomfortable with their robot butler peeking in on them as if it were sentient. The ad was supported by the distribution of a bunch of cardboard shipping boxes for non-existent robot butlers which they dropped off on the streets of San Francisco waiting for trash pickup as if they were the empty boxes of real robot butlers. The promoters hyped sightings of those boxes with lots of blog posts, tweets and other social media and even set up a Robot Butler website.AdWeek finally exposed the situation: \"Well, it turns out this was just a social media sensation. There is no real Robot Butler, at least not this one, and the whole misleading campaign, was just for an app that controls home appliances.\u201cThe company behind the app and marketing was called Wink which is owned by Quirky, a New York-based company that makes Internet-connected devices for the home and other gadgets, and General Electric is an investor in Quirky.\"Quirky is for real and subscribed to Wink's parody marketing campaign based on the Robot Butler. The problem was there was no indication that the robot was a hoax, it was not selling out of stock as claimed, it would not be ready for shipment to consumers, and it was not being reviewed by reputable news sources.\"Quirky recently filed for bankruptcy; the Wink component is being sold off as IP to Flextronics International; the advertising \"parody\" (which, in this case, appeared to be a euphemism for \"phony\") failed; and a real robot butler is still many years off.CES draws huge traffic to the worlds of digital, electronics, robotics, IoT and consumer products. Everyone wants to learn about products and thematic or even paradigm changes that will affect their lives in the near future, and over 6,000 members of the media from all over the world were there to gather that information. Their observations have been - and will be - top news stories for months to come.There will be mistakes made in some of those reports as there was in a recent NPR story about Pepper costing $20k when actually it sells for $2k. Nevertheless, the CES experience is a valuable stimulant for all of us in the various industries that make up the robotics industry.The two keynotes mentioned above, by the CEO's of Intel and IBM, describe a trend from transactional to cognitive to experiential. This has import to the robot industry in a variety of ways.There's no reason to overdo the promotion of future products by falsification, stealing content or otherwise hyping a product beyond it's capabilities or possibilities. People read most of the stories and reports coming out of CES because they want facts about products they may want to buy. They want the truth -- and they can handle the truth.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "CEOs from IBM and Intel, in keynote presentations at CES in Las Vegas last week, described and gave examples of disruptive changes in how consumers and businesses transact and interact with their purchases.Intel's Brian Krzanich described the use of embedded chips and cloud services to enable experience-based transactions, many of which lead to sales but others also lead to enhancing the user's experience. Krzanich provided many examples but four stood out and made his case:\n\nAs an aside, Intel recently announced its acquisition of Ascending Technologies, the German developer of the collision avoidant autopilot system used in the 100 drones video above. Last year Intel also made a big investment in Yuneec, whose drones now include onboard Intel RealSense cameras and chips, and Airware, a competing autopilot developer. And this week Intel invested in robotics startup Savioke, maker of the Relay robot which autonomously navigates around hotels delivering toothpaste, towels, Starbucks coffee and other items. IBM's CEO, Ginny Rometty, told a packed CES audience that Watson and IBM were changing the nature of data processing from transactional to cognitive. Last year Robert High, CTO of IBM's Watson Group, described the emerging era of embodied cognitive computing leading to providing cognition as a service, as a 3rd hand such as a lab technician might need, or as a concierge as Jibo and Echo (and human concierges) offer, as an office assistant might provide, and in field settings like search and rescue. The cognition process involves machines interacting with humans in writing, verbally, with tactile and visual cues, and with gestures. Cognitive algorithms and cloud computing are the keys to Watson's feats and they also happen to be where Rometty has pushed IBM since her tenure began.Rometty described Watson's progress thus far and demonstrated on stage many areas where applying Watson to an application is changing the nature of the experience. It's not enough to just be able to hear what a user says. Watson must be able to understand what they want, be able to make that happen, and then interact back with the user in as conversational a tone as possible. SoftBank's Pepper robot is an example of how this works. In this excerpt from Rometty's presentation, she and SoftBank Robotics' Kenichi Yoshida announced that IBM will provide global distribution and support for SoftBank's Watson-powered Pepper robot as they scale up to begin selling into China and the U.S. Pepper has already sold 7,000 units in Japan and is in 300 bank branches, and 100 stores. These two CES keynote presentations illustrate how artificial intelligence and data synthesis will provide the backbone to enable meaningful and productive interaction between humans and machines -- not only on screens, but with gestures, visual cues and spoken understandable communication to and from smart devices and robots of all types. And it's not just a near-term future they foretell -- they give examples of where it is already happening.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "At a press conference last week at CES, Toyota, led by Gill Pratt of DARPA fame and now CEO of Toyota Research Institute (TRI), informed the world what Toyota intended to do with it's billion dollar investment in their new AI research facilities in Silicon Valley and Cambridge:\u201cUp to now, our industry has measured on-road reliability of autonomous vehicles, in the millions of miles, which is impressive. But to achieve full autonomy we actually need reliability that is a million times better.  We need trillion-mile reliability. Toyota has traditionally been a hardware company because in the past the most important technology for enhancing human mobility was hardware. Times have changed, and software and data are now essential components of Toyota\u2019s future mobility strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is entirely possible that robots will become for today\u2019s Toyota what the car industry was when Toyota made looms. Home robots may be even more personally prized in our future than cars have been in our past. Toyota\u2019s goal is to move people across the room, across town, and across the country.\u201d\"Our initial technical team directing research will include James Kuffner, CMU professor and former head of Google Robotics, who will be our area lead in cloud computing... [and also six others].\"The portion of Pratt's announcement that James Kuffner had left Google and was joining Toyota - and Pratt - was newsworthy in the robotics world. It showcased the changes in leadership stemming from the abrupt earlier departure from Google of Andy Rubin, the original leader who left after a buying spree that brought 8 robotic startups into Google. James Kuffner became the acting CEO of the Replicant robotics group which recently located within the Google X Lab. Conor Dougherty, in a NY Times article, wrote:Google\u2019s robotics division has been plagued by low morale and a lack of leadership since the unit\u2019s founder left abruptly in 2014. Now Alphabet is cleaning it up. Over the last two months, Alphabet, the new holding company that separated Google from its collection of speculative projects, has reframed the robots effort, moving it from a stand-alone division inside Google to a piece of the X research division. The company has also hired Hans Peter Brondmo, a technology industry veteran who last worked at Nokia, to help with management.X, which is run by Astro Teller, is using some element of robotics in numerous projects like self-driving cars; Project Wing, an effort to deliver packages with drone aircraft; and Makani, an effort to capture wind energy with high-flying kites.Brondmo joins Jonathan Rosenberg, who is a troubleshooter for Larry Page, the Google co-founder who is Alphabet\u2019s chief executive, and Aaron Edsinger, previously the CEO of both Meka and Redwood Robotics, in the day-to-day management of the robotics group.The Rubin Google acquisitions include: Schaft, a Japanese start-up developing a humanoid robot; Industrial Perception, a Silicon Valley start-up that developed a computer vision system for loading and unloading trucks; Meka Robotics, a robot developer for academia; Redwood Robotics, a start-up intended to compete with the Baxter robot (and others) entering the small and medium-sized shop and factory marketplace; Bot & Dolly, a maker of robotic camera systems used for special effects such as in the movie \"Gravity;\" Autofuss, a design and marketing firm and a partner in Bot & Dolly; Holomni, a maker of powered caster modules for omnidirectional vehicles and Boston Dynamics, an engineering company specializing in building robots and software for human simulation.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "From the 2015 archives of The Robot Report: 55 fundings of $1.321 billion, 32 acquisitions totalling over $2.27 billion, 2 failures, and one IPO \u2014 all adding up to some surprisingly large figures. [All citations below can be found in the 2015 archives of The Robot Report.]Large and small -- but steadily throughout the year, all types of funding for robotic startups and spin-offs occurred during 2015.Large fundings:Smaller fundings:2015 fundings are almost triple what they were in 2014, and the number of acquisitions has also grown. UAS, robots, robotics and robotic-like apps are entering our lives and workplaces everyday and everywhere \u2014 and getting funded. Unmanned systems were a big component in this year\u2019s fundings as can be seen in this chart by CBInsights:Looking back to the beginning of the digital era, hobbyists and early adopters dabbled for years but not too much happened until three software applications showed businesses how PCs and software could change the way they worked. Business people became aware mostly by word-of-mouth of the qualities and uses of WordStar, VisiCalc and dBase. Even though none of those three companies still exists, their concepts are ubiquitous in our world today.As robots move from behind fixed and caged locations to take their place alongside us (what the new collaborative robots are doing), and as they move from heavy-duty industrial applications to providing assistance and augmenting skills (what the new surgical systems and low-cost data collecting drones are doing), business people can once again see that rising tide and they want in (or said another way, they don\u2019t want to be left out). Ray Kurzweil said that auto companies don\u2019t want to be \u2018Nokia\u2019d\u2019 \u2014 i.e., they don\u2019t want to be pushed aside as typewriters, secretaries and stand-alone word processors were by WordStar, WordPerfect and MS Word, or Nokia\u2019s operating system was by Google\u2019s Android.This awareness accounts for why companies of all types and sizes are finding strategic reasons to acquire robotic ventures to add to their arsenal of products and services. They don\u2019t want to be left behind like Nokia was. And they are paying high prices for their acquisitions. Many thought the multiples Teradyne paid for Universal Robots were unreasonably high. Others suggested that the growth Universal has shown \u2014 and continues to show \u2014 make it worth every penny.Personally, I see that acquisitions make sense to and for the acquirer; I\u2019m just disappointed that the acquired companies won\u2019t go public (there was only a single IPO in 2015!) so that investors such as myself can share in the fun and ride the wave.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "This article was first published on IEEE Spectrum Automaton and is republished here with permission. For the IEEE version, click here; for the unabridged version, continue reading.Collaborative robots (also called co-bots) are robots designed to assist humans in the performance of their tasks \u2013 i.e., to work jointly on a project. Because co-bots are almost plug and play - and very low-cost - SMEs are buying and the segment is quickly growing.There are many reasons for the emergence of collaborative robots: to handle ergonomically challenging tasks, using them alongside humans in small-spaced electronics assembly lines, using them because they are affordable, using them because they are plug and play and easily trainable, using them for their flexibility to handle short runs, and using them to offload repetitive and boring jobs. Co-bots are also emerging because sensors and computer power have become so cheap that they are driving down the cost of robots and making them more available to businesses of all sizes. Initially driving this movement was the EU SME Robot P-P-P started in Europe in 2005 with a goal of increasing worker productivity so that labor-intensive tasks wouldn\u2019t be off-shored. Recently the movement has been promoted by the launch of the Baxter robot and its developer and chief promoter Rodney Brooks. And by the ease-of-use factor: co-bots are easier to train and deploy than big industrial robots.Most professional service robots are collaborative by design, hence co-bots aren\u2019t just for SMEs or for manufacturing use. Offices, homes, labs, warehouses, farms, distribution centers, hospitals and healthcare facilities are all enabling service robots to help them do their jobs better. The market is open-ended but current uses for co-bots include machine tending, material handling, assembly tasks and packaging. They also pick and place, count and inspect. As more co-bots are deployed, more uses will be discovered.In a human-machine study conducted by an MIT professor at a BMW factory, it was shown that teams made of humans and robots collaborating efficiently can be more productive than teams made of either humans or robots alone. Also, the cooperative process reduced human idle time by 85%.At present, sales of collaborative robots represent 5% of the overall robot market but with strong growth expectations for the future. In fact, the market acceptance of collaborative robots and also drones are expected to be significant drivers in non-industrial robotic growth. This non-industrial growth will be split and different for differing aspects of the service robotics marketplace but as Tractica, a Colorado research firm projects, growth will be significant, exponential, and near-term.The collaborative robotics sector is expected to increase roughly tenfold between 2015 and 2020, reaching over $1 billion from approximately $95M in 2014. Insiders suggest more rapid growth: that collaborative lightweight robots will become the top seller in the industry in about 2 years, selling hundreds of thousands and with prices falling to the $15,000-$20,000 level. TechNavio, a British market research firm, in their September, 2015, $2,500 report, forecasts the global collaborative robots market to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50.88% to 2019.Industrial robots are caged to keep humans safe and out of harm\u2019s way. Service robots are meant to safely leave the cage while doing tasks for humans. Collaborative robots come in all sizes and shapes and have integrated sensors and soft and rounded surfaces for safety purposes and to reduce the risk of impact, pinching and crushing. The biggest safety feature of collaborative robots is their force limited joints which are designed to sense forces due to impact and quickly react.Rethink Robotics, a venture-funded Boston-based robotics firm headed by Rodney Brooks, markets a two-armed industrial robot named Baxter with a base price of $25,000 that can carry out relatively advanced functions such as removing defective items from product lines, packing finished items into boxes and performing basic quality-control inspections. Additional purchase costs include a mobile pedestal ($3,000), gripper ($1,750), and a 2-year hardware and software service contract ($7,000). With an expected useful life of three years, 40 hours of operation per week translates into an average cost of around $4/hour. Though this comes before additional expenses for electricity, maintenance and repair, it remains highly competitive with manufacturing wages in the emerging world.\n\nRethink also sells a narrower one-armed robot named Sawyer with a base price of $29,000 and similar additional costs as Baxter. Sawyer is designed primarily for machine tending, circuit board testing, and other precise, repetitive tasks, specifically those that take place in the middle of a long assembly line of electronics products. There\u2019s a huge need for a robot that can do tasks like these, especially in Asia, and that\u2019s the market Rethink is going after with Sawyer. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into mass electronics manufacturing,\u201d said Brooks in an interview connected with the receipt of a funding round for scaling up sales into China and the promotion of a distribution agreement with Shanghai Electric.Universal Robots, a Danish startup whose one-armed, 6-axis robots have had significant success in the marketplace. At this time they are the market leader producing at an annual run-rate of 5,000+ co-bots. They recently added a third robot to their product line and now have over 200 integrators and distributors around the world and thousands of sold robots at work in SME and larger factories.\n\nAll three of their robots are identical except in size and carry. The UR3, UR5 and UR10 can carry up to 3, 5 and 10 kilograms of load (6.6, 11 and 22 pounds). Pricewise, the UR10 costs $45,000, the UR5 costs $35,000 and the new UR3 is priced at $23,000. The UR3 can handle payloads of up to 3 kg (6.6 lbs), and perform tasks which include: mounting of small objects, gluing, screwing (it can tighten applying the correct torque), operating tools, soldering and painting. It has a reach radius of 500 mm (19.7 in) allowing it to be deployed in tight spaces.Universal has found another and perhaps bigger use of co-bots through their work with automaker BMW, which already has 7,500 industrial robots at work in their factories. BMW has been testing UR robots alongside factory workers who had been tasked with ergonomically challenging assignments. The robots were quickly trained for those tasks and performed perfectly while freeing up the worker to do even more of what he or she was doing. The results of the tests turned out so well that a BMW spokesman, who oversaw the testing, said that it was likely that BMW would soon double or even triple their number of robots by the use of these low-cost, portable, easy-to-program, safe to work alongside robots. [Thus one can easily see why Teradyne paid $350,000,000 for Universal Robots with that kind of endorsement and prospect for the future.]\n\nMRK-Systeme GmbH, a German integrator of industrial robot technology, offers two collaborative software packages which work, at present, with KUKA\u2019s 5SI low-payload robot: SafeGuiding for moving the robot manually to teach it applications, and SafeInteraction which provides five human-robot safety functions to the robot control system. They also integrate Kuka\u2019s robot into their own branded KR 5 SI one-armed robot.\nF&P Personal Robotics, a Swiss spin-off from the University of Zurich, offers a line of co-bots emphasizing safety and functionality. Their robots are context aware, use soft material covers, have limited and controlled force sensors, motor torque is limited by the controller, and their software uses deep learning AI to enable their robots to adapt and improve based on human feedback. F&P recently introduced their new  P-Rob 2, an all-in-one robotic arm, with sensors and software embedded in a PC as control unit in the base of the robot.\nBosch developed the APAS line of co-bots and has deployed 50 of them, mostly for internal operations. Safety is provided by a special sensor skin and software controls. Training is done using a graphic user interface on a teach pendant and the robot can be outfitted with an optional 3D camera system.The Bosch APAS system was the first to be certified as an assistance system, i.e., safe to work alongside with human workers.ABB, one of the Big Four global industrial robot manufacturers, recently launched a two-armed collaborative robot capable of advanced manual tasks. Called YuMi, the robot is able, with a high degree of precision, to handle small parts assembly such as mechanical components for watches, smartphones, tablets, PCs and other consumer electronics. The YuMi is dexterous enough to be able to thread a needle.Early in 2015 ABB acquired gomTec, a startup producing a one-armed co-bot named Roberta. gomTec was a 25-person German company headed by Bernd Gombert, a mechatronics engineer with 100+ patents and who was the head of a DLR project which became KUKA\u2019s LBR iiwa robot (see below). Roberta is a family of 6-axis modular co-bots using custom-made brushless motors and harmonic drives. Safety sensors and joint torque sensors can be optionally added. ABB is in the process of integrating a new intuitive programming user interface and rebranding Roberta to ABB\u2019s brand and expects to launch in Q1 or Q2 of 2016.\n\nBecause ABB is so big and has such an extensive sales, distributor and integrator marketing force, they are expected to quickly penetrate the small parts assembly market with their lineup of plug and play one- and two-armed low-cost co-bots.MABI Robotic is a Swiss manufacturer of industrial robots. Their slick precision Speedy 10 one-armed table-top robot is lightweight, fast, easily trained but unclear as to whether it is safe to work alongside.\n\nFANUC Corp makes CNCs, servo motors, lasers and a full line of industrial robots. Fanuc is the biggest of the Big Four robotic providers. Their CR-35iA is their first collaborative robot and it can carry the heaviest load of all the co-bots so far announced, 77 pounds, and has full safety compliance using soft rubber skin and multiple sensors including either a vision sensor or a 3D area sensor.The CR-35iA is too big for work in a narrow space such as on an electronics assembly line but it\u2019s ability to carry heavy loads opens it up to other tasks better suited for a robot than a human such as inserting a spare tire into a new car\u2019s compartment.\n\nSmokie Robotics, a Tennessee startup, produces a modular one-armed robot configurable for 3 to 7 DoFs. Their OUR-1 robot uses open source architecture enabling easy integration into existing production systems and their OUR-2 robot will be available in Q1 2016.KUKA Robot Group, headquartered in Augsburg, Germany, is one of the global Big Four producers of industrial robots. Their first foray into co-bots is the LBR iiwa (lighweight robot, intelligent industrial work assistant) which comes with the ability to carry 15 or 30 pounds of payload and the Sunrise controller. The robot has 7 joint torque sensors which enables the control system to detect externally applied forces. The robot has the sensitivity of a human and can quickly feed information through the controller to safely control the motions of the robot.The KUKA LBR iiwa fully complies with the industry safety standard ISO 10218 and the new standards for human-robot collaboration ISO 12100 and ISO 13849. Also, the LBR robot has been at work in the Daimler transmission plant since it was first tested in 2009. It has been used in the processing of more than 500,000 transmissions since then. Although the robot is programmed to perform automatically, it approaches objects carefully and adjusts to changed conditions. For example, if a workpiece is not optimally positioned, the robot adjusts its motion sequence accordingly using it\u2019s SafeOperation software to restrict or monitor workspaces and safety zones between machines or between humans and machines.\n\nKUKA, like the other Big Four vendors, has a global marketing capability consisting of sales people, distributors, integrators and resellers. If they can get the selling price down from its present $100k+, they have the ability to become a major player in the SME market \u2013 a significant breakthrough expanding KUKA\u2019s products into that arena.\n\nKawada Industries makes the Nextage two-armed industrial robot. Safety is handled by the stereo vision cameras in the head and by using low-power motors and elbow controls so that don\u2019t jut outwards even when both arms are in operation. Over 150 of the $60,000 robots have been sold and are at work in factories in Japan, according to Discuss Japan in a May, 2015 report.As robots move from behind fixed and caged locations to alongside us - as they move from heavy-duty industrial applications to providing assistance and augmenting skills - and as the metrics of robot ownership and deployment change and become more affordable, business people can see that rising tide of change and they want in (or said another way, they don't want to be left out). Thus companies of all types and sizes are finding strategic reasons to acquire or invest in robotics and robotic ventures to add to their arsenal of products and services. They don't want to be left.Universal Robots has a big head start. 2016 will likely see them continue to lead but KUKA, ABB and FANUC will begin to make inroads and experiment with different prices. By the beginning of 2017, the competition will become even more intense as the number of co-bots sold approaches 15,000 units - $0.5 billion in sales revenue. It\u2019s still too early in the evolution of co-bots for provider consolidation, but some systems are sure to be preferred because of their flexibility, ease of training and support base.The SME marketplace is huge \u2013 6 million companies worldwide and almost 70% of the world\u2019s manufacturing. A few low-cost plug and play robotic tools can easily fit into the manufacturing process in most of these companies which is why it is easy to imagine that co-bots could be on track to sell hundreds of thousands of units beginning as early as 2018. \u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

The funding is to localize apps and gestures and enable Jibo to speak Japanese and Chinese so that it can be sold to those markets.\u201cWe\u2019ve received significant interest from Asia. I just got back from Japan and there\u2019s a different kind of interest in that market for robots. In the US, it\u2019s more about what can this robot do for me. But in Japan, there\u2019s almost a folk lore to robots,\u201d said Jibo CEO Steve Chambers.Aaron Tilley on the Forbes staff wrote: \"Jibo has a robot head that swivels on a static base in a cartoon-like manner. Users can talk to Jibo, and it will talk back. Jibo can also take pictures or play games. The robot\u2019s camera recognizes users and remembers their preferences. The company is integrating Jibo with a bunch of third-party services to open up what the robot can do. A Skype integration, for instance, would allow the user to take calls on the robot and then have the robot\u2019s camera follow them as they move around. Some companies are interested in integrating Jibo with other smart home devices. The company is also now working on these third-party integrations with Internet services in China and Japan.Blue River Technology, a Silicon Valley startup, has perfected its lettuce-thinning technology and is now providing that service to 10% of the growers in the industry. This new round of funding is to expand their technologies to be able to sense each individual plant, determine its health and needs and then precisely apply the correct amount of care, plant by plant, at tractor speed, the very definition of precision agriculture.Blue River uses computer vision and robotics for various agricultural tasks. It was founded in 2011 by two Stanford University alumni, and has made breakthrough algorithms and robotic solutions for identifying weeds and selectively killing unwanted plants. Its solution is particularly suited to organic agriculture and for fields with chemical-resistant weeds.Osaro, a San Francisco startup, received $3.3 million in seed funding to accelerate the development of AI for robots to speed up the training and programming process.Soft Robotics Inc., a Boston startup, received $3 million in Series A funding from Material Impact Fund, Taylor Farms Ventures and Haiyin Capital. The funds will be used to enable rapid growth and widespread deployment of their unique gripper system for advanced manufacturing and food handling and the ag industry not only in the U.S. but in China as well.Na\u00efo Technologies, a French startup with its first sales in 2015, raised $3.3 million from the Emertec and CapAgro investment funds, a WiSeed crowdfunding campaign and via its previous shareholders. The newly obtained funds will allow the company to finance international expansion, R&D activities and to double sales in 2016.Flyability, a Swiss drone startup, raised $2.53 million. \u201cThis round brings Flyability the resources needed to launch its first product to market, which will be available in 2016\u201d, said Patrick The\u0301voz, co-founder and CEO of the company. The company has already shipped prototypes to its first customers focusing on industrial inspection in the energy and transport infrastructure industries, and first responders such as firefighters, police forces, and search & rescue professionals.Kurion, a California integrator of service robots for high-risk applications, acquired Oxford Technologies, a 60-employee UK and EU provider of robotic services for nuclear facilities and clean rooms, for an undisclosed amount.BOTTOM LINE: Money continues to flow to robotic ventures well into the holiday season. Over $1.2 billion has been invested in more than 50 robotic startup companies, and an amount well above that figure has been involved in 29 acquisitions.

      "content": "I'm saddened to report that Joseph Engelberger, 90, the robot pioneer who helped invent the first American industrial robot, and a man that had a significant impact on my interest in robotics, passed away.In 2003, BusinessWeek interviewed Engelberger. The article was entitled \"How Robots Lost Their Way.\" Included in the story was a plea for money to build an eldercare robot that Engelberger thought could be built with then-current technologies, rented for $600 per month, operated at a cost of $1.25 per hour (compared to healthcare homeworkers who cost around $15 per hour) and developed at a cost of less than $700,000.\"The robot I'm working on will be two-armed, mobile, sensate, and articulate. It doesn't need to communicate a great deal to meet the needs of an 85-year-old. A human can ask: 'What's for lunch?' and the robot can respond with what it's able to make, or it can say: 'We're going to Johnny's,' or 'We just had lunch.' The voice recognition, behavioral systems, and artificial intelligence necessary to do this are ready. Most of the other technologies are, too. We don't need more navigation development\u2014getting around an apartment is easier than moving through a hospital or on Mars, which robots do now. I could prove this functionality with the right partner for about $700,000 in 14 months or less.\"A few years after reading the BusinessWeek story, I tracked down Engelberger and phoned him. We had several long conversations on the subject. He was a fun character to talk with, and I learned much in the process. But when we got to the part where I offered him the money he needed, he said,\"No. I don't want your money. You're just an investor. I want money and partnerships with Panasonic, or Johnson & Johnson, Philips, or Siemens. They're in the business [healthcare products], have deep pockets, and have what I need for the robot to be successful: 1. design and manufacturing capability and 2. marketing experience in the health and eldercare marketplace.\"He wanted strategic partnerships with companies that had already penetrated the marketing chain, had manufacturing experience regarding healthcare devices AND the deep pockets for the long haul of bringing the product to market and then supporting it and growing the product line.That was in 2006. After all this time, Engelberger's eldercare vision is still a work in progress in research labs and startup companies around the world. Products are emerging but very slowly and their solutions are not as broad-based and flexible as Joe imagined. Most are single-purposed and not for home use; and none are produced by the companies Engelberger mentioned. Panasonic has a line of robotic hospital devices; Johnson & Johnson discontinued their iBot stair-climbing wheelchair; and Honda and Toyota showcase their walking research robots but don't have any healthcare robots available for purchase.I learned a lot from my conversations with Joe. I shared his passion for the utility of the product (and not the process of developing it) and for his understanding of the value of strategic partners versus investors. He made a lot of sense to me and helped guide me in my interest in robotics. I'm very grateful... and saddened that he died.If you would like to learn more about Joe, the Robotic Industries Association has posted an obituary here.____________Portions of this article were excerpted from an article I wrote which appeared in 2012 in IEEE Spectrum.Photo from BusinessWeek magazine, 2003.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

Blue Belt has been working on, and plans to launch in 2017, a total knee system, and has hip arthroplasty in its pipeline. Medrobotics, the Raynham, MA developer of the Flex Robotic System, a snake-like \u0003minimally invasive system to reach into locations that were \u0003previously difficult to reach, closed a $25 million preferred stock financing package with existing shareholders. Proceeds will be used to expand the commercialization process of the Flex Robot System which received FDA approval in July.Aeryon Labs, a Canadian military and first responder drone and vision systems maker, secured $45.9 million from Boston-based Summit Partners. \"In the last four years, we have grown 100 percent year-over-year in terms of sales and we've been profitable too, and we now expect that to move into the 200 percent sales growth range over the next couple of years,\" said Aeryon's Chief Executive Dave Kroetsch in an interview. \"The cash infusion from Summit Partners will not only help the firm boost sales, but also more than double its headcount to about 200 people, most of whom will be based in and around its headquarters in Waterloo.\"SkySpecs, an Ann Arbor, Michigan startup integrating an automated, drone-based data collection, vision, and analytics service for wind turbine and infrastructure inspection, received $3 million in equity funding. SkySpecs also received an FAA waiver to fly its drones commercially and landed its first two wind turbine inspection customers.Righthand Robotics, a Cambridge, MA stealthy startup and developer of a 3-fingered dexterous gripper, raised $3.3 million from angel investors and VCs to continue developing their intelligent robotic order-picking system. RightHand's technology, with flexible grasping and fingertip barometric and tactile sensors, enables items which can be grasped by \"feel\".Jibo, the social intelligent humanoid, received additional funding of an undisclosed amount from Fenox Venture Capital, a Silicon Valley-based VC firm. Fenox has arranged partnerships with SEGA SAMMY Holdings and CAC Holdings to help Jibo expand its sales and marketing in Japan and throughout the Asian marketplace.CyPhy Works, a Danvers, MA startup headed by ex-iRobot co-founder and President Helen Greiner, received $22 million after raising an additional $900K from a Kickstarter campaign. CyPhy's tether technology enable its drones to stay aloft indefinitely, stream what it sees in high definition, and have its communications be secure and unjammable thereby valuable to defense, security, police, fire fighters and search operators.Petnet, the manufacturer of a smart feeder for cats and dogs, raised $4 million from Amazon, iRobot and Black River, to expand and build out its digital supply chain strategy for pet owners.MiR Mobile Industrial Robots received $1.436 million from five Danish investors after turning down offers from American, Chinese and EU VCs. The Danish startup of a mobile robotic platform for logistics chose five Danish investors who are investing their own money in MiR. This is a similar financing path that Universal Robots took and UR's CTO Esben \u00d8stergaard is one of those investors. \u201cAfter having been in dialog with a number of large and interesting investors, who each, of course, had their own agendas and wishes for strong influence, I stopped and thought: What is really important to a growth business? To be in control yourself and have freedom to act fast and in time! Consequently, I explored the possibilities among the existing owners, the board of directors and the network around MiR, and here a picture quickly emerged of an obvious, strong team of dedicated Danish investors. As I see it, we now have the required growth capital as well as the right competencies among the board members and owners in relation to where MiR is now,\u201d says Thomas Visti, CEO.Bionik Labs, a Canadian medical robotics startup company that develops exoskeleton solutions for people with restricted physical mobility, sold $6.2 million in stock and warrants (in February, 2015) in a private placement.Corepath Robotics, a Danish startup using new-tech training methods to teach welding, milling and plasma cutting robots how to flexibly handle low-volume tasks, received $355K from two Danish VC funds.ConMed, a New York state medical tech provider of surgical devices for minimally invasive procedures, acquired SurgiQuest for $265 million. SurgiQuest's AirSeal system enables access for robotics and laparoscopy procedures and has been used in more than 250K procedures in over 45 countries. Kraken Sonar, a Newfoundland startup, acquired the unmanned marine assets and intellectual property of Marine Robotics, Inc.\"We believe that the ocean drone market is at an inflection point and set for major growth,\" said Karl Kenny, President and CEO of Kraken. \"This acquisition brings us a significant underwater technology and IP portfolio and continues to build on our sensors-to-systems strategy to be a market leader in the Unmanned Maritime Systems industry.\"Included in the assets acquired are underwater robotics technology, IP and related physical assets -- including an operational SQX-500 Unmanned Underwater Vehicle. In addition, the majority of the senior electrical, mechanical and software engineers that were previously employed by Marine Robotics Inc. are now Kraken employees.Smith & Nephew, a global medical tech conglomerate that is expanding into robotics-assisted surgeries, announced that they are paying $275 million to acquire Pittsburgh startup Blue Belt Technologies. Blue Belt has developed a robotic-assisted surgical system for knee replacement. Smith & Nephew is already Blue Belt's sales partner and distributor.Shenzhen DJI Innovations, the maker of the very successful line of DJI drones, has purchased a minority state in Hasselblad, the Swedish-based camera firm, for an undisclosed amount. Frank Wang, DJI founder and CEO, said the two companies \u201cshare a passion to provide creative people with cutting-edge, inventive technology to help them take visual storytelling to the next level.

Stryker's $1.65 billion acquisition of MAKO Surgical in September, 2013 is an example.UPDATED 12-2-2015: Fixes incorrect information about Auris Robotic Systems (see below).Smith & Nephew, a global medical tech conglomerate that is expanding into robotics-assisted surgeries, announced that they are paying $275 million to acquire Pittsburgh startup Blue Belt Technologies. Blue Belt has developed a robotic-assisted surgical system for knee replacement. Smith & Nephew is already Blue Belt's sales partner and distributor. Blue Belt has been working on, and plans to launch in 2017, a total knee system, and has hip arthroplasty in its pipeline.Olivier Bohuon, Chief Executive Officer of Smith & Nephew said, \u201cThis acquisition is a compelling strategic move, with the combination of complementary products and R&D programs creating a platform from which we can shape this exciting new area of surgery. It reinforces our distinctive orthopaedic reconstruction strategy, which combines cutting edge innovation, disruptive business models and a strong emerging markets platform to drive outperformance.\u201dThe surgical robot device market was estimated to be $3.2 billion in 2014 and forecast to reach $20 billion by 2021 as next generation devices, systems and instruments are introduced to manage surgery through small ports in the body instead of large open wounds. The market is characterized by enormous variety and innovation from snake robots to navigation systems to highly articulated devices such as the da Vinci surgical system from Intuitive Surgical. This dynamic growth industry will involve many shifts in ownership and funding, suggests RNR Market Research in their 553 page, $4,000 report published in April.Auris Medical Robotics, the Peter Thiel backed startup developing an eye surgery robotic device, received $150 million from undisclosed sources, MedCity News reported from an analysis of regulartory filings. Just last year, Auris raised a $34 million from some 20 backers, including Highland Capital Partners, Lux Capital and Mithril Capital Management. It was previously - and incorrectly reported - that Auris had been acquired for $150 million.In addition to Stryker's $1.5 billion acquisition of MAKO, many other robotic medical device startups have been acquired including Hansen Medical which acquired the rights to Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics and also acquired EndoVia Medical and AorTx; Intuitive Surgical acquired licenses from Power Medical Interventions; and TransEnterix Surgical acquired the TELELAP ALF-X project for $100 million.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Amazon announced that at the end of September they had 30,000 Kiva robots at work in 13 fulfillment centers. \"Our intent is to use [Kiva robots and the Amazon Robotics subsidiary] more widely, so stay tuned.\"UPDATED 11-1-2015: Added Grenzebach's G-Com storage and picking system to the list of vendors offering competing systems to Kiva's.Phil Hardin, Amazon's director of investor releations also said:\"The wider use of robots at fulfillment centers has had a direct impact on productivity. It\u2019s a bit of an investment that has implications for a lot of elements of our cost structure, but we\u2019re happy with Kiva. It has been a great innovation for us, and we think it makes the warehouse jobs better, and we think it makes our warehouses more productive.\u201dAmazon acquired Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012 and recently renamed it Amazon Robotics. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon. This left a big gap in the marketplace for robotic innovation in distribution and fulfillment centers because Kiva's goods-to-man technology was taken inhouse by Amazon.Distribution centers are principle parts of the order processing and fulfillment process. [Distribution centers can also be called warehouses, DCs, fulfillment centers and package handling centers.] As the e-commerce boom continues to grow, warehouse managers need to find new suppliers to meet their automation needs for their DCs. Amazon is just one of many online e-commerce providers in need of robots and automation in their DCs. Alibaba and Jingdong in China and Flipkart and Snapdeal in India are also big e-commerce companies adding robots to their warehouses.eCommerce is the fastest growing segment of retail. In 2013 it represented less than 10% of overall retail but has been growing at nearly 15% annually and is expected to continue at that rate for the remainder of the decade. Online retailers are having to change their operations to meet this growing demand.A few startups are beginning to enter the market to fill the gap left by Kiva:  \u200bIn addition to the startups mentioned above, old-line companies are also entering the market. The 55-year old Germany-headquartered Grenzebach Group is a good example. Grenzebach has held interests in KUKA, Inos Automation, SnoxStellar AGVs, and Swisslog -  all involved in robotics, vision systems and materials handling and all involved in their new G-Com mobile storage and picking system. Grenzebach is still the controlling partner in all but KUKA and Swisslog. [KUKA bought back it's shares from Grenzebach and acquired Swisslog for $357 million in September, 2014.] BLG Logistics was awarded the German Logistics Award 2015 for an installation in the warehouse of a trading company of 74 Grenzebach G-Com robots delivering goods from 800 shelves to 5 picking stations.Bottom line: Amazon isn't the only e-commerce warehouse operator adding robots to their automation arsenal. Think Coca Cola, Walmart, Nike, Ikea, FedEx, UPS and Diapers. And there are hundreds of name-brand suppliers of warehousing automation technology such as Westfalia, Egemin, Schaefer, Swisslog, Vanderlande, Daifuku, Intelligrated, JBT, Knapp and Thiele to name just a few. There is a transition in technology to reduce fixed racking and conveyor costs in favor of dynamic storage and mobility methods. Thus far only Kiva and these new startups are offering that level of disruptive system but the big companies are sure to enter the fray soon with competing products.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "We have reported 37 equity fundings and 25 acquisitions so far this year. It's not just the car companies searching for talent and innovation in their new Silicon Valley centers. Israel, Russia, China and big companies like Bosch, SoftBank, Apple and Google are all investing in robotics for various strategic reasons. Many new robotics companies have been acquired this year and even more have been funded. Drone makers 3D Robotics, DJI Innovations and Yuneec Aviation all received massive amounts of equity funding ($50M, $75M and $60M respectively). But even more money was invested by acquisitions. Adept Technologies was acquired by Japanese OMRON Industrial Automation for $200M, Universal Robots by Teradyne for $350M, VGo by Vecna for an undisclosed amount, Segway by Chinese Ninebot and gomTec by ABB. The rationale behind each purchase was strategic as was the $600M joint venture supporting the roll-out of the Pepper robot in Japan and China by SoftBank, Alibaba and Foxconn. Additionally, three R&D ventures stand out as particularly far-reaching and interesting:A new Sino-Israeli Robotics Institute is being developed as the centerpiece of a $2 billion industrial park in the Guangzhou region of China. It will house entities built around the technology developed jointly by Israeli and Chinese researchers at the new institute. \u201cChina is a major opportunity for us, and manufacturers there are very motivated to take advantage of our technology. There are many factories that will be interested in the technology developed at the Institute\u201d said Zvi Shiller, chairman of the Israel Robotics Association.\nEarlier this year there was another Chinese joint venture with the Russians. The Skolkovo Foundation and Chinese Cybernaut Investment Group inked a deal to establish an R&D business incubator at the Skolkovo Innovation Center in the outskirts of Moscow where it will house at least 15 startups into IT and robotics, space, energy-efficiency tech and new materials which will be developed and marketed in and from China.\n _____*  I visited two Bosch startups in the Renningen area last year as their new campus was under construction. Wholly-owned by Bosch but entrepreneurial startups dotted the office landscape all over the area. The new campus, and Bosch's encouragement of interdisciplinary collaboration, were sorely needed and show Bosch's goal of staying one step ahead of technological breakthroughs while adding some of the benefits of a unique community environment.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "The service robotics industry is relatively new, diverse, and picking up steam daily. Service robotics covers every robotic activity except those described as industrial. They are robots that perform useful tasks for humans and are categorized as either personal or professional.Service robots cross definitional borders. They collaborate safely with humans and they move goods of all types for all types of purposes. Mobile robots fly, swim, run, jump, clean and glide. They milk. They help. They assist in factories, shops, homes and hospitals. One significant difference between industrial robots and service robotics is that for the latter, there is no multiplier for additional costs associated with getting the robot up and operating in a safe fixed location. Service robots, particularly service robots for personal and private use, tend to be self-contained and/or plug and play and not in need of integration services as is the case with industrial robots.The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) just published their World Robotics Service Robots statistical review of 2014 (with projections through 2018). The 316-page $675 report details the sales revenue and units sold by category from a database of approximately 300 service robot manufacturers around the globe.Revenue from the sale of industrial robots was $10.7 billion and an additional $21.3 billion for supporting services such as integration, peripherals, software and systems engineering -- $32 billion in total. Service robotics (both professional and private) totaled $5.97 billion. Therefore, the combined value of the robotics industry, service, support and industrial for 2014 was $38 billion.There are many, many variables that could seriously alter these projections. The IFR acknowledges this problem as follows:The 4 year projections are conservative due to the character of the company feed-back. Typically companies only report projections of sales of existing products (or at least pre-series products that are about to be launched). Therefore a future product, Jibo for example, is not reported and counted.Nevertheless, the projections are very likely to be seriously understated for a variety of possible reasons:[The IFR produced their report and based their projections on a limited database of 300 service robot companies of which 15% were startups. The Robot Report's database contains over 900 service robot companies and an additional 400 service startups. The IFR's database is distributed 23% from Asia, 36% from the US and Canada, and 41% from the UK, EU and elsewhere. The Robot Report's database is quite similarly distributed for service companies but it differs significantly in where the startups are located: only 12% in Asia,  48% in the US and Canada, and 40% in the UK, EU, Israel and elsewhere.]\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "August and September equity fundings, joint ventures, acquisitions and venture funds continue the momentum exhibited throughout 2015 of serious money flowing into robotics startups. For a list of acquisitions, click here.GE Ventures has become a strategic investor in Clearpath Robotics for an undisclosed sum. This follows a March, 2015 $11.5 Series A funding round for Clearpath. GE invested after three years of collaboration on the development of Clearpath\u2019s new OTTO heavy load mobility platform which was displayed last week at RoboBusiness. GE is also the first purchaser of the OTTO.\nDronomy, an Israili drone technology startup, got $1.5M to continue the development of collision avoidance software. The Dronomy team and it's VC investors have ties to the Israeli air force.\nIntel Capital invested $60M in Hong Kong drone startup Yuneec Electric Aviation last month. Intel and Yuneec will work on developing future products. Yuneec makes drones for consumers and industrial users, as well as manned electric aircraft. Intel has invested in other drone companies such as Airware and PrecisionHawk. These drone relationships fit with Intel\u2019s strategy to make investments in companies developing products with the potential to expand the market for semiconductors, as the company searches for new devices for chips. Qualcomm is doing the same kind of strategic investments for their chip development.\nVirtual Incision, a Nebraska-based startup developing minimally-invasive mini-robot surgical devices for colon resection and other abdominal procedures, received $11.2M in venture funding. The funding will be used for feasibility studies on the use of the company\u2019s surgical technology for colon resection, inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.Jibo, Inc., the social robot which last year had the successful $3.7 million Indiegogo crowd funding, recently got an $11M add-on to the previous $25.3M A round to concentrate on the Asian market. With this $11M, Jibo has now raised $38.6M and expects to begin shipping crowdfund and preorders in December, 2015.HUVR Data Services, one of the many new companies using robotic technology to provide that technology as a service to clients, gets $2M in Series A funding. HUVR uses drones to inspect industrial and agricultural assets and provides data analytics to their clients.Peloton Technology, a Silicon Valley startup providing truck platooning technology, got $17 million from some strategic investors after receiving $16M just a few months earlier in April. Denso Intl. was the lead investor in both funding rounds. Denso is a Japanese robot maker that also provides technology and components to the global auto industry.GreyOrange, an India and Singapore-based materials handling startup, received $30 million in equity funding to ramp up production of their Butler shelves-to-picker robot system. GreyOrange currently has 300+ employees which it plans to double with this new funding.Midea Group, a large Chinese home appliance maker, formed two joint ventures with Yaskawa Electric. Yaskawa is one of the worldwide Big Four manufacturers of industrial robots. Midea and Yaskawa wil invest a total of $65M in two new as-yet unnamed ventures. One will be focused on service robots. Midea will own 60% of this venture. The other will focus on industrial robots and Yaskawa will own 51%. Both new ventures will be based in Guangdong, China and will be responsible for research, manufacturing and marketing. Midea hopes its expansion into the robot industry will help upgrade its own manufacturing and industrial automation. It also hopes that Yaskawa\u2019s technologies and products in service robots will help Midea find new business opportunities as China addresses the economic impact of a huge aging population in the coming years.GE Ventures, which has been activly investing in robotics startups (including the one to Clearpath Robotics described above), created a new $20M fund with Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) National Robotics Engineering Center. The new fund, The Robotics Hub AKA Coal Hill Ventures, will begin writing checks early in 2016 for anywhere between $200,000 and $2 million for 20 to 30 emerging robotics startup companies that will be part of The Robotics Hub.The strategy that\u2019s most important to GE is to really get behind startups and help them scale. A lot of companies can come with the money, but what we bring is the ability to scale and the opportunity to commercialize quite quickly.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "At last week's RoboBusiness Conference and Expo in San Jose, there was much gossip, discussion and head scratching regarding the two most recent acquisitions of robot companies: Adept Technologies by Omron and Universal Robots by Teradyne.Everyone asked why. Many questioned the business sense of the deals. And others asked why there were so many acquisitions compared to other methods of funding like IPOs or equity investments. As can be seen from the following pages of The Robot Report, there has been a significant increase in the number of acquisitions this year.Here are the most recent 10 acquisitions:The Adept Technologies sale to Omron Industrial Automation wasn't a suprise - the company had been on a losing streak and the board had placed a salvage artist as the CEO - but the amount, $200 million, was. The all cash deal represented a 63% premium over Adept's stock market capitalization the day before the announcement. OMRON, a Kyoto-based global component manufacturer and robotics integrator employs over 39,000 people in 110 countries and has annual revenues of $7.3 billion of which $2.7B was from their industrial automation group. Interestingly and largely unnoticed was the acquisition by Omron a few months earlier of Delta Tau, a motion controller component manufacturer, for an undisclosed sum. An OMRON spokesman said of the two acquisitions, \"These acquisitions are part of our strategy to enhance our automation technology and position us for long term growth. Robotics will elevate our offerings of advanced automation.\u201d\nIn a surprise move in May, 2015, privately held Danish company Universal Robots - the successful producer of the UR line of collaborative robots - sold to Massachusetts-based Teradyne, a provider of electronic testing equipment for $350 million. Universal has had rapid growth since their startup in 2005. Their first products were sold in 2009, their 2014 sales of $38M were 70% greater than 2013 and they have grown their distributor network to over 200 worldwide. Teradyne, a publicly-traded supplier of test equipment with over 3,900 employees and a product line which doesn't include anything robotic, has a market value of $4.37 billion. Teradyne uses robots in their manufacturing process and their customers are good prospects for Universal's robots. A spokesman said of the transaction, \"This acquisition complements our System and Wireless Test businesses while adding a powerful, additional growth platform to Teradyne.\u201d\nJust the other day it was announced that Fred Moll, the entrepreneur behind Intuitive Surgical, Hansen Medical and Origin Medsystems, received $149.5 million in equity funding for his stealthy startup Auris Surgical Robotics. Auris, founded in 2011, with $184.1M in funding since then, described itself as a venture-funded company developing a robotic microsurgical system designed specifically for opthalmic surgery. The company says they are deep in stealth mode with no comment about the funding or how it will be used.\nEarlier this year TransEnterix Surgical, a medical devices company, raised $50M from an IPO and market switch. This week TransEnterix acquired the surgical robotics division of SOFAR Spa, an Italian healthcare and pharma company, for $99.8M. The division acquired has spearheaded the TELELAP ALF-X project (Advanced Laparoscopy through Force Reflection) since 2002. SOFAR received $25M in cash and 15.5M shares of TransEnterix stock; the agreement also provides for $31.1M in cash to be paid in 3 waves based on negotiated milestones.\nOmnicell, a supplier of automation and business analytics software for patient-centric medication and supply management, acquired Florida-based MTS Medication Technologies for $156 million. MTS is developing a pharmacy robot which kits and packages a persons multi-dose daily pills.\nA month earlier Omnicell acquired MACH4 Pharma Systems, a German company, for an undisclosed amount . MACH4 provides modular robotic solutions for dispensing medications in original manufacturers\u2019 packages.RobotShop, the Montreal-based online robot and robot parts reseller, acquired Let's Make Robots, a robot makers and enthusiasts website and community, for an undisclosed amount.Hypertherm, a welding and laser cutting company, acquired Jabez Technologies, a Canadian software provider for an undisclosed amount. Jabez makes Robotmaster CAD/CAM software which integrates off-line programming, simulation and code generation for robots, and delivering quick robot programs.\u200bDMY Capital, an Australian penny stock company, acquired FastBrick Robotics, an Australian startup which has a new robotic system to lay bricks, for $2.25M plus a bonus of $7M if and when FastBrick is able to brick the walls of a house within 3 days. FastBrick has invented a unique navigation and stabilization system that allows for accurate and fast robotic manipulation over very large areas to within 0.5mm accuracy in all axes regardless of dynamic interferences.Lauren International, a consortium of small manufacturing companies, bought Theiss Aviation, a provider of UAVs to US DoD, NASA and other defense organizations, for an undisclosed amount and renamed it to Theiss UAV Solutions. This is Lauren's first purchase into robotics. A Lauren spokesman said, \u201cTheiss UAV solutions wants to bridge the gap between people who fly and businesses that need aerial data collection, enabling businesses to use UAV technology and cultivate a healthy relationship with the FAA.\u201dWe appear to be on the rising curve of a robot renaissance. There is almost continuous media attention; 2015 fundings are already double all of 2014; and the number of acquisitions has also doubled. Robots, robotics and robotic-like apps are entering our lives and workplaces everyday and everywhere.Looking back at the beginning of the digital era, hobbyists and early adopters dabbled for years but not too much happened until three applications showed businesses how PCs and software applications could change the way they worked and make them more productive. As business people became aware of the qualities and uses of WordStar, VisiCalc and dBase, they turned the curve upward exponentially and even though none of those three companies still exists, their concepts are ubiquitous in our world today.As robot moves from behind fixed and caged locations to alongside us - as the new collaborative robots are doing; as they move from heavy-duty industrial applications to providing assistance or augmenting skills - as the new surgical systems and low-cost data collecting drones are doing; as they move from sci-fi movies and toys to real-life cognizant and communicating assistants, business people once again can see that rising tide and they want in (or said another way, they don't want to be left out). Ray Kurzweil said that auto companies don't want to be Nokia'd, i.e., they don't want to be pushed aside as typewriters were by WordStar, WordPerfect and MS Word, or Nokia's operating system was by Google's Android.Thus companies of all types and sizes are finding strategic reasons to acquire robotic ventures to add to their arsenal of products and services. They don't want to be left behind, to be Nokia'd. And they are paying high prices for their acquisitions. Many thought the multiples Teradyne paid for Universal Robots were unreasonably high. Others suggested that the growth Universal has shown - and continues to show - are worth every penny.To me, I see that acquisitions make sense to and for the acquirer; I'm just disappointed that the acquired company won't go public so that investors such as myself can share in the fun and ride the wave.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "In less than 10 years the volume of our business computing will change from transaction processing to cognition processing. So said IBM's Robert High in his keynote talk at RoboBusiness.This is an important enough trend to stimulate IBM to put over $1 billion into their Watson group - a group working on healthcare, legal and other industry segments that can benefit from the same cognition processing technology which enabled Watson to win at Jeopardy. And it's an important enough trend effecting the human-machine interaction space that it is noteworthy in relation to the RoboBusiness conference.High, CTO of IBM's Watson Group, described the emerging era of embodied cognitive computing leading to providing cognition as a service, as a 3rd hand such as a lab technician might need, or as a concierge as Jibo and Echo (and human concierges) offer, as an office assistant might provide and in field settings like search and rescue. The cognition process involves machines interacting with humans in writing, verbally, with tactal and visual cues and with gestures.In another talk ABI Research's Dan Kara described how technology is transitioning to have constant connection to the Internet of Things (IoT) - from self-describing tags telling robots what they are - thereby supporting the robots perception and manipulation processes - to robots acting as gateways for all the IoT devices that might need to communicate with the robot and perhaps each other, to the ultimate situation of everything being ubiquitously connected to everything.10 winners of Robot Launch 2015 were announced - details can be found here - with the Grand Winner being CleverPet, a stylish consumer device responding to the needs of pets and their owners. \u201cThere were winning startups in every category,\u201d said competition organizer Andra Keay. \u201cEvery investor could find something to interest them, from cloud based simulations and new sensing technologies to eldercare, rehabilitative and social robotics.\u201dIn the exposition hall - with over 70 exhibitors - one could see the first public appearance of the new Sawyer robot from Rethink Robotics performing a machine-tending application. Across the aisle was Softbank and Aldebaran's Pepper robot high-fiving and smiling at passers by. These were just a few of the highlights of day one of RoboBusiness, an annual business-focused robotics conference and trade show produced by EH Publishing.Tomorrow's keynote presentations include Ray Kurzweil talking about the coming merger of robots and biology.More to follow.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Intel Capital invested $60M in Chinese drone startup Yuneek last month. At this week's InterDrone conference and expo, one can readily see why: lots of interest, lots of people, and products that are becoming commodities.Intel and Yuneec will work on developing future products. Yuneec makes drones for consumers and industrial users, as well as manned electric aircraft. Intel has also invested in drone companies Airware and PrecisionHawk. These drone relationships fit with Intel\u2019s strategy to make investments in companies developing products with the potential to expand the market for semiconductors, as the company searches for new devices for chips.Hong Kong-based Yuneek Electric Aviation is one of the Big 3 of drone manufacturers exhibiting at this week's InterDrone International Conference & Exposition in Las Vegas. The other two being SZ DJI Innovations and 3D Robotics. Yuneek and DJI are Chinese companies; 3D Robotics is San Diego based. DJI recently received $75M from Silicon Valley VC Accel Partners. 3D Robotics got $64M so far this year. A study of the 700+ FAA exemptions for commercial drone use shows that the overwhelming majority of them are for companies using DJI quadcopters.Sixty million dollars for Yuneek, $75M to DJI and $64 to 3D Robotics add up to a lot of money and interest. That interest was apparent at the InterDrone event at the Rio Convention Center in Las Vegas. It was the first such event for InterDrone yet from my walk around the show and attendance at a few of the packed conference sessions, it seemed to be successful. 99 exhibitors and over 3,000 visitors. I heard the latter group asking very cogent questions about the ways drones, their capabilities and their data and mapping software could be used for their applications. The crowd appeared to have a high number of foreign visitors as could be seen from the on-site pin-board map at the right.Another observation from the show was the number of secondary exhibitors: GoPro and GoPro accessories, makers of carrying cases, lenses, sensors, mapping software, retail stores carrying multiple lines of drones, cameras and cases. Samy's Camera, a large West Coast camera and printer provider, was showing off the fact that they've been selling all brands of drones for photographic purposes for years.BOTTOM LINE: The commercial drone industry is maturing similar to the way industrial robots matured: a few major manufacturers providing their arms (drones) to thousands of integrators, resellers and value-added service providers which extend the sales reach of the drone (robot) manufacturers.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "In two simultaneous launches last week, Toyota Motor and the UK RAS Group backed their previous statements regarding the imperative for robotics and AI development with money, roadmaps and strategic alliances. Toyota Motor announced an alliance with the AI labs at MIT and Stanford, along with a $50M investment, to develop auto-related sensing and perception, navigation and human-centric learning systems, automated decision making, and human-machine interaction technologies. Gil Pratt, who recently headed the DARPA Robotics Challenge, will lead Toyota's efforts from a new facility in Silicon Valley.At a press conference, the Toyota spokesman repeatedly said that Toyota wasn't going to use this new collaboration to develop self-driving cars; rather, they were planning on augmenting drivers with driver assistance technologies to enhance the commuting experience and reduce highway deaths and injuries.Toyota joins Ford, Mercedes, BMW, Tesla, Honda, Bosch and many other auto companies with AI labs in Silicon Valley and they join more generic AI research by Google, Apple, Baidu and others in the area. Lots of competing methods and an even greater competition for talent.Also announced last week was the establishment and funding of the Northern Robotics Network, a subset of the UK RAS 2020 Robotics and Autonomous Systems Initiative. The new Northern Robotics Network is setting up and funding GAMMA (Growing Autonomous Mission Management Applications), a 3-year, $13.6 million investment by the governments in the Northern regions of the UK to stimulate fast growth and assist with the funding, development and incubation of new ventures in AI and robotics.The UK Government in 2012 identified 8 Great Technologies that support the UK Industrial Strategy to stimulate the UK economy and create jobs and economic growth -- one of which covers robotics and autonomous systems. The government then created the RAS-SIG (Robotics and Autonomous Systems Special Interest Group) which developed a strategic roadmap to achieve their goals, and are now beginning to unfold and fund their various strategies. The Northern Robotics Network is one of those pieces of the overall strategy.The UK is also participating in the European Commission's robotics research and innovation program - a plan to invest $2.8 billion over the next 7 years. The EU Commission itself is investing $850M, and the rest is coming from participating governments and corporations. The goal is to invest in every robotics sector, from industrial robots to domestic, from the fields to space, etc.Japan has a 5-year robotic strategy (Robot Revolution Initiative (RRI)), a group of 200 companies, universities and governmental agencies, to challenge issues unique to Japan, particularly the simultaneous aging of the overall population and the low birth rate causing a reduction in workforce size and a serious shortage of entry-level workers. The plan is to \"spread the use of robotics from large-scale factories to every corner of our economy and society.\" China is just finishing their 12th 5-year plan (2011-2015) and has hired MIT to help formulate a manufacturing, automation and robotics roadmap for the 13th 5-year plan to be released in November, 2015. The present plan to improve quality and automation efficiencies in manufacturing and stimulate an in-country robotics industry (instead of buying robots from elsewhere) is paying off and the numbers show its success: CRIA reports that robot sales in China increased by 54.6% in 2014 to around 57,000 units, 25% of the global total. Nearly 17,000 units were made in China with a value of $474M, an increase of 60% from 2013.In 2011 the US announced $500M to be invested in automation and robotics as part of a $2.2 billion Advanced Manufacturing Initiative and in 2014 set up and funded a $1.3B program to establish 12 manufacturing communities -- regional centers -- for R&D in specific sciences unique to their regions. Each center will receive government and corporate funding to work on strategic automation, AI and robotics to strengthen American manufacturing methods and make it globally competitive.In 2014 Korea announced a $2.7 billion plan in response to the American, Japanese and EU plans. Their new plan is to help existing robotics businesses increase their sales as well as investing in disaster recovery and search and rescue robots and eldercare robots. It was their KAIST robot that won the recent DARPA Robotics Challenge.And there are many good-sized VC-backed funds attempting to stimulate the same set of goals. French Minister Arnaud Montebourg announced the creation of a private fund with $108M headed by Bruno Bonnell focused on service robotics made in France. A Chinese venture fund is providing $200M to partner with the Russian Skolkovo Institute to incubate Russian technology and robotics for manufacture and marketing in China. The new Commercial Drone Fund, $75M Sky Fund, Qualcomm Robotics Accelerator and Idea Hub are all examples of funds established by corporations already in the business to fund startups that might have a beneficial impact on their company and the industry.Thus far, 2015 has been a banner year for funding and incubating robotics and AI science development and startup ventures. There have also been many strategic acquisitions this year such as the sale of Segway, VGo, SMG, gomTec and Universal Robots as corporations add robotics and robot functionality to their arsenal of products and services. There is broad recognition within the business world of the value of robotics and that growing awareness, stimulated by government funding, is translating into dollars to tackle the science of AI, perception, mobility and navigation. Research companies are attempting to detail the rising trend by mining data from various segments within the industry. So far this year the sheer number of research reports has increased 7-fold from five years ago.And the year isn't over yet! There are sure to be interesting announcements at RoboBusiness coming up later this month, RoboWorld in Seoul in October, DroneWorld in November and iREX in Tokyo in December.

      "content": "GreyOrange, an India and Singapore-based materials handling startup, received $30 million in equity funding to ramp up production of their Butler shelves-to-picker robot system.GreyOrange currently has 300+ employees which it plans to double with this new funding. They have two products: a package sorter and Butler. Butler is a square version of the circular orange-colored robotic system that Amazon acquired from Kiva Systems in 2012. The Kiva process had proven invaluable in speeding up bringing goods from the warehouse, dynamically storing goods for the best access, and to shuttle goods to the pick and pack work stations -- all reasons why Amazon evaluated and then purchased Kiva for their internal use. The Butler version purports to do the same set of tasks and GreyOrange's list of clients are distribution center-based and include Flipkart, the Indian version of Amazon, Amazon India, and Delhivery, an integrator and provider of distribution center systems all over India.Two questions come to mind about the GreyOrange funding:Kiva Systems and Universal Robots were and are still two stars in robotics. They both sold for phenomenal amounts and they were both predominantly funded from their rapidly growing sales.Farhad Manjoo wrote in the NY Times recently about the propensity of startups to stay private. He cited executives not wanting to give up control nor be regularly scrutinized by those that don't really understand the business. This trend is causing valuations to differ for privately held versus publicly held companies (privately held valuations are higher). It is also causing public investors to miss out on the successful companies in this new growth industry.In John Markoff's new book Machines of Loving Grace he describes the principle on which the Kiva system was developed:Kiva Systems had the insight that the most difficult functions to automate in the modern warehouse were ones that required human eyes and hands, like identifying and grasping objects. Without perception and dexterity, robotic systems are limited to the most repetitive jobs, and so Kiva took the obvious intermediate step and built mobile robots that carried items to stationary human workers. Once machine perception and robotic hands become better and cheaper, humans could disappear entirely.Finally, a word about IP (intellectual property, e.g., patents and copyrights). GreyOrange has to be on Amazon's radar for possible IP infringement. I am presuming that GreyOrange has vetted their IP versus Kiva/Amazon and concluded that they are unique enough to not cause legal problems.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "The robotics industry is booming in China. Companies are deploying thousands of robots in all types of factories, particularly in the auto industry. Chinese companies that manufacture robots and their components are also growing. This article will focus on the 107 makers of those robots.UPDATED 8/17/15: China became the world's largest consumer market of industrial robots for the 2nd consecutive year, according to statistics released by the China Robot Industry Alliance (CRIA). Sales in China increased by 54.6% in 2014 to around 57,000 units, 25% of the global total. Data shows that nearly 17,000 units were made in China with a value of $474M, an increase of 60% from 2013.Various research reports are predicting that more than 250,000 industrial pick and place, painting and welding robots will be purchased and deployed in China by 2019. That figure represents more than the total global sales of all types of industrial robots in 2014! The Chinese government is encouraging the development of an in-country robotics industry because currently 3/4 of all robots purchased are from off-shore companies (albeit some with manufacturing and assembly facilities in China).We have been able to identify 47 Chinese companies and 5 startups that call themselves industrial robot makers, and another 26 which offer to provide integration services and speciality equipment. 34 more provide ancillary services, sensors and components to the robot makers. Overall, 107 Chinese companies are involved in industrial robotics. Many of these new industrial robot makers are producing products which, because of quality, safety and design, will only be acceptable to the Chinese market. In addition to growth in Chinese industrial robotics, progress in the service robotics sector is also healthy. A shining example of the 48 mostly new service robotic companies on the map is Shenzhen DJI Innovations, of quadcopter fame. DJI is projected to sell $1 billion of their devices in 2015. Two other notable growth areas in the service sector are materials handling and the production of unmanned air, sea and ground devices for China's developing space, military and defense industries. The consumer sector is also growing: robotic vacuums and personal/social robots are examples. Last Singles Day, a brand new shopping holiday in China, Alibaba sold over 70,000 Ecovacs robotic vacuum cleaners!The drivers propelling this boom are many and varied:The Robot Report and the research team at Robo-STOX\u2122 have been able to identify 194 companies that make or are directly involved in making robots in China. The CRIA (China Robot Industry Alliance), and other sources, proffer the number to be closer to 400. The Robot Report's Global Map is limited by our own research capabilities, language translation limitations, and scarcity of information about robotics companies and their websites and contact people. We could use your help adding to the map. Please send companies that we have missed (or are new) to info@therobotreport.com.You can explore the map online and filter it in a variety of ways. Use Google's directional and +/- markers on the left of the map to navigate, enlarge, and hone in on an area of interest (or double click near where you want to enlarge). Click on one of the colored markers to get a pop-up window with the name, type, focus, location and a link to the company's website.[Note: the map shows a single entry for the company headquarters regardless how many branches, subsidiaries and factory locations that company might have.]The Filter pull-down menu lets you choose any one of the seven major categories: (1) Industrial robot makers; (2) Service robots used by corporations and governments; (3) Service robots for personal and private use; (4) Integrators; (5) Robotic start-up companies; (6) universities and research labs with special emphasis on robotics; and (7) Ancillary businesses providing engineering, software, components, sensors and other services to the industry.As can be seen from the map at the top of the page, most all of the companies and educational facilities are located on the East Coast or in Central China. Very few are located in the Northeast or in Western China.The research firms predicting dramatic growth for the domestic Chinese robotics industry are also predicting very low-cost devices. Their reports are contradicted by academics, roboticists and others who point out that there are so many new robot manufacturing companies in China that none will be able to manufacture many thousand robots per year and thus benefit from scale. Further, many of the components that comprise a robot are intricate and costly, e.g., reduction gears from Nabtesco, Harmonic Drive and Sumitomo (all Japanese companies). Although a few of the startups are attempting to make reduction gears and other similar devices, the lack of these component manufacturers in China may put a cap on how low costs can go and on how much can be done in-country for the time being. Another negative is that all but auto manufacturers have short product cycles requiring any robots on the line to be extremely flexible. Worker flexibility is still crucial in Chinese manufacturing.In the chart below, the 194 Chinese companies are tabulated by their business type and area of focus.Again, we request your help adding to the map and making it as accurate and up-to-date as possible.

Money continues to flow to robotics. Jibo, Inc., the company behind the social robot Jibo which last year had the successful $3.7 million Indiegogo crowdfunding, is now focusing their partnering to those that are strategic and concentrate on the Asian market. The lineup of investors in this $11M add-on to the previous $25.3M Series A round includes:With this $11M, Jibo has now raised $38.6M and has announced a production schedule beginning in late Fall 2015 and through Spring 2016 for crowdfunded orders and preorders. Additional orders are waitlisted. It's easy to see that this round of funding focuses on the a serious expansion into the Asian market - the same marketplace where SoftBank and partners Alibaba and Foxconn are bringing their Pepper robot to market and NTT and Vstone are readying their Sota companion tabletop robot to compete. All the telcom giants want to participate in this new trend toward home social robots and devices to get the monthly Internet service slice of the pie. SoftBank is charging $100 per month for Pepper's connection services.Virtual Incision Corp., a developer of an in vivo mini-robot surgical device enabling minimally invasive colon and abdominal procedures, received $11.2 million which brings their total funding to date to $25.7M. Virtual Incision's robotically-assisted surgical device is an investigational device and is not commercially available.In their press release VIC said the funds will be used for a feasibility study on the use of the company\u2019s miniaturized robotically assisted surgical technology for colon resection, a procedure performed to treat patients with lower gastrointestinal diseases such as diverticulitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. \u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Below are recaps of the fourteen June and July fundings, IPOs and acquisitions for robot and robotics related companies, followed by a thoughtful piece by Farhad Manjoo of the NY Times about why start-ups are staying private. Also 3 earlier fundings just discovered.UPDATED 7/29/15 to add Rethink Robotics April add-on to an earlier Series D funding, $3M to Squadrone System to launch their HEXO+ flying camera, and Siemens' investment in Magazino in May.Surgical device maker Transenterix raised $50 million from an IPO and market switch which transferred their stock from the over-the-counter market to the special small-cap MKT Exchange on the NYSE. This followed on the heels of Corindus Vascular Robotics which raised $42 million in late May by offering 11 million shares at $3.80 and then went public on the same NYSE MKT exchange.SoftBank along with O'Reilly AlphaTech and shasta Ventures invested $20M into Fetch Robotics which recently demonstrated their Fetch and Freight robot system at ICRA in May. Also at ICRA was the Amazon picking challenge. Both Fetch and the challenge are focused on the material handling aspects of warehousing and distribution center operations and represent a hot area for capital expenditures in those applications.Foxconn and Alibaba invested $118M each into SoftBank Robotics in a strategic move sure to have long-term ramifications. Foxconn and Alibaba's combined investment equals a 40% share of the new SoftBank Robotic Group, an entity which holds the France-based Aldebaran Robotics, the new Pepper social robot, and the Pepper SDK software group.Orbotix, the maker of the Sphero line of toys, received $45M in equity funding from the Walt Disney Company and Mercato Partners bringing their total funding to date to $80M. Disney and Sphero have a new Star Wars game app.Robotic flatbread maker Zimplistic got $11.5M from two venture funds: a Southeast Asia private equity firm, NSI Ventures, and the venture arm of Robert Bosch GmbH, the global supplier of technology products and services for the auto and home. Zimplistic, the Singapore and Silicon Valley startup behind the Rotimatic, the home flatbread maker, sold over $5 million at their launch last year. Today, they have a backlog of $72M in orders and over 5,000 distribution partnership requests. Zymergen, which integrates robots, big data, and software to unlock the potential of biology of future materials, received $44 million in funding from Data Collective, True Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and other VCs.Squadrone System, a startup composed of a team experienced in movie production, launched their HEXO+ flying follow-me camera to a very successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014 raising $1.3M from 2,300 supporters. In June, 2015, they secured a $3M investment from Living Water Investment Corp., and they have received loans from a series of French banks bringing their total funding to $5M.Teledyne invested capital to increase their ownership stake to 37% in Ocean Aero, the San Diego based unmanned naval systems startup. The amount of the transaction was undisclosed. Ocean Aero is developing autonomous, highly persistent, wind/electric unmanned vessels for surveillance, research and oil and gas monitoring. Rethink Robotics added $13.4M to their Series D round of funding in April (the original Series D was for $24.6M in December) and added a new participant: GE Ventures.Siemens, the conglomerate, in May, bought 49.9% of Magazino GmbH, a German materials handling startup, for an undisclosed amount. A spokesperson said \"the new funding from Siemens is big enough to allow the growth of the team to up to 30 people (mostly high profile with phD or even Professors) within the next weeks and beyond that next year. Additionally the investment enables us to grow rapidly for the next three years without any further financing needs.\"Vecna, a robotic mobility provider for hospitals and warehouses, acquired VGo, a provider of mobile telepresence devices, for an undisclosed amount. Similar to the strategic acquisition of Segway by Chinese Ninebot - a situation where Segway was suing Ninebot for IP infringement - and where Segway's IP passed on to Ninebot, VGo's IP, which has already undergone thorough court vetting, passes its IP to Vecna in the acquisition.Bimba Manufacturing acquired Intek Products for an undisclosed amount. Both are American companies that manufacture actuators and other automation and motion components for robot makers and others.Video compression and image processing semiconductor manufacturer Ambarella acquired VisLab, a lab within the University of Parma focused on perception systems, for $30M. VisLab has developed computer vision and intelligent control systems for automotive and other commercial applications including ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) and several generations of autonomous vehicle driving systems including \u201cPorter,\u201d the autonomous vehicle that made a 13,000 km trip from Italy to China in 2010. Canadian sUAS developer Draganfly Innovations was acquired by TRACE Live Networks, a California company with operations in Calgary and Toronto. No information was available as to the amount of the transaction. TRACE said that the two companies will collaborate on the further advancement of the TRACE Live Network auto-follow devices and live-streaming platform. They will also initiate development of several commercial applications for TRACE's visually intelligent SmartCamera technology.I've excerpted a few paragraphs from the NY Times article \"As More Tech Start-Ups Stay Private, So Does the Money\" by Farhad Manjoo. The whole article is worth reading.Something strange has happened in the last couple of years: The initial public offering of stock has become d\u00e9class\u00e9. For start-up entrepreneurs and their employees across Silicon Valley, an initial public offering is no longer a main goal. Instead, many founders talk about going public as a necessary evil to be postponed as long as possible because it comes with more problems than benefits.\u201cIf you can get $200 million from private sources, then yeah, I don\u2019t want my company under the scrutiny of the unwashed masses who don\u2019t understand my business,\u201d said Danielle Morrill, the chief executive of Mattermark, a start-up that organizes and sells information about the start-up market. \u201cThat\u2019s actually terrifying to me.\u201d...Silicon Valley\u2019s sudden distaste for the I.P.O. \u2014 rooted in part in Wall Street\u2019s skepticism of new tech stocks \u2014 may be the single most important psychological shift underlying the current tech boom. Staying private affords start-up executives the luxury of not worrying what outsiders think and helps them avoid the quarterly earnings treadmill.During a recent presentation for Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s limited partners \u2014 the institutions that give money to the venture firm \u2014 Marc Andreessen, the firm\u2019s co-founder, told the journalist Dan Primack that he had never seen a sharper divergence in how investors treat public- and private-company chief executives. \u201cThey tell the public C.E.O., \u2018Give us the money back this quarter,\u2019 and they tell the private C.E.O., \u2018No problem, go for 10 years,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Andreessen said....At some point this tension will be resolved. \u201cPrivate valuations will not forever be higher than public valuations,\u201d said Mr. Levitan, of Maveron. \u201cSo the question is, Will private markets capitulate and go down or will public markets go up?\u201dIf the private investors are wrong, employees, founders and a lot of hedge funds could be in for a reckoning. But if they\u2019re right, it will be you and me wearing the frown \u2014 the public investors who missed out on the next big thing.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Nvidia is riding high on chips for games and artificial intelligence, but it also got a nice one-time boost from the launch of the Nintendo Switch video game console. Nvidia's Tegra processor serves as the brains of the Switch, which was launched in March. The Switch can be played both on the TV or on the go as a portable device, and the power-efficient Tegra helped make that dual-play capability possible. In the fiscal first quarter ended April 30, Nvidia reported Tegra processor revenue of $332 million, up 108 percent from a year ago and up 29 percent from the previous quarter. The Tegra revenue also included record automotive processor revenue of $140 million, mainly from infotainment modules. The automotive revenue was up 24 percent from a year earlier and up 9 percent from the previous quarter. Overall, Nvidia beat analysts expectations, reporting 85 cents a share on revenue of $1.94 billion. Analysts expected Nvidia to earn 66 cents a share on revenue of $1.91 billion. Earnings per share were up 85 percent from a year ago, and revenues were up 126 percent. Nvidia is riding high not only on graphics for game consoles and gamer PCs, it is also hitting its stride with processors for artificial intelligence, automotive platforms, and data center hardware. \"The AI revolution is moving fast and continuing to accelerate,\" said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, in a statement. \"Nvidia's (graphics processing unit) GPU deep learning platform is the instrument of choice for researchers, internet giants and startups as they invent the future. \"Our Datacenter GPU computing business nearly tripled from last year, as more of the world's computer scientists engage deep learning. One industry after another is awakening to the power of GPU deep learning and AI, the most important technology force of our time,\" he said. ",

      "content": "Augmented reality may be the future of games, but there are some huge problems that stand in its way. So we decided to gather three of the biggest AR visionaries and product makers to show us the path to the future at our GamesBeat Summit 2017 event last week. Our panelists included John Hanke, CEO of Niantic Labs and co-creator of Pokemon Go; Ralph Osterhout, CEO of Osterhout Design Group, maker of augmented reality glasses; and John Underkoffler, CEO of Oblong Industries, maker of the Mezzanine collaboration software and science advisor for the film Minority Report. They are all unabashed fans of science fiction, and yet they have to deal with the realities of where technology is. Still, we asked them to speculate about the future of things, from privacy issues of augmented reality to what Pokemon Go 10 could be like. Osterhout is a developer, designer and entrepreneur. In his career, he has developed over 2,000 different products and hundreds of separate product lines for companies ranging from startups to Fortune 500s, as well as the government. He founded ODG in 1999, after several decades founding, building, and selling companies in consumer products, sporting goods, defense contracting, personal electronics, and high tech toys. Ralph has over 250 U.S. patents and applications to his name and more than two decades working with head-worn displays. He was the designer of the PVS7 Night Vision Goggles and heads-up displays in scuba masks. But he still can't make AR glasses with awesome visuals for just $500. Above: AR visionaries panel at GamesBeat Summit 2017. Underkoffler has been trying to make the vision of the 2002 film Minority Report, where actor Tom Cruise uses \"data gloves\" and gestures to control a transparent computer, into a reality. He founded Oblong in 2006, and launched Mezzanine for enterprise collaborators in 2012. Oblong's technological and design trajectories build on 15 years of foundational work at the MIT Media Lab, where Underkoffler was responsible for innovations in real-time computer graphics systems, optical and electronic holography, large-scale visualization techniques, and the I/O Bulb and Luminous Room systems. Hanke has been running Niantic and riding the rocket ship of Pokemon Go, which has more than 65 million monthly active users and has generated more than $1 billion in revenue in less than a year. His company is dedicated to building \"real world\" mobile gaming experiences that foster exploration, exercise and social interaction. Niantic has developed and released two games, Ingress and global phenomenon Pokemon Go. The company was originally founded as a startup within Google to explore the creation of new kinds of entertainment at the intersection of location, social, and emerging mobile devices. Niantic was spun out as an independent company in 2015 with backing from investors such as Google, Nintendo, and The Pokemon Company. Earlier in his career, Hanke was a founder of Archetype Interactive, creators of one of the very first online massively multiplayer games, Meridian59, and then went on to cofound Keyhole, a company acquired by Google for the technology that lead to the creation of Google Earth. He was vice president of Google's Geo division (overseeing projects including Maps and Street View) for seven years before founding Niantic. He has also been waiting a long time for the tech to mature. \"Hollywood gave us Hal (the talking computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey), and we got the TRS-80 (the ancient text-based computer system),\" Hanke said.

      "content": "Whether you're an entrepreneur, an investor, or a reporter, stress comes with the job. But taking an hour out of your day to meditate or practice yoga isn't always a realistic goal. Enter Simple Habit, a sort of Netflix for meditation, whereby users can choose from a variety of five-minute sessions tailored to help them overcome challenging professional situations like public speaking or asking for a raise. What's more, the app can also help with such social situations as going on a date or giving a toast. The San Francisco-based startup announced today funding of $2.5 million in a seed round led by New Enterprise Associates (NEA). The app, which is available on both iOS and Android, offers more than 1,000 meditating sessions -- 50 free ones, with the possibility to upgrade to a Premium version for $11.99 per month or $99.99 per year. Extra features include unlimited access to all premium content as well as the ability to download a session and use it offline while on a flight, for example. Simple Habit's founder and CEO, Yunha Kim, claims that more than 400,000 users have downloaded the app in the past eight months. Kim is well acquainted with the startup world, having sold her previous company Locket to Wish in 2015. The entrepreneur began working on Simple Habit while studying business at Stanford, later dropping out to focus entirely on her new project. Fresh out of Y Combinator's Winter 2017 batch, Simple Habit is entering a market that's already flooded with meditation apps like Headspace, Aura, Calm, Stop, Breathe & Think, and OMG, I Can Meditate! So what's different here? \"Simple Habit is a marketplace of meditation teachers, rather than a single teacher meditation app,\" wrote Kim, in an email to VentureBeat. \"We bring top meditation and mindfulness teachers from all over the world, ranging from experts that teach positive psychology at universities, to executive coaches and godfathers in the mindfulness space, and make them available in one place.\" According to Kim, the app targets busy people with specific needs, like engineers who seek to sharpen their focus or anxious employees who are dealing with difficult coworkers. Simple Habit was founded in 2016 and currently has four employees. FJ Labs, Foundation Capital, YC, and founders of Dropbox and Gusto joined NEA in today's round. ",

      "content": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are continuing to level the playing field for businesses of all shapes and sizes, especially when it comes to enabling capabilities that have been available to only the largest of organizations. And this is especially true in the way apps and websites are leveraging access and insights from first and third-party data sources to compete with consumer-focused behemoths such as Amazon. An example of this in action? Barnraiser -- the good food and healthy living platform -- has announced today the launch of its new Discover search and recommendation engine, which uses machine learning to help users continually explore and engage with the growing amount of information available from its 40,000 food makers, farmers, chefs, and tastemakers. Barnraiser has already seen a good level of success since it was founded in 2014. Based in Sausalito, Calif., the company has raised over $2 million in funding. Billed as a crowdfunding site for good food and healthy living -- a Kickstarter for foodies, if you will -- it was founded by its CEO, Eileen Gordon, who told me she started the business as a way to \"connect the millions of Americans who want sustainable farming with those that are making, growing, and providing the food.\" \"We're enabling the growing consumer base to connect with the growing maker base,\" Gordon said. Today's launch shows how machine learning and AI capabilities are offering smaller businesses the opportunity to play on a world stage. I've seen Barnraiser's Discover in action, and it provides functionality that could be described as the child of Pinterest's boards and Amazon's recommendation engine.  By using machine learning to understand user affinities and preferences, it not only provides relevant search results and recommendations but also proactively suggests new experiences for each user. And while the platform has had an extraordinary success rate for funding food projects -- Forbes reported last year that 65 percent of projects on Barnraiser are successfully funded, versus around 26 percent for Kickstarter -- these new capabilities will help drive higher engagement, further increasing the chance of success. Of course, as user participation increases so does Barnraiser's ability to generate revenue -- for itself, and for makers who use the platform. \"We monetize the site through both native ads and content and commissions on the transactions, funding, and subscriptions associated with each project,\" Gordon said. Mostly, Barnraiser's story shows the current impact of machine learning and AI. These capabilities are allowing emerging startups the ability to punch well above their weight and to scale quickly. \"We've launched our Discover platform with over 40,000 food makers, farmers, chefs, and tastemakers to connect with the 80 million people in the U.S. who care about how they eat and live,\" Gordon said. \"The platform gives exposure to the producers and brands of all sizes to find new audiences, raise capital, and connect with customers.\" ",

      "content": "Tech mogul Michael Dell and his top lieutenants were out in force in Las Vegas on Monday to show that the $67 billion combination of Dell Computer and storage giant EMC, completed eight months ago, was worth every penny. In his kickoff at the Dell EMC World conference, Mr. Dell reiterated his argument that the combined Dell Technologies \"can innovate like a startup but with the scale of a huge company.\" The conference had the usual blizzard of product announcements including fast all-flash storage hardware for businesses and a preview of \"14th-generation\" Dell PowerEdge servers due later this year. There were also plans to offer customers pay-as-you-go pricing for PC and other hardware. Analyst Patrick Moorhead, founder and CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy, found the last announcement most interesting. \"Programs that let you buy equipment as you would pay for it in the cloud, takes one cloud advantage off the table,\" Moorhead said via email. The reason is that cloud computing, a model exemplified by Amazon Web Services, lets customers pay for only the hardware and software they use for the time they use it. If they shut it off, the bill stops. That means many big businesses that once paid hundreds of thousands of dollars every three years or so for new servers and storage, as well as more money for big enterprise software licenses, no longer have to make those big up-front purchases if they don't want to. The popularity of that model has upended traditional tech companies like, well like Dell and EMC, as well as IBM, HP, and Cisco. Even Microsoft, which was not a big hardware player, was hit hard by the advent of Amazon Web Services and, in response, rushed to embrace cloud computing. If Dell can offer flexible and affordable hardware pricing without the big up-front commitment, that could help stop its bleeding. But can the new Dell Technologies fulfill Mr. Dell's promise of startup-style innovation, despite Dell's gargantuan size? Moorhead is bullish. He noted a stronger tie-in between the various Dell products than ever. But customers who want to use Dell servers with some other company's storage can do so. Matt Eastwood, analyst and senior vice president with research firm IDC, said Dell Technologies' status as a private company is a big advantage. In the merger, EMC morphed from a publicly traded company to part of a privately held giant. Now, the combined company \"can run the portfolio of companies/brands differently based on the maturity of the market,\" Eastwood said. \"They are more nimble than their peer competitors. HPE is directly responding by cutting divisions. But it is also sacrificing intellectual property.\" Others have their doubts whether the new Dell Technologies can do better than its predecessor companies. Andy Palmer, who has founded several tech companies, and has also been a customer of Dell and EMC, is uncertain. \"If anyone can sort this out, it's Michael Dell. But EMC was tough to work with and has gotten so far away from the needs of the average business it's challenging for them to move the needle,\" Palmer said. Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst of Constellation Research, who did not attend the conference, said he is not sure that Dell is even a tech company anymore. Instead, he views it as a company owned by a private equity investors that will act in the best interests of that private equity firm. \"As with most PE firms, innovation is put aside for profitability over passion,\" he said.

      "content": "Increasingly, companies are turning to artificial intelligence to understand what people say about their products and services on Twitter or Facebook. The goal is to react more quickly to complainers and perhaps sell more stuff to happy customers. But with sarcasm, there is a big gap between what people say and what they mean. And, because computers tend to take everything literally, they simply don't get the joke. For example, \"You look wonderful\" can mean two very different things depending on the context and the speaker. It could mean that you do, in fact, look great, or it could mean the opposite coming from the late comedian Don Rickles, with his trademark exaggerated eye roll. This is one reason people still get frustrated with Apple's Siri, Amazon Alexa, and other virtual personal assistants: They tend to get lost in a world laced with irony. This is a tough problem for AI to handle, but one that conversational analytics startup Gong, based in Tel Aviv with U.S. offices in Palo Alto, Calif., hopes to solve. Companies wanting to fine-tune online recommendations, for example, would like to know if a user who wrote, \"I loved this movie\" is serious or flippant. It's a problem that film information site The Internet Movie Database tries to overcome using an algorithm that analyzes people's comments to automatically create a rating of one to 10. But, a user who says a movie is \"fantastic\" could generate an excellent review that really does not reflect the user's intent if he or she meant it sarcastically, Lotem Peled, chief data scientist for Gong, tells Fortune. The problem is that \"input may be sarcastic but output is not sarcastic,\" she adds. She therefore created a neural network, basically a system that collects conversational data and automatically tries to make sense of it, without programmers having to intervene much. Any sort of AI project needs to test its theories and hypothesis, so Peled built her own data set from a massive number of tweets over the past few months. During the lead up to the U.S. presidential election, there was \"lots of sarcasm out there\" to work with, she joked. Peled is interested in researching problems where AI technology still lags human intelligence. \"AI is very advanced in some aspects, but in terms of understanding human nuances it's still pretty far off.\" She conducted research at Technion Israel Institute of Technology, and now Gong is incorporating it in its own software. By getting a better handle on what people really mean, Gong thinks it can help do some very pragmatic things like helping sales people close more deals. To accomplish that, Gong records phone or online conversations between sales people and customers or would-be customers. By analyzing information about who speaks longer -- the buyer or seller -- as well as pauses in the conversation, along with how many deals get done, Gong says it can help sales teams sell better. Gong technology can thus be used in conjunction with business software from Salesforce and other companies, she noted, that teams use to track sales and target potential customers. \"It's not quantitative but qualitative data,\" said Peled, whose project, which she calls the \"Sarcasm Sentimental Interpretation GeNerator\" (SIGN), is detailed here. Basically, Peled's system looks at conversations and parses not only words for what is positive or negative as well as pauses between speakers and words. then it maps the conversations to sales outcomes. Did this chat lead to an additional sale or not? To be fair, virtually every software company, including Salesforce, Microsoft, Google and others are talking a lot about integrating AI smarts into their products. Gong's secret sauce thus far appears to be its ability to suss out sarcasm. Above: Gong relies on artificial intelligence to detect sarcasm. There are also important noncommercial uses for this research. Improving AI's understanding of sarcasm could help people with autism or Asperger's syndrome, who often have difficulty discerning whether others are being sarcastic, by cuing them in to the meaning of what people say to them. There are other nuances that AI could address better as well. For example, knowing when words are meant literally or figuratively can avoid a lot of problems. Anyone who remembers the late, great Get Smart sitcom of the 1960s may recall that Hymie the Robot was overly literal. When someone told Hymie to \"kill the lights,\" for example, Hymie would shoot out the lights. This story originally appeared on Fortune.com. Copyright 2017 ",

      "content": "The selection of voice apps available for Google Home has grown larger in recent weeks, and now includes a Google I/O action, a guess-the-startup-founder game show, and a service that features favorite poems as read by actors and actresses. Voice apps on Google Assistant are called actions. Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa refer to these as skills. More than a dozen third-party actions have been made available to Google Assistant for Google Home users in recent weeks, and more than 230 third-party actions are now listed by the Google Home app since the launch of the Actions on Google platform last December. It's going to be an exciting, interesting few weeks in the intelligent assistant world as Microsoft is widely expected to release its Cortana software development kit and the Cortana Skills Kit for making third-party integrations for the intelligent assistant later this week at the Build conference. The Harman Kardon Invoke with Cortana inside is due out in fall 2017. Amazon is also expected to release a new touchscreen Alexa-enabled device this month just weeks after the Echo Look hit the market. The My Favorite Poems action made by Opearlo features poems read by professional actors. Each poem in the collection can be \"pinned\" or saved for later, so you can make your own collection of favorites as you listen to performances from actors and actresses. Could we get a poetry equivalent of Spotify that learns your taste and helps you discover new poems? I sure hope so. Last week VentureBeat published a story stating that a Google Home action for Google I/O was released, then pulled back. The action was likely pulled because it didn't work. Well, Google has released the action again ahead of the conference taking place May 17-19 in Mountain View, California. Now it can give you a full description of any I/O session by topic from Google Play to VR to machine learning and AI. While the action has much to say about sessions, it's mum on the keynote, where most of the news is actually made. Ask about keynotes and the Google I/O action says: \"Oh, the keynote is going to be awesome this year. Sundar Pichai will start at 10 a.m. on the first day.\" Ask other questions and the action may say little random things like \"There are rumors of swag at I/O. Some say if you think hard enough it will appear.\" In other new services, the UV Meter action will tell you the current ultraviolet (UV) rays index in a given city. This action joins others built to deliver information about the world around you, including actions made to tell you about tide levels and air quality. The Time Machine action will summarize and provide new headlines for any date in history going back more than 150 years. This skill draws upon New York Times headlines published between 1851 to the present. Continuing a trend of games for Google Home on Google Assistant, 6 Swords is an interactive role-playing game (RPG) that lets you \"manage a team of six mercenaries.\" In the game you can move in any direction through towns, prairies, castles, and dungeons. Players can collect gold, recruit other mercenaries, fight other players, and exchange items like gold or weapons. Each mercenary has a specific amount of hit points when they battle others, and players can interact via an online forum. The Guess the Founder game asks you questions about startup founders, and the Hitchhiker's Guide Quiz asks Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy questions. As is sometimes the case in burgeoning voice app ecosystems, both of these actions are a great idea, but the data or corpus of knowledge they draw upon falls short. The same can be said of the new Date Night action. Examples of Google Assistant actions that draw upon large amounts of knowledge include WikiHow for DIY tips and the Bible reader action from bible.com. There's also a Voice Tic Tac Toe action, which is exactly what it sounds like. Other recent additions include The Piano Guy, Utah Football Fan Trivia, and WUFT, only the second local radio station available as a Google Assistant action. Google Assistant actions, though in truth no actions are necessarily needed for radio stations since Google Assistant will play any radio station you ask it. ",

      "content": "Recently, Kitty Hawk (backed by Google's Larry Page) grabbed attention for showcasing its version of a flying car, which requires no pilot license. In a slick video, the prototype vehicle is seen gliding through the waters before hovering about 15 feet in the air. But interestingly, Kitty Hawk Flyer may not be the only car soaring in the air. The concept of vertical take-off and landing (VTOP), or flying cars, allows aircraft to reach high speeds without needing runways, instead taking off like helicopters. A few of the many names that are already working on VTOP designs are Lilium, Uber, and Airbus. Here's what they're up to. The Munich-based firm Lilium brings the concept of personalized, clean, and affordable air travel to everyone. The aircraft concept was initiated in 2013 by CEO and cofounder Daniel Wiegand and now receives the backing of investors like Skype cofounder Niklas Zennstrom and Wunderlist founder Christian Reber. Lilium recently completed its maiden test flight of a two-seater Eagle prototype. The firm is hoping to use the concept for urban air taxi services for up to five people, enabling passengers to travel five times faster than in a car. These jets are expected to fly as fast as a Formula One racer with no special infrastructure required. The Lilium Jet is the world's first all-electric VTOL jet and boasts a signature mid-air transition from hover mode to wing-borne forward flights. The emission-free jets have zero operational environmental impact, according to the company. Lilium services will be available on demand with a simple click that allows customers to order an air taxi to the nearby landing pad and \"take off with a push of a button.\" Its on-demand air transport is expected to turn into a reality in 2025. The firm is working actively with leading mobility service providers to deliver an all-in-one user experience from booking to landing. A dominant name in the auto-sharing industry, Uber is not very far behind in moving ground transportation to the skies. This year the $68 billion startup brought its version of flying car to its recent Uber Elevate Summit in Dallas. As of now, Uber does not plan on building its own aircraft. Instead, it is actively teaming up with real estate partners and aircraft companies for building landing pads and vehicles. Uber Elevate announced its plans to partner with Dallas-Forth Worth and Dubai to launch flying cars, with a pilot in Dallas-Fort Worth area by 2020 and flights in Dubai in time for Expo2020. Its alliance with VTOL aircraft manufactures like Embraer, Bell Helicopter, and Aurora Flight Sciences means that Uber is serious about taking ride-hailing to another level. It also hopes to eventually offer its flying car ride for about the same price as an UberX ride. The initial intention of Uber's flying dream was published in its white paper released last fall, which outlined a future filled with on-demand air transportation that would shorten a two-hour drive from San Jose to San Francisco to a 15-minute flight. Uber has already teamed up with the world's largest charging network, ChargePoint, to develop special chargers for its fleet of electric flying cars at Uber Elevate Vertiports by 2020. The European aerospace giant Airbus is addressing the future of urban flying through its distinctive projects. At Geneva's Motor Show in 2017, it unveiled its concept design in collaboration with the legendary coach builder Italdesign. Through its modular functionality, the car will operate both on ground and air. The design of the futuristic project, called Pop.Up System, contains fully electric functions, along with a capsule for two passengers. The capsule on wheels is enabled by an artificial intelligence (AI) process that becomes familiar with the individual operator and offers the best possible routes and transit options. Airbus has been pursuing its flying-taxi initiative since 2016. Project Vahana is a self-piloted flying vehicle concept that involves developing a new type of vehicle for individual passenger and cargo transport. Vahana uses VTOL, along with sense-and-avoid technology, and is slated to be tested toward the end of 2017. Unlike Vahana, Airbus' other distinctive project, CityAirbus, is designed for multiple passengers and will initially be maneuvered by a pilot before going fully autonomous. But even though flying on a hybrid jet sounds enticing, it faces practical roadblocks. Regulations, longer battery life for extended travel, and passenger safety within the limit of high speeds could be some of the many concerns that may act as potential barriers. In a conversation with Bloomberg, Tesla's Elon Musk pointed out, \"If somebody doesn't maintain their flying car, it could drop a hubcap and guillotine you.\" Above: VB Profiles Connected Cars Landscape.

Manhattan-based Maple, a startup that prepared and delivered meals without the help of restaurants, is shutting down after launching nearly two years ago and raising $29 million from Thrive, Greenoaks, and New York food deity David Chang. Not long after its launch, Maple was touted as \"insanely efficient\" and \"Chipotle-crushing,\" but documents leaked last year showed the business was burning cash with every meal it moved. Maple announced its shutdown in New York -- its sole market -- in an email to customers today.

      "content": "The trend in semiconductor startups is to make chip design easier and more customizable. That's what startup Flex Logix Technologies is doing, and it's why the company was able to raise $5 million in funding today. Mountain View, California-based Flex Logix has come up with a way to design cores for field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) that allows a chip to change its identity, even after it has been shipped. A chip startup can use Flex Logix cores to set itself apart through intellectual property (IP) designs, a growing part of the $335 billion-plus chip industry and a strategy that has been pursued by successful IP companies such as ARM, Imagination Technologies, Rambus, and SiFive, which announced $8.5 million in funding today. Existing investors Lux Capital and Eclipse Ventures led the round, with participation from the Tate Family Trust. Flex Logix will use the money to expand its sales, applications and engineering teams to meet growing customer demand for its embedded FPGA platform in a variety of applications such as networking, government, data centers and deep learning. \"We believe that Flex Logix's embedded FPGA has the potential to be as pervasive as ARM's embedded processors have become today,\" said Peter Hebert, managing partner at Lux Capital, in a statement. \"The company's software and silicon are proven and in use at multiple customers, paving the way to become one of the most widely used chip building blocks across many markets and for a broad range of applications.\" Customers in networking, data centers and deep learning are using Flex Logix's technology because it increases the return on the investment required to bring complex chips to market. Customers can use Flex Logix's blocks of programmable design code to fashion a single chip for multiple markets or upgrade the chip to deal with changing standards such as networking protocols. Customers can also easily update their chips with the latest deep learning algorithms or implement their own versions of protocols in data centers. In the past, the only way to accomplish these updates was through expensive and time-consuming new mask versions of the same chip. \"We now have customers with working silicon, multiple licensees and are seeing our first repeat designs,\" said Geoff Tate, CEO of Flex Logix, in a statement. \"With a large number of customers in active, detailed evaluation of our technology for a wide range of applications, we expect significant growth of our customer base in the near term. As a result, we're staffing up 'ahead of the curve' to ensure we can satisfy the demand.\" ",

      "content": "Popular city transport app Citymapper has revealed an ambitious plan to reinvent the humble bus, creating vehicles fit for the smart city era. Citymapper, if you didn't know, is a mobile app that rose to prominence in London for its user-friendly interface that combines multiple transport options to help users find their way from A to B based on their preferred criteria. For example, the app may give the quickest option using a combination of train, tram, and bus; or, if you've already invested in a rail card, it will give you train-only options; or it will also suggest a \"rain safe\" option that minimizes the amount of time walking between transport options during a torrential downpour. Since its inception in 2011, Citymapper has rolled out to dozens of conurbations globally, including New York, Boston, San Francisco, and Tokyo, and it has raised around $50 million in venture capital funding. The London-based startup has been at the center of much speculation over its future direction and how it plans to grow -- for many, it is a prime acquisition candidate, with companies such as Google surely keen to snap up the design team and data upon which Citymapper has grown. But few will have predicted that the hitherto software-only company would be toying with launching a physical bus and associated service. But that, it seems, is what it is doing. Kicking off in London this week, Citymapper is launching an experimental \"popup\" circular bus route (for free) with its own green, branded buses. Above: Citymapper buses. Similar to traditional buses, the Citymapper vehicles follow pre-set routes, with passengers able to jump on and off at bus stops. And for now, the vehicles have been given some technological overhauls. For example, there will be a large screen that shows riders where they are in real time, and what's coming up on the route -- similar to how its smartphone app works. And they also have USB charging ports. Above: Screen on the bus. If you're already familiar with transport apps such as Citymapper and Google Maps, you'll be aware of certain features that tell you which part of a vehicle is the busiest at a certain time of day -- for example, it may recommend that you enter the last coach on a train given that it should be the least busy. But such features aren't based on real-time information; they're estimates based on historical data. With its own bus, Citymapper has access to the very fabric of the vehicle, and it has installed its own tracking software that integrates directly with the app. It also boasts real-time passenger counting so it (and you) can know how busy a bus is. Looking to the future, it's easy to see how useful this could be if rolled out at scale. Imagine if every bus, boat, and train in London was kitted out with sensors and counters, with the data made available to third-party service providers -- this could help cities manage transport infrastructure far more effectively. Other than that, however, the first version of these buses are fairly standard, with a driver (yup, no autonomous aspirations yet), bells, and seats. But it's worth noting here that this is the very beginnings of what Citymapper is calling a push to create \"better mobility and cities,\" according to a blog post on the initiative. \"We're reinventing the entire software stack for running and operating a bus.\" We're already seeing interesting collaborations between ride-sharing services and city authorities to help improve congestion and planning efforts. Uber has partnered with cities such as Boston to offer trip-level data such as pickup/drop-off locations, distance traveled, and duration, which helps establish traffic patterns and may inform decisions around improving roads or creating parking zones. GPS data is also being collected from a number of other e-taxi platforms to improve road conditions in developing countries, while in China Didi Chuxing's data is being meshed with smart traffic light systems to ease road congestion. Citymapper's ambitions seem to fit nicely with these other efforts around the world, though with a focus firmly on improving public transport, it is bringing its own unique flavor to the mix. \"We built software for everything, including real-time operational control to driver management to scheduling systems,\" the company said. \"We're reinventing how to think about all of these in the real-time world. We've taken systems that haven't traditionally talked to each other and integrated them.\" The company hasn't elaborated on what's coming next with Project Grasshopper, but ultimately this is all about catering to the emerging smart city revolution. Buses typically follow set routes, but these routes may not serve people best if the majority of passengers typically have to walk 15 minutes once they disembark. And this is the challenge Citymapper is looking to solve with its new buses: How can it improve routes, or identify new ones that are sorely needed? \"In the era of smartphones we can have responsive buses that react to real-time needs,\" it said. \"Buses also get a bad rep, and are seen as a sub par experience. Even when they're the best transport option, some people don't take them. Perhaps we can help change that by improving the bus experience.\" This is one program we'll be keeping tabs on for sure. ",

      "content": "SiFive is pioneering a new model in the semiconductor business and to do so has raised $8.5 million in a second round of funding, led by Spark Capital. San Francisco-based SiFive is on a mission to democratize access to custom silicon chip designs. The company's founders invented RISC-V, a free and open instruction set architecture for modern microprocessors. It consists of all of the software instructions needed to program a microprocessor based on the RISC-V architecture. And SiFive is taking that architecture and making it easy to design the custom variants that companies need. So far, the RISC-V foundation has 60 member companies, including Google, HP Enterprise, Microsoft, IBM, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Samsung, Microsemi, and others. SiFive has developed its Coreplex IP (intellectual property) that others can license as they design their own processors and computing systems based on RISC-V. Osage University Partners and existing investor Sutter Hill Ventures also participated in the funding round. The new funds bring the total investment in SiFive to $13.5 million. SiFive founders Krste Asanovic, Yunsup Lee, and Andrew Waterman created RISC-V as a new instruction set architecture (ISA), just as Intel and ARM have their own ISA. But rather than having just one company own the ISA, the RISC-V creators made their ISA open and free to use. They monetize it through customization and support, much like Linux companies do with their open source operating systems. Above: SiFive founders Yunsup Lee (left), Krste Asanovic (middle), Andrew Waterman (right). In the first six months of availability, more than 1,000 HiFive1 software development boards have been purchased and delivered to developers in over 40 countries. Additionally, the company has engaged with multiple customers across its IP and system-on-a-chip (SoC) products, and it started shipping the industry's first RISC-V SoC in November 2016. \"At Spark Capital, we believe technology is the great equalizer. SiFive's singular goal of putting custom chips into the hands of everyone from startups to exploratory design teams to inventors with a healthy crowdfunding campaign resonates with our core values,\" said Todd Dagres, general partner at Spark Capital, in a statement. \"We are excited at the potential for SiFive to enable new and emerging sectors to bring innovative solutions to market that might otherwise never see the light of day.\" Members of the RISC-V foundation and third-party open source contributors are actively contributing to a maturing stable of software and tools. SiFive maintains an easy to install tool chain, software development kit, and other support necessary for customers to design and make their own RISC-V chips. In July 2016, SiFive launched its Freedom Everywhere platform -- designed for microcontroller, embedded, Internet of Things, and wearable applications -- and its Freedom Unleashed platform, for machine learning, storage, and networking applications. SiFive was recognized as the Startup of the Year by the 2016 ACE Awards and was recognized by the Linley Group's Analyst Choice Awards. The team has also created a textbook to teach students about computer architecture. Above: HiFive1 development board sells for $59. Earlier this month, SiFive launched its Coreplex IP and announced a growing ecosystem of partners, including Faraday, Microsemi, and United Design Systems, who are making SiFive Coreplex IP available to their customers. The company nearly tripled its employee base in the past year, adding leaders from Altera, ARM, Atmel, Cadence Design Systems, Cisco, Intel, Juniper, Marvell, Nvidia Qualcomm, Synopsys, and Xilinx. \"We are energized by the partnerships we have forged with our investors and their strong belief in SiFive's mission,\" said Jack Kang, the company's vice president of product and business development, in a statement. \"This investment will enable our continued growth for years to come and will allow SiFive to further establish that alternatives really matter in an era where traditional silicon vendors no longer are the most innovative in the industry.\" ",

      "content": "With recent speculation about Spotify soon going public (without an IPO) and the belated launch of Pandora Premium, the music streaming space is increasingly nearing both maturity and saturation. The market is crowded by such giants as Apple, Google, and Amazon, as well as smaller companies like Spotify, Deezer, Napster, Pandora, and Tidal. For 2016, it was estimated that Spotify had 43 million subscribers, followed by Apple Music  with 20.8 million and by Deezer with 6.9 million. At this point, it is unlikely that a new player can arise and grab a significant market share from the top players. However, it's worth noting that in the United States, paid and ad-supported music streaming together generated $3.9 billion in revenue in 2015. In contrast, live music generated $9.3 billion in revenue -- nearly three times as much -- for the same period. This points to the large opportunity in live music, and some of the same aforementioned companies are looking to expand into the market. It's almost a natural progression for these companies to expand from static audio streaming to live video streaming because they can leverage their experience with the music industry (think licenses, copyrights, etc.), as well as their existing platforms. For example, Pandora has run pilot livestreams with artists such as G-Eazy, Fall Out Boy, Jack White, and Mumford and Sons, and its product team is focusing on livestreamed shows. YouTube partners with large music festivals like Coachella and Ultra to livestream entire lineups. Twitter recently announced a partnership with Live Nation to livestream concerts. Tapping into the live concert space also makes sense because of people's interest in livestreaming generally. Thanks to Facebook Live and other services, livestreaming has gone mainstream. If we're already used to seeing livestreams of Trump press conferences on Facebook and NFL games on Twitter, then it isn't strange for to us watch Beyonce concerts on Spotify. But what's in it for the artists? Currently, many artists make most of their income from live concerts, not from streaming or digital sales. Won't livestreaming concerts cannibalize tickets for live concerts? It seems unlikely: In fact, 67 percent of livestream viewers are more likely to buy a ticket to a concert/event after watching a livestream of that concert/event or a similar one. Jordan Zachary, chief strategy officer of ticket sales company Live Nation, said the company's data shows that consumption of live content increases a fan's desire to attend the concert: \"Research shows that millennials highly value live experience, and we believe live attendance will continue to grow globally.\" Following this logic, livestreaming concerts may actually augment an artist's concert ticket sales. This is likely because the physical concert experience  --  acoustics, atmosphere, energy , etc. -- can never be completely replicated virtually. People pay for more than the live music  alone;  they pay for the live concert experience. And the people who watch online are likely those who find the physical concert geographically or cost prohibitive. They were not going to buy live concert tickets in the first place. Further, livestreamed concerts can help artists collect and analyze data. Artists could gather data about their fans and audience from live concert streams, much like they already do from traditional streaming tools, like Spotify's Fan Insights portal. If livestreaming concerts are merely additive and promotional for an artist, the opportunity to add another source of data about fans and audiences offers value for minimal risk. In addition, with virtual reality on everyone's minds, it should be no surprise that there are startups looking to livestream concerts in VR. In 2014, vantage.tv livestreamed Coachella in 360 in conjunction with the release of the Coachella VR app and cardboard. This year, with YouTube added to this partnership, Goldenvoice (the company that produces Coachella) integrated the 360 broadcast with a highly trafficked 2D broadcast so users could toggle between 2D and VR. So far, vantage.tv has recorded and created more than 120 in-venue live VR broadcasts from Outside Lands, Coachella, Lollapalooza, and other festivals. Another startup, TheWaveVR, livestreams concerts in VR and offers interactive features that enable users to touch equipment or dance in the landscape. AR, too, has potential to change live concerts beyond traditional livestreaming and VR livestreaming. This year, the Coachella app contained AR filters and overlays. In the future, we may start seeing more mixed reality and immersive media (like holograms) as part of live concerts. Live concert streaming and expansions into VR and AR represent new opportunities -- for both large companies and startups, that may reinvigorate the crowded streaming music category. The benefits of livestreaming concerts suggest that timing is right for music tech to play new a chord. Jaja Liao works in mobile partnerships acquisitions at Google. ",

      "content": "If you're tired of going to unproductive meetings, commuting in to work just to put in face time, or following commands from a boss you don't have much confidence in, you may be the right kind of employee for a new type of work environment called a DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization. We're in the early stages of seeing these futuristic types of companies roll out already. These early players have run into some missteps, but that's to be expected. What's important in the concept of a DAO is the D: \"decentralized.\" In a DAO, a blockchain-based organization, you don't have a boss or a CEO. What you have is a dynamic set of working relationships continuously and dynamically self-organized around outcomes and projects. To participate in a DAO, you must \"buy in\", literally. You need to own a \"token\" or \"coin\", the ownership of which is recorded in the blockchain. In the future, obtaining these coins will be easier. Today, the most common route is to buy Bitcoin with your dollars, euros, yen, etc. and then use the Bitcoin to buy the tokens or coins of the specific DAOs in which you wish to be a member. Increasingly, you can buy another crypto-currency, Ether (based on the Ethereum blockchain) as your entry point. For many people, Coinbase is the on-ramp of choice to this world from fiat. From there, people go through an exchange like Bittrex or Kraken. Alternatively, someone who has a coin can send you some. For example, if you want some IOP (Internet of People) tokens, I can get you some. If you're willing to do this, you've already earned it. Welcome aboard. Now, you're in.* (IOP is just one of many DAOs vying to make an impact. Full disclosure: I own some IOPs). Now that you are a \"member\" of the DAO, which is provable to all via the public, open ledger that is a blockchain, your compensation comes in two ways: The increase in the DAO's token value comes simply from supply and demand. As the total token supply for each DAO is either fixed or predictably inflationary and it is known to all, the value of the tokens increase along with demand. (A key benefit is that the supply of tokens is not easily subject to future dilution by central administrators such as government officials or incompetent executives. Ah, the power of blockchains!). While you can buy more tokens or simply sit back and watch/hope that the value of your tokens increases, you can also earn more of them by helping the DAO achieve its objectives. To understand how that works, there are a few things you need to understand about DAOs vs. traditional organizations. Unlike a traditional organization, the priorities of a DAO aren't \"set from the top.\" There's no command and control. There's no boss. While there may be active members of the community who have identified certain needs, say \"a new website\" or \"a new feature for an application,\" it's not a mandate. No one must do it. But if a project makes the DAO more valuable, useful, or meaningful for its members and for potential future members, then (and here's the beauty of it) people WANT to do it. It's in their own best interest to do so. Because the one thing that everyone in the DAO shares is this: Every single person wants the value of the tokens to increase. So, everyone is hyper-focused on putting as much value into the DAO as possible and, conversely, extremely disinterested in doing anything that doesn't add value. And this is where the opportunities abound for people like you. If you identify an opportunity to add value to the DAO -- \"Hey, the website is too slow and I can make it more responsive\" (for example) -- you can submit a Contribution Contract (here's how you can do it for IOP and for DASH) to the community and make the proposal. You lay out what you are going to do for the DAO and how you think it will add value. The other existing token holders have an opportunity to vote on your proposal. If your proposal is persuasive in that others believe it is really going to increase the value of the token, then it will pass. If it isn't, then it will fail. We can dive into the different forms of DAO governance another time, but for now, let's assume this voting system works well enough. And let's assume your proposal passes. You commit to a set of deliverables over a period and, in return, you are \"paid\" by the DAO in new tokens at a predefined interval. You may earn 10 tokens every hour or 10 tokens every month. You set the price, others approve it or reject it. Once you have made a deal with the DAO, it's in the blockchain. You're good to go. Your job now is \"deliver or have your contract canceled.\" If you don't deliver, you lose credibility within the community and get perceived as someone who doesn't add value. You probably won't have too many opportunities to earn tokens in the future because people won't vote you in. Reputation matters ... a lot. This makes you hyper-focused on managing your time and efforts. Which is where the freedom from bad meeting tyranny comes in. At this point in your DAO relationship you are asking yourself, every moment of every day: \"Will this add activity value to the project?\" If yes, you do it. If no, then you say, \"You know, my skills and time are better spent elsewhere.\" And since there are no bosses, you don't catch any heat. Sure, there are politics, as is the case with any organization with more than one person, but it's of a different nature. In a \"traditional\" command and control environment, authority determines effort. That's why your boss can make you go to a bad meeting. In a decentralized environment, value contributed to the project's success determines influence. That influence determines where efforts should be focused. Bottom line: Your incentive is to create as much value as you can for the project, based on your skill set and beliefs, not based on what your boss thinks. We've heard the words \"radical transformation\" or \"radical disruption\" so many times that it has risen to \"boy who cried wolf\" levels. I get that. It sounds almost implausible. But, if you believe (as I clearly do!) that blockchain and decentralized technologies represent a once-in-a-generation type change that, like the Internet, will touch every aspect of our lives, then it isn't such a far cry to think that the entire way we work will change too. As Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos famously said, \"When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing a chance to be there at the beginning of the Internet? Yes.\" Make sure you don't miss the beginning of the DAO era. *Standard legal disclaimer here. This isn't an official \"giveaway\" or promotion. I'm just trying to help. I only have enough for 300 people and will do my best to process them. If you can't abide by these \"rules\", please don't send me a note.

      "content": "PR folks like us love startup founders: They're motivated, ambitious, a little crazy, usually very smart, and sometimes just downright quirky. You can learn a lot about human nature by working for many different startup CEOs. But you'll also notice some traits that can spell disaster -- not just for the company's PR efforts, but for the company in general. Here's a list of some of the toxic startup executive personalities we have encountered over the years, along with one personality type that we've found to be the most effective. Startup execs are as demanding as they are busy. They know what they want and they want it now (if not sooner)! So as a PR vendor, once hired you can expect to be thrown right into the fire... and sometimes under the bus. Beware the startup exec who can't wait for your guidance, only to completely disregard it and you. These execs want to take credit for everything: the setting sun, flowers blooming, etc. We've run across one or two who are absolutely certain that the stories they pitched to reporters were so important, they caused the reporters to be promoted or hired for new jobs. If you believe that line of garbage, I've got some swamp land in Florida to sell you. One of our favorite personalities is the exec who acts like a child. We run across these folks all the time and the trait often manifests itself when press coverage is being discussed. There's something about raising tens of millions of dollars in venture capital that makes an exec feel deserving of special attention from media. But here's a tip: Just because you want to be in the Wall Street Journal, doesn't mean you should be. This may seem like a positive personality trait, but really it isn't. The best PR programs are partnerships in which each side, the client and the vendor, attempts to outwork/outservice the other. When execs hire us and then disappear, the PR program inevitably fails. You're the CEO of an early stage startup. You've raised millions of dollars. You're hiring dozens of employees, many of whom have families that depend on your company to survive. So what in the world are you doing wordsmithing press releases?! First of all, you're a CEO, not a copy editor, so you probably have no idea what you're talking about. Second, get back to work on the important stuff. One exec we worked with was literally too rich to shake your hand. He'd made his tech money years ago, and his new gig as startup CEO was his way of forcing people he hired to listen to his wacky ideas. Among them was the notion that somehow bumping elbows rather than shaking hands would \"save your life.\" Or so he tried to convince us over a 6 am breakfast at some unnecessarily expensive hotel. As PR people, we're jaded when it comes to tech jargon. Sure, the occasional buzzword sometimes finds its way into one of our releases, but for the most part we understand that press don't like them, so we cut them out. But some startup execs just can't help themselves. They toss around tech jargon like frisbees. Seriously, what does it mean to \"hypertarget\" something? And what the hell is \"smart listening\"? Give me a break. One minute you're planning a product launch, interacting with the client back and forth, and the next he or she stops responding entirely, for days or weeks at a time. Then, all of a sudden, you get a call or email saying, \"We have to issue that press release now!\" Really? Where have you been for the last three weeks? And what happened to the plan we were discussing? These execs typically have a hard time delegating, which is why they've been ignoring your emails instead of asking their in-house marketing director to circle back with you on the product launch. Every industry has its deadbeats, and tech is no exception. We love the exec who has no problem asking you to do work but then is slow to pay or quick to question his or her invoice. Even better is the startup exec who cries poor after he or she has used hours and hours of your time. Who goes to a restaurant and orders an expensive meal without money in his pocket? Some startup execs, apparently. As a startup exec, if you're not passionate about your business, how can you possibly expect anyone else to be? While that's true, some execs take this too far. Passion tends to rub on off people in a good way, and if you're working long hours in a startup, there are worse things than a CEO who is constantly telling his employees that the work they're doing is changing the world. But like everything, moderation is important. Eventually, the overly passionate exec will not ring true. Hands down, this is our favorite startup exec personality type. The How Can I Help You exec is a rare breed, but when you find one, hold on and never let go. These execs understand that their job is to hire the absolute best people, then offer to help them succeed. We've had the privilege of working with a few such startup execs over the years. They're almost always super secure with themselves, never feeling like they have to prove something. They're passionate without being irritating. They actually listen! Come to think of it, execs with this personality trait have led some of the most successful companies we've worked with in terms of how they exited. Who knows, maybe there's something to that?

      "content": "Columbus, Detroit, Cincinnati, Chicago, Cleveland -- startup hot spots like these are popping up across the nation as innovation and entrepreneurship are on the rise. However, while momentum is building in the Midwest, several misguided business regulations are stunting the startup community's full potential. After much discussion with fellow VentureOhio board members, including Mark Kvamme of Drive Capital and the leaders at the NVCA, we've identified four key regulations in particular that are throttling growth: the Volcker Rule, Qualified Small Business Stock Rules, Section 382, and the Registered Investment Advisor Rules. Since Congress and the Trump administration are prioritizing regulatory structure, and tax reform is the premier economic policy issue under consideration in Washington. The startup community currently has a unique opportunity to make its voice heard and influence policymakers as they deliberate future regulations. The time is right to enact changes that can boost the entrepreneurial ecosystem to greater heights and encourage economic growth. Sparked by the financial crisis of 2007 - 2010, the Volcker Rule was created to prevent banks from taking unnecessary chances with your money. The rule is meant to protect financial stability by prohibiting risky speculative investments -- sounds good, right? Though beneficial on the surface, the rule was written in an overly broad fashion and ended up preventing banks from investing in venture capital funds. When the rule went into effect in 2015, banks stopped supporting venture capital funds, and some even went so far as to sell their interests on the secondary market in order to comply with the rule immediately. Venture capital funds aren't inherently risky and they're incredibly important to economic growth and opportunity. By preventing banks from investing in venture capital funds, the rule removed a key source of investment for a number of vital regional funds, which in turn decreased the amount of capital flowing toward innovative entrepreneurs and stunted startup growth. If we can encourage a narrower interpretation of the Volcker Rule and allow banks to invest in venture capital, we can reverse the effects and see an economic boost overall. Drive American job creation, innovation, and long-term economic competitiveness -- that was the goal of the QSBS. The idea was to award a generous tax benefit to investors who provided long-term capital investment to innovative small businesses. It's no wonder it passed with strong bipartisan support. Unfortunately, in a well-intentioned effort to prevent abuse of the program, Congress and the IRS created a labyrinth of strict and complex rules on what counts as a qualifying small business for investment. To demonstrate that a particular small business qualifies the investor for the benefit, the investor must adhere to a compliance process that can actually take a toll on the resources of even a Fortune 500 company. This creates hesitancy to invest and undermines the potential of the provision. If investors could have a better understanding of when their investment is eligible for the benefit, QSBS could be one of the most powerful federal policies for encouraging entrepreneurial capital formation in emerging startup regions. By reducing the complexity of the rules defining a qualified small business, the government could unleash the full potential of the QSBS. Written in mid-1980s, the loss limitation rules in Section 382 of the tax code are intended to prevent loss trafficking, or the strategy of companies acquiring failing businesses with enormous losses on their books for the sole purpose of using the tax losses to offset other unrelated income. Though intended to prevent large companies from abusing the tax system, the rules often impact startups. Startups often accumulate net operating losses (NOLs) when using investment capital to build a company. These NOLs can then be used during a future tax reporting period to recover past tax payments. Due to these accumulated NOLs, startups will often trip the Section 382 rules when they undergo a merger or acquisition. This causes them to lose value because their NOLs and research and experimentation (R&D) tax deduction credits are suddenly limited and a penalty on R&D expenditures is imposed. This plays out to be a tax penalty for investment in innovation and entrepreneurship, negating the effects of Section 174 which encourages R&D through an R&D credit system. It's time to reform this rule that has become a burdensome tax regulation for startups. These rules require a number of private funds to register with the SEC and undergo a substantial amount of compliance cost to continue functioning. These costs can be six, or even seven, figures annually. Because of the size of the burden, Congress wisely directed the SEC to exempt venture capital funds from this regulatory requirement, but it let the SEC define what constitutes a VC fund. The SEC took an excessively narrow view of the definition, and as a result, a number of venture capital firms have been subjected to this significant regulatory burden. Most affected have been growth equity funds, or later stage venture capital funds that often provide the capital for hiring and scaling for emerging companies. To allow the necessary access to capital for proven startups on the verge of scaling, the government should revisit the RIA definition in order to limit the regulatory and compliance burden on the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

      "content": "A Pew Research Foundation study examining the future of work and job training found a belief among some experts that artificial intelligence and automation threaten not just millions of jobs, but also the future of capitalism. Released Wednesday, the non-scientific study titled \"The Future of Jobs and Jobs Training\" is the seventh in an eight-part \"Future of the Internet\" study being conducted by the Pew Research Center and Elon University. More than 1,400 AI researchers, tech experts, professors, startup CEOs, and members of the general public responded to the survey. Respondents include leaders from companies like Google and Microsoft and educators from MIT, Harvard, and other universities, as well as a mix of other people interested in AI and the future of work. Tech experts include computer scientists and AI researchers but also people from internet governance groups, futurists, and startup founders. \"People will create the jobs of the future, not simply train for them, and technology is already central,\" said a Microsoft principal researcher. \"It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead.\" Not everyone was so optimistic. Several respondents questioned the point of training for a job that won't exist at all in the future. \"While the first three themes found among the responses to this canvassing were mostly hopeful about advances in education and training for 21st-century jobs, a large share of responses from top experts reflect a significant degree of pessimism for various reasons. Some even say the future of jobs for humans is so baleful that capitalism may fail as an economic system,\" the Pew report reads. The report states that most of the people who commented on capitalism in the survey chose to remain anonymous, but a few put their names to their thoughts. For example, Mike Warot, a machinist at Allied Gear, said, \"We're going to have to end up with a Basic Income, or revolution.\" Miles Fidelman is a systems architect and policy analyst at the Protocol Technologies Group. \"The trend is pretty clear. We will need less 'workers' in the future,\" he said. \"For a long time, science fiction presented us with visions of a world where machines did all the work and people enjoyed leisure, artistic pursuits, etc. These days, a more dystopian reality is emerging -- where a few party, a few more do a lot of work, and growing numbers search for work. We're going to need a fundamental reshaping of our economy, not training people for jobs that are simply not going to be there.\" A primary question in the survey was \"In the next 10 years, do you think we will see the emergence of new educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers in the skills they will need to perform the jobs of the future?\" About 70 percent of survey participants said they believe education and training programs will successfully prepare people for jobs of the future, but many respondents also believe education will not be sufficient to meet people's needs within the next decade, as automation and AI are expected to claim more human jobs. Respondents were also asked things like \"What skills will future workers need?\" and \"Which skills can and cannot be taught online?\" A mid-2015 Pew Research survey found that about two-thirds of U.S. citizens believe that within 50 years robots and automation will do the majority of the work done by humans today, though 80 percent of respondents said they expected their job to exist in the same period of time. In written responses, survey respondents collectively articulated five major themes and predictions: The ability to adapt was seen by survey respondents as one of the most important skills for the future. \"Interestingly, being able to adapt and respond to looming challenges was seen by nearly everyone in this canvassing as one of the most highly prized future capabilities; these respondents especially agree that it is important, and they say that our human institutions -- government, business, education -- are not adapting efficiently and are letting us down,\" the Pew study found. \"Many of them say that current K-12 or K-16 education programs are incapable of making adjustments within the next decade to serve the shifting needs of future jobs markets.\" Barry Chudakov, founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp, thinks that in the coming years people in search of jobs will redefine what it means to be a student, particularly as more digital education providers emerge. \"The key to education in the next 10 years will be the understanding that we now live in a world without walls -- and so the walls of the school (physical and conceptual) need to shatter and never go up again. In the (hopefully near) future, we will not segregate schooling from work and real-world thinking and development. They will seamlessly weave into a braid of learning, realization, exposure, hands-on experience and integration into students' own lives,\" he said. Respondents emphasized that in the coming decades there will be a need to learn not just how to code but also develop soft skills like interpersonal communication. Webby Awards founder Tiffany Shlain said she thinks people need curiosity, creativity, initiative, multi-disciplinary thinking, and empathy. Other skills referenced include critical thinking, community building, teamwork, and conflict resolution. Devin Fidler, a research director at the Institute for the Future, predicted that as automation and machine learning continue to get better, uniquely human skills will increase in value. \"There will be an increasing economic incentive to develop mass training that better unlocks this value,\" he said. Fidler's sentiment was echoed by Susan Price, a digital architect at Continuum Analytics. \"Increasingly, machines will perform tasks they are better suited to perform than humans, such as computation, data analysis and logic,\" Price said. \"Functions requiring emotional intelligence, empathy, compassion, and creative judgment and discernment will expand and be increasingly valued in our culture.\" Whether respondents agreed that workers are being trained for the jobs of the future or not, many expressed concern about the ability to reach these training goals in time to prepare workers for those jobs. A key concern was that jobs will change so quickly that training won't be able to keep up. Insufficient interest in retraining on the part of workers and a lack of political will to pursue the agenda were also cited. \"I have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps,\" said founder of Data & Society Danah Boyd. \"I have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socio-economic factors that are underpinning skill training.\" Boyd added that companies don't pay enough for retraining and governments lack the ability to tax companies \"at the level needed for public investment in reskilling.\" \"What's at stake are not simply skills gaps -- it's about how we want to architect labor, benefits and social safety nets. And right now, we talk about needing to increase skills, but that's not what employers care about. It just sounds nice. When computer science graduates from CUNY and Howard University can't get a job, what's at stake is not skills training.\" AI and automation are increasing at the same time that more Americans than ever -- seven in 10 high school graduates -- are expected to attend college. Baratunde Thurston, a director's fellow at MIT Media Lab, said he thinks the rapid changes mean education must extend beyond the four-year university degree. From the Pew report: \"We are creating a system of on-demand labor akin to 'cloud-based labor' where companies 'provision' labor resources at will and release them at will, not by the year or month but by the job, labor unit, or small time unit, including minutes,\" he said. \"This of course is a terrible, soulless, insecure life for the workers, but since when did that really change anything? There will also be a parallel call for benefits, professional development, and compensation that smooths out the rough patches in this on-demand labor life, but such efforts will lag behind the exploitation of said labor because big business has more resources and big tech moves too fast for human-scale responses of accountability and responsibility. To quote Donald Trump, 'Sad!'\" Fog Creek Software founder Anil Dash said certifications from a broader range of educational institutions are called for, but he predicted that the same biases that shape education today may still get in the way. \"These credentials will start to become widespread, but acceptance and quality of the training programs will map to the existing systemic biases that inform current educational and career programs,\" Dash said. Mike Roberts was the first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a nonprofit responsible for the management of internet domain names. He sees much turmoil on the way but believes that massive open online courses (MOOCs) will improve with time. Many respondents also said they believe that AR, VR, and AI will play a role in improving education for job training in the future. Most agreed that higher education institutions are going to be challenged as a shifting job and tech landscape changes the definition of education. \"The path forward for society as a whole is strewn with obstacles of self-interest, ignorance, flawed economics, etc. If one believes in 'the singularity', it doesn't matter, because human-machine symbiosis will bury the problem!\" Roberts said.

      "content": "For scrappy hardware startups and billion-dollar tech giants alike, product reviews matter. They're the first indicator of success or failure. As timelines from announcement to launch tighten, product reviewers get shorter and shorter deadlines. So companies came up with a solution: to offer beta hardware, also known as preproduction units. It is incredibly difficult for journalists to serve the reader with a preproduction unit. Am I supposed to guess which issues will be ironed out in the final product? Am I supposed to ignore all the software bugs because they can be fixed more easily and instead focus on the hardware issues? The logical thing to do is to include every issue and simply tell the reader this is not the product they will end up buying. But that is also a fruitless endeavor -- it doesn't help the reader or the company. As a result, I avoid writing reviews solely based on unfinished products. Do you want me to beta-test your new device? Great, send me a preproduction unit and I'll tell you, not the public, what I think. Do you want me to review your device? Great, make sure I get the final version in time. Let me spell that out again for companies and PR firms reading -- there are two good ways to use preproduction hardware. The first is to send the unit over and ask for feedback, not coverage.

      "content": "Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing is lending its data to authorities as part of a new initiative to ease traffic congestion. Earlier this year, Didi partnered with the traffic police department of Jinan, the capital of Eastern China's Shandong province, which claims a population of more than 7 million. Jingshi Road is one of the most heavily congested thoroughfares in the city, and in March, as part of a trial to help get cars moving more quickly, the city installed smart traffic signals. These use sensors embedded on the road to help sync the traffic lights in accordance with the shifting volume of vehicles. However, feeding into this is a vast swathe of real-time road data provided by Didi, which analyzes its gargantuan army of drivers to see where traffic is moving and where it is likely to become congested. This helps inform the traffic signal cycles so the gaps between light changes are tweaked to cater to shifting patterns of vehicle movement. Above: Smart traffic signals positioned at an intersection on Jingshi Road According to data provided by Didi, delays caused by congestion during rush hour dropped nearly 11 percent. As a result of this initial trial, authorities are now working on installing more smart traffic signal systems throughout the city. Didi Chuxing was formed in 2015 following a merger between local rivals Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache. Similar to Uber, Didi Chuxing offers smartphone-based car services, such as carpooling, taxis, and premium cars with drivers. Didi is the clear market leader in China, a fact that led Uber to merge its Chinese operations with Didi in a $30 billion deal last year. As part of its push to become a global player, Didi last week announced a whopping $5.5 billion funding round. However, China remains Didi's primary focus for now, and at the end of April the company revealed a new program to work with city authorities to \"resolve deteriorating traffic problems\" by offering up a new traffic data platform, called Didi Traffic. This is currently being used by regulators in Shenzhen, Jinan, and Wuhan. A number of other big data initiatives have sprung up from e-taxi firms elsewhere in the world. Uber has previously partnered with cities such as Boston for projects that involve analyzing trip-level data, including date and time, pickup/drop-off locations, distance traveled, and duration. This data helps establish traffic patterns and informs decisions around road improvements and parking zones, among other infrastructure projects. Elsewhere, GPS data derived from a number of e-taxi platforms is being used to improve road conditions in developing countries. Last April, the Open Traffic pilot program launched in the Philippines to show how real-time data can improve traffic and road conditions, with the World Bank backing a new open-source platform that used anonymized GPS data from thousands of Grab drivers to establish congestion patterns and travel times. The program was later opened to include other e-taxi companies, including Easy Taxi and Le Taxi, which collectively operate across dozens of markets, and it was extended into new countries, including Brazil, Malaysia, and Colombia. Didi says that it clocks around 20 million ride requests each day, processing around 2,000 terabytes of data as result. That's a colossal amount of information, and it's proving to be a useful byproduct of the company's ride-sharing service. Bike-sharing platforms have also risen to prominence in China as a consequence of heavy traffic. Back in March, bike-sharing startup Ofo raised $450 million, with Didi joining the funding frenzy, while competitor Mobike struck a deal with Tencent to bring bike sharing to WeChat users in China.

      "content": "(Reuters) -- The U.S. Department of Justice has begun a criminal investigation into Uber Technologies Inc's use of a software tool that helped its drivers evade local transportation regulators, two sources familiar with the situation said. Uber has acknowledged the software, known as \"Greyball,\" helped it identify and circumvent government officials who were trying to clamp down on Uber in areas where its service had not yet been approved, such as Portland, Oregon. The company prohibited the use of Greyball for this purpose shortly after the New York Times revealed its existence in March, saying the program was created to check ride requests to prevent fraud and safeguard drivers. The Times report triggered a barrage of negative publicity for the company. The criminal probe could become a significant problem facing the company that is already struggling with an array of recent business and legal issues. An Uber spokesman and the Justice Department declined to comment. Uber lawyers said in letters to Portland authorities, which Portland made public in a report last week, that the Greyball technology was used \"exceedingly sparingly\" in that city, before the service was approved there in 2015. The nature of any potential federal criminal violation, and the likelihood of anyone being charged, is unclear. The investigation is still in its early stages, the sources said. Bloomberg news service reported the existence of a federal probe last week, but did not identify it as criminal. Uber received a subpoena from a Northern California grand jury seeking documents concerning how the software tool functioned and where it was deployed, one person familiar with the request said. That indicates a criminal investigation is underway. The second source confirmed that was the case. A subpoena from a grand jury is a formal request for documents or testimony concerning a potential crime. It does not, in itself, indicate wrongdoing or mean charges will be brought. The ride services company's board has retained an outside law firm, Shearman & Sterling LLP, to conduct its own internal investigation into what transpired, those two sources and a third said. A Shearman spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment. Uber, a venture capital-backed firm most recently valued at $68 billion, has long had a reputation as an aggressive startup. It has been battered with multiple controversies over the last few months that have raised questions about Chief Executive Travis Kalanick and led him to say he needed \"leadership help.\" The technology at issue in the criminal probe helped Uber tag some users so that they saw a different version of its standard app, the company said in a blog post in March. Uber said Greyball obscured the real location of Uber cars in various circumstances, including the possibility of physical threats or merely to test new features. The program was part of a broader Uber system, called Violation of Terms of Service, that analyzed credit card, device identification, location data and other factors to predict whether a request for a ride was legitimate, current and former employees said. The technology was used partly to prevent fraud and protect drivers from harm, the company blog post said. If a ride request was deemed illegitimate, Uber's app showed bogus information and the requester would not be picked up, the employees told Reuters. However, the Greyball technique was also used against suspected local officials who could have been looking to fine drivers, impound cars or otherwise prevent Uber from operating, the employees said. The system might have gone farther than suggested by Uber's terms of service for app users. For example, it mined credit card information to see if the owner was affiliated with a credit union used by police and checked social media profiles to assess the likelihood that the person was in law enforcement. After the Times exposed the program in March, regulators who had been unable to catch Uber in places where it was banned accused the company of obstructing their inquiries. Transportation officials in Portland investigated and reported last week that Uber had used Greyball to evade 16 Portland Bureau of Transportation officials, denying them dozens of rides, in December 2014 before Uber was authorized to operate there. The city said it found no evidence that the behavior was repeated when Uber re-entered the market in April 2015. Uber said it used the Greyball technology in December 2014, while it was operating without approval, because it was \"deeply concerned that its driver-partners would be penalized financially\" or otherwise for their driving.

      "content": "DeepMap, a new mapping startup for the fledgling autonomous vehicle industry, has raised $25 million in a series A round led by Accel, with participation from existing seed-stage investors Andreessen Horowitz and GSR Ventures, which had previously invested around $7 million in the company. Not a great deal was known about DeepMap prior to now, but the Palo Alto-based company, which was founded early last year, has a number of notable people at the helm, including CEO James Wu, who previously worked at Google, Apple, and Baidu on mapping products; CTO Mark Wheeler, who also worked at Google as a software engineer and Apple as a senior scientist; and COO Wei Luo, who previously served as product manager across a number of Google projects, including Maps and Earth. Put simply, DeepMap has some experienced and knowledgeable people leading its push into the self-driving car realm. DeepMap's underlying technology helps automotive firms get up to speed, so to speak, in terms of bringing autonomous cars onto roads around the world. DeepMap provides the software that gives them accurate high-definition mapping and real-time localization, as well as the necessary infrastructure to support the rolling out of the technology to cars at scale. In effect, DeepMap serves as the eyes and the brain needed to make cars autonomous; it maps the environment, tells the vehicle where it is in relation to the environment, and shares this information with other vehicles on the DeepMap platform. There are a growing number of players working to power the self-driving car revolution. Mobileye is a computer vision firm specializing in autonomous cars too, and it was recently snapped up by Intel for $15.3 billion. Last year, General Motors (GM) snapped up Cruise Automation for more than $1 billion, while Ford recently committed to buying a majority stake in a similar startup called Argo AI for $1 billion. Other players in the field include Civil Maps and TetraVue, which have both raised venture capital investment over the past year. The problem these companies are trying to solve is this: For cars to maneuver through traffic and hazardous conditions at high speeds, they must be aware of the conditions around them -- and given the speeds at which they're traveling, there isn't a great deal of time to \"think.\" This is why quality maps and cameras capable of processing detailed imagery at speed and distances is key if the self-driving car industry is to reach its full potential -- just as humans need to use their eyes, ears, and brains to navigate roads, so do cars. \"Our goal is to help make self-driving cars and trucks drive safely and make them a reality as quickly as possible,\" explained Wu. \"The societal implications of integrating self-driving vehicles into the transportation ecosystem are considerable -- from more independence for the elderly, the young, and the handicapped to saving many lives and making commuting a more meaningful use of time. But to get there, we need precise mapping and localization technology that is purpose-built from the ground up and ensures the highest possible safety, performance, and operating efficiency. Solving this challenge to a point where it's safely deployable in the real world is very hard, time-consuming, and expensive.\" For fully autonomous cars to be realized, the automotive and technology industries must converge, and this is why we're seeing more partnerships come to the fore, either through acquisitions, investments, or simply collaborations. With a total of $32 million raised since its inception, DeepMap said that it now plans to \"optimize\" its HD mapping and localization platform and double down on its efforts to hire top technical mapping talent.

      "content": "SAN FRANCISCO & TEL AVIV, Israel-(BUSINESS WIRE)-May 4, 2017-  YL       Ventures, the premier seed stage venture capital firm headquartered       in Silicon Valley while investing in Israel, today announced it has       closed its third fund, YLV III. The new fund builds on the success of       its two prior funds, both of which generated returns in the top quartile       of all North American Venture Capital funds, according to Preqin.           YLV III was significantly over-subscribed with nearly 100 percent of       existing YLV II investors participating, and closed on $75 million, 25       percent above its target of $60 million. The fund will invest in seed       stage Israeli companies in high-growth sectors including cybersecurity,       enterprise software, autonomous vehicles, drone technologies and VR/AR. 1        YLV III aims to invest in two to three companies per year. Initial seed       investments will be $2-3 million, with YL Ventures leading the rounds. A       large portion of the fund is reserved to participate in U.S. VC-led       follow-on rounds of its portfolio companies.           Heading the new fund is Silicon Valley-based Managing Partner Yoav       Andrew Leitersdorf, a serial entrepreneur and early stage investor for       25 years who founded the firm in 2007. Rounding out the team is Ofer       Schreiber, partner, leading the Israeli office; Iren Reznikov, senior       analyst, and Sharon Seemann, marketing director. YL Ventures is       currently recruiting additional investment professionals to join its       Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv offices.           Leitersdorf attributes the heightened interest in YLV III to soaring       cybersecurity spending, expected to exceed $202 billion in 2021,       according to Markets&Markets, and the deep domain expertise and       experience in cybersecurity that Israeli entrepreneurs possess, most of       who graduated from the IDF's intelligence units.           \"For YL Ventures, this convergence represents an opportunity to address       evolving security risks and leverage Israel's unique talent pool to meet       mounting global demand for the most effective solutions,\" said       Leitersdorf.           \"Israel is a well-known powerhouse for cybersecurity and related       technological innovation. We are able to harness that expertise to       expand into new sectors that leverage artificial intelligence, machine       learning, computer vision, big data and robotics, all of which are       highly relevant to our new fund. While remaining extremely selective, we       can vet ideas fast, devote substantial attention to helping our       companies scale, and provide a lot of value post-investment.\"           YL Ventures is also expanding its leadership team with the addition of a       number of high-caliber and experienced venture advisors. Justin Somaini,       chief security officer at SAP, is the first of these. A prominent       security industry angel investor, board member and advisor to many       security startups, Somaini said he is eager to deepen his relationship       with YL Ventures and assist early-stage cybersecurity startups coming       out of Israel to scale their businesses globally.           \"I've been collaborating with YL Ventures for some years now and know       they have unparalleled access to Israeli cybersecurity talent and       innovation,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward with great anticipation to       working more closely with the entrepreneurs the fund selects to help       them bring the next wave of technological innovation to market.\"           Based in both Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, the firm has early       and deep access to the Israeli entrepreneurial ecosystem as well as       an active presence and strong network in the U.S.           \"Out of the hundreds of startup ideas we evaluate every year, we only       invest in the select few we believe are the most brilliant. This enables       us to truly partner with the founders, actively support each company and       give it the full attention it deserves,\" said Schreiber. \"We then       leverage our Silicon Valley presence to create business opportunities       and guide founders through the challenges of penetrating global markets       and building great companies. It's a model that is not easily reproduced       and creates a true win/win for entrepreneurs and investors.\"           This model has yielded a track record of successful exits. The combined       funds, YLV I and II, have invested in 10 companies, five of which have       already been successfully acquired. Most recently, FireLayers (cloud       access security broker) was acquired by Proofpoint, and BlazeMeter       (performance testing platform for DevOps) was acquired by CA.           Among the current YL Ventures portfolio companies: Twistlock,       (virtual container security), which last week announced       a $17 million Series B funding round; Karamba       Security (Autonomous Security for autonomous and connected cars);       and Hexadite       (security orchestration and automation).           Yair Grindlinger, FireLayers co-founder and now vice president of       Information Protection Products at Proofpoint, said, \"YL Ventures was       not just an investor, they were an integral part of our team and       essential to our successful exit. YLV's entire model is built around       helping entrepreneurs. They commit time and resources and continue to       back the companies over the long-term.\"      Resources:YL       Ventures Portfolio CompaniesVideos:YL       Ventures \"Our Story\"Portfolio       TestimonialsBlogs:Trends       in Israel's Cybersecurity InvestmentsIsraeli       Startups Deliver Much Needed Tech for Self-driving CarsThe       Drone Race is off and RunningExits:The       Story of FireLayers, From a Shabby Steakhouse in Netanya to a $55       Million Exit to ProofpointThe       Inside Story of BlazeMeter, from First VC Meeting to Exit   Tweet This: .@YLVentures closes $75M fund for seed stage Israeli       entrepreneurs #cybersecurity #drones #AI #autonomouscars http://bit.ly/2pik3ya   About YL Ventures        YL Ventures is a seed-stage venture capital firm that invests in       cybersecurity, enterprise software, autonomous vehicles, drone       technologies and VR/AR companies, with particular focus on the Israeli       market.

The San Francisco-based startup announced today that it has secured an additional $27 million in a round co-led by Menlo Ventures and New Enterprise Associates (NEA). Existing investors Initialized Capital and Pear VC also joined. Customers incorporate a snippet of code on their website that automatically captures every user interaction, including clicks, taps, gestures, form submissions, and page views. The story behind Heap echoes that of many other Silicon Valley startups. Founders Matin Movassate and Ravi Parikh studied computer science at Stanford, then, in 2013, they joined Y Combinator's Winter 2013 batch, where they founded Heap, which has since collected a total of $40 million. The startup currently has 45 employees. Movassate, who is the CEO, claims Heap has more than 6,000 customers, including Casper, Lending Club, The Atlantic, Twilio, and Zendesk. The startup offers two pricing tiers -- a free one for growing teams and a custom pricing option for the entire company. When asked whether Heap uses artificial intelligence (AI), Movassate replied: \"Not yet. We think the first step to building useful AI is...collecting a massive dataset.\" With increasing automation and the implementation of simpler analytics tools, the role of engineers is taking a new turn. \"Now their time is freed up to do interesting work, not set up analytics plumbing for others,\" said Movassate. \"Many of our biggest users and advocates are engineers.\" Movassate claims to be largely winning business from Adobe Analytics (Omniture), Mixpanel, and Google Analytics.

      "content": "Fastdata.io, a real-time stream processing company, said today it has raised $1.5 million from Nvidia and other investors. The startup was built on the idea that its stream processing software engine could use graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate just about any kind of real-time data processing. And it can accelerate real-time streams at about three orders of magnitude faster than current competing stream engines, such as Apache Spark. Santa Monica, Calif.-based Fastdata.io will use the financing to invest in developing the company's product, marketing, and talent acquisition. The company's leader is CEO Alen Capalik, who has expertise directing low-level kernel development for high-frequency trading financial systems and advanced cybersecurity technology. \"I've had to do real-time processing for security and high-frequency trading in my past life, and I was always underwhelmed,\" Capalik said in an interview. \"But when Nvidia came out with CUDA, exposing GPUs for a different kind of processing, that was an 'aha' moment for me. We are developing software that can accelerate all the real-time workloads.\" \"[Security is] a huge problem,\" Capalik said. \"If you have hackers, you have to know what is happening in real time.\" He said that the company can accelerate real-time stream processing at 2.5 to 3 times faster than rival Spark. Fastdata.io has developed high-performance computing (HPC) software, called FDIO Engine, which exploits the massively parallel processing capability of GPUs to provide economical, real-time, inline processing of big data in motion. Capalik said this could really accelerate processing in real time for applications such as finance, fraud, security, artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, self-driving cars, and the Internet of Things. Jeff Herbst, vice president of business development at Nvidia, said in an interview with VentureBeat, \"We were attracted to this because it's a turbocharged version of what can be done with GPUs. There's a huge amount of data in the world, with more created in the last six months than in the last 1,000 years. A lot of it can't be processed in real time. If they can make this happen, it solves a huge problem in the data-processing ecosystem.\" The software can also reduce power requirements in the data center by more than 90 percent, whether running in the public cloud or on private servers. This new level of efficiency will save billions of dollars in power costs, while tremendously reducing carbon emissions for cloud providers, the company said. Fastdata.io will exhibit at the GPU Technology Conference on May 8-11, 2017, in San Jose, Calif. The company was started in 2016 and has 10 employees. It will launch a private beta this summer and a public beta later in the year. Nvidia has also invested in other companies that are tackling a piece of the task, like MapD and Datalogue. And Nvidia has stepped up its investment in AI startups in the past year. \"We are circling the problem from so many angles now, with artificial intelligence and GPUs being used to solve big problems,\" Herbst said.

Abundant Robotics wants to help agricultural growers shoulder this task and today announced funding of $10 million, led by GV, to commercialize its apple-picking robot. Apple growers generate about $50 billion in revenue globally, yet the apple picking process hasn't undergone any significant change in the last 100 years, says Abundant Robotic's cofounder and CEO, Dan Steere. \"Today, agricultural workers pick apples wearing a bag with shoulder straps that can weigh between 45 to 60 pounds,\" he told VentureBeat in an interview. \"And the labor pool of folks that are willing to do this work is shrinking.\" Enter the apple-picking robot. The initial idea sprang out of SRI International, which provided research funding alongside the Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission. Abundant Robotics spun out of SRI in 2016 to begin working on the final prototype. The robot uses computer vision to recognize ripe apples and a vacuum system to pick them -- its arms can reach the top of a tree. \"Modern apple orchards use dwarf trees, which are supported by trellis structures that range from 10 to 14 feet tall,\" said Steere. Agriculture workers will manage the robot remotely to pick the apples. Steer claims that although there is a lot of research interest in agricultural automation, Abundant Robotics is currently the only startup tackling this issue on a commercial level. Israel-based FFRobotics, however, is also working on a patented robotic fruit harvester. Broader agricultural automation includes Bosch's weed-killing robot. New investors BayWa AG and Tellus Partners joined GV in today's round. Existing investors Yamaha Motor Company, KPCB Edge, and Comet Labs also participated. Abundant Robotics will use the new capital to commercialize the technology and is targeting next year for the release. Steere would not disclose the price at this point. The startup targets the U.S. market and plans on applying the technology to other fruit-picking industries in the future. Based in Hayward, California, Abundant Robotics currently has eight employees. ",

Founded out of Palo Alto, Calif. in 2016, Next Insurance is the latest in a long line of insurance tech startups to garner VC funding, with the likes of New York-based Lemonade raising one of Sequoia's largest-ever seed rounds back in 2015, while Insurify recently closed a $4.6 million round for its auto insurance comparison bot, and last month Trov closed a $45 million round. Notably, German insurance giant Munich Re also led that round of funding through its HSB Ventures offshoot. Unlike fledgling insurance companies such as Lemonade, which is licensed to issue its own policies, Next Insurance partners with existing insurance providers to actually issue the policies, with Next focusing on packaging the policies within its technology platform. Next Insurance says that it creates a \"direct link\" with targeted small business owners and focuses on specific industries, such as \"yoga insurance,\" \"landscaper insurance,\" and \"janitorial insurance.\" Indeed, Next Insurance actually partnered with Munich Re back in December to launch an insurance product that targets commercial photographers. \"The small business sector is vast and extremely varied, yet the small business insurance market is digitally underserved,\" explained Next CEO and cofounder Guy Goldstein. \"This is especially true for independent business owners like photographers and personal trainers that we're already serving. Next's platform is able to overcome significant challenges by simplifying and expediting the insurance sign up and engagement process for the small business owner and channeling advanced data analytics to create policies that are tailored to the unique needs of different classes of business.\" Today's news comes a little more than a year after Next raised a $13 million seed round of funding ahead of its official launch. And with an additional $29 million in the bank, it says it will now double down on building out its insurance products and expanding into new sectors. ",

      "content": "(Reuters) -- Uber Technologies Inc goes before a U.S. judge on Wednesday to fight for the right to continue work on its self-driving car program, the latest phase in a courtroom battle over trade secrets that threatens to topple a central pillar of Uber's growth strategy. The ride-services company is contesting a lawsuit by Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit, Waymo, which accused former Waymo engineer and current Uber executive Anthony Levandowski of taking technical secrets from Waymo and using them to help Uber's self-driving car development. If it were proven that Levandowski and Uber conspired in taking the information, that could have dire consequences for Uber, say legal and ride-hailing industry experts. Uber's $68 billion valuation is propped up in part by investors' belief it will be a dominant player in the emerging business of self-driving cars. At issue on Wednesday is Waymo's demand that U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup in San Francisco issue an injunction barring Uber from using any of the technology that Waymo said was stolen. If Alsup issues a broadly worded order against Uber, it could all but shut down Uber's self-driving car program while court proceedings continue. Alsup is not expected to rule immediately on Wednesday, but he may intimate which way he is leaning. At a hearing last month, Alsup warned Uber that it may face an injunction, saying of the evidence amassed by Waymo: \"I've never seen a record this strong in 42 years.\" Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick has said that autonomous vehicles, though still in their infancy, are critical to the company's long-term success and future growth. Indeed, autonomous cars promise to change the economics of the ride-hailing business. Among Uber's biggest expenses is the cost of attracting drivers, who have a high turnover rate. And Uber's ability to expand into suburban and rural markets, and areas with low vehicle ownership, and continue to offer a ride within three minutes, largely hinges on the availability of a network of self-driving vehicles. \"This is central to Uber,\" said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University and author of the book \"The Sharing Economy,\" noting that Uber has more at stake than some of its rivals. \"If Google can't launch their self-driving car for 10 years instead of five, this will be a little blip in Google's multibillion-dollar revenue. Uber is the one that really depends on it.\" Uber has faced a string of setbacks in recent months, including allegations of sexual harassment from a former employee and the public release of a video of Kalanick berating an Uber driver. The company, though still growing strongly, is losing hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter, according to information the company released last month. \"Any big setback here would likely hit its valuation hard,\" said Jan Dawson, an Uber analyst with Jackdaw Research. A blanket ban on Uber's autonomous efforts \"would certainly stall its efforts for a while and put it even further behind Waymo and others.\" Uber has self-driving tests underway in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Arizona. It started work on the technology six years after Google began. Other industry watchers say that Uber, which has deep pockets and other value propositions such as huge swaths of traffic and rider data, could ride out a negative ruling in the Waymo case. The Waymo lawsuit, filed in February, revolves around a laser-based technology called Lidar that allows cars to \"see\" their surroundings and detect the location of other cars and pedestrians. Waymo said Levandowski, who until last week was head of Uber's self-driving car program, stole more than 14,000 confidential documents before leaving his job at Waymo in January 2016. He formed a self-driving truck startup, Otto, which Uber bought in August for $680 million. Uber has said Waymo's claims are false, and in a court filing called the preliminary injunction motion \"a misfire.\" Uber has not denied Levandowski took files from Waymo, but said it never possessed any of the confidential information that Waymo accused Levandowski of stealing. Levandowski himself has invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination because of the possibility of a future criminal probe. And last week, Levandowski said in an email to Uber employees he would stay at Uber but was stepping down from his work on Lidar. \"You're left to assume the worst,\" said Elizabeth Rowe, an intellectual property professor at University of Florida Levin College of Law. In a deposition of Levandowski last month, attorneys for Waymo also probed Levandowski about Kalanick, whether the CEO encouraged him to take Waymo's confidential material, according to a court transcript. Levandowski invoked the Fifth Amendment. A spokesman for Uber declined to comment on the deposition.

      "content": "Agolo, a New York-based startup that's setting out to help companies fight information overload through AI-powered summarizations, has closed a $3.5 million seed round of funding co-led by Microsoft's corporate investment fund, Microsoft Ventures, and CRV, with participation from Point72 Ventures and Franklin Templeton. Founded in 2012, Agolo in its original guise was all about helping users curate their Twitter feed to focus on tweets and conversations that were most relevant to their preferences. But that early beta, it seems, was more of a proof of concept, showing how it's possible to crunch vast swathes of information to zoom in on the data that matters most. And so today Agolo is pitched as the \"world's most advanced summarization software,\" connecting news, documents, data, and more to create real-time summaries more quickly. Above: Summarization Example Using natural language processing (NLP), Agolo's technology analyzes content, identifies different subjects, and draws connections between them. The company said that it already works with \"the world's largest media companies\" to help them summarize their news on Facebook and through Amazon's Alexa voice assistant. \"Summarization is essentially algorithmic reading and writing of content, which is as much a pillar of artificial intelligence as it is of human intelligence,\" said Sage Wohns, CEO and cofounder of Agolo. \"There's a crucial need for making sense of the world's information and Agolo is filling that void. Our platform partnerships with our investors have helped us become indispensable to media companies -- it's hard to find a media company we don't work with. And there are broader applications in diverse sectors, including financial services.\" Algorithms and AI are increasingly infiltrating the creative realm. Companies similar to Agolo include Automated Insights, which is using automation to analyze big data and transform it into stories, like sports reporting, while Narrative Science focuses on business intelligence for the enterprise, or \"data storytelling,\" as it puts it, enabling automated earnings reports created from data. Agolo has raised a number of smaller seed rounds of funding before now, but with its latest cash injection the company said it now plans to \"transform the way financial service analysts do their jobs\" by expanding its platform to cater to asset managers and investment banks. \"This is game-changing for those whose livelihoods depend on data accuracy and speed to action to make high stakes decisions,\" continued Mohamed AlTantawy, CTO and cofounder of Agolo. \"Defeating information overload creates a serious advantage for long/short equity analysts. End users receive personalized market and business intelligence reports so they don't have to spend countless hours reading through the same information.\" Moving forward, Agolo noted that it plans to integrate its summarization smarts into additional platforms, such as Slack, as well as chat, voice, and video. Microsoft Ventures' involvement in this funding round is also a major coup for Agolo, and comes just five months after it set up a new AI-focused fund, which made its inaugural investment in Montreal-based Element AI, while just yesterday Microsoft Ventures joined a $7.6 million round into AI startup Bonsai. It's worth noting here, however, that the Agolo investment came from Microsoft Ventures' main pot, not the AI-focused fund. \"The ability for humans to process mass amounts of information quickly is extremely limited, making summarization key to digesting data efficiently,\" noted Nagraj Kashyap, corporate vice president at Microsoft Ventures. \"We're excited to continue working with Agolo in its quest to fight information overload with AI, ultimately helping to make people and organizations more productive.\"     ",

      "content": "L'Oreal has launched a bot named Beauty Gifter that asks both the gift giver and the recipient questions in order to sell personalized makeup and skin care gifts via Facebook Messenger. The bot was first made available in a soft launch last week. Beauty Gifter is one in a series of conversational experiences L'Oreal plans to create together with Automat Technologies, a Montreal-based startup that has operated primarily in stealth since its launch last year. Upcoming initiatives could include the use of in-store QR codes to promote conversational experiences, Automat CEO Andy Mauro told VentureBeat in a phone interview. \"There's a lot that can be done with that capability, and what I would say is stay tuned for where we're going to go with that, because that's a big part of where we're headed,\" Mauro said. With the debut of Messenger Platform 2.0 last month at Facebook developer conference F8, the Messenger camera is now able to scan QR codes. Recent changes to Facebook Messenger mean QR codes can be linked not just to a bot or profile, as was the case before, but to a broader range of destinations including a specific conversational experiences within a bot, like someone who wants to look for a gift as opposed to someone who can jump directly to sales. Beauty Gifter begins by asking the price range of the gift giver and age range of the recipient. Then the gift giver sends a card to the recipient that says, \"I want to buy you a gift.\" The bot then asks the gift receiver a series of questions about their skin tone and type, what color combinations they prefer, and whether dry or oily skin are concerns. Once questions are finished, the bot then sends a series of gift options to the gift giver. According to Mauro, asking the gift receiver what they want doesn't spoil the surprise because L'Oreal owns dozens of brands, from The Body Shop to Giorgio Armani. \"There's a whole bunch of crappy gift bots out there right now, and they mostly ask the gift giver to answer those questions. Well, the gift giver doesn't normally know the answer to those questions, but the gift receiver does,\" he said. \"A lot of people say, 'Hey, it will spoil the surprise'; we've actually found most people don't care about that. It doesn't really spoil the surprise since like a dozen L'oreal brands are a part of this.\" Both L'Oreal and Automat were mentioned onstage at F8 last week during the keynote speech from Messenger VP David Marcus as examples of innovative bots being made on the Messenger Platform. Marcus referred to Automat as one of a handful of companies that play crucial roles in the early Messenger bot ecosystem. Also mentioned at various times during the annual Facebook developer conference were Messenger Platform 2.0 were Epytom Stylist, a fashion recommendation bot, and a Sephora makeover appointment scheduler bot, two bots that also help with beauty and fashion tips. In another sign of the rush to combine fashion, bots, and ecommerce, last week Amazon launched its Echo Look, which combines Alexa and computer vision to help people pick outfits. Marketing and sales are due to play a large role in the future of the Messenger platform. Last month in an interview with Recode prior to F8, Marcus said Messenger's business model is centered on advertising, while earlier this year Messenger began testing advertisements on Messenger. Mauro thinks conversational marketing could give people an experience more like what you'd find in a store and reshape the business-customer relationship as brands begin to have more direct conversations with customers. L'Oreal also recently committed to \"establishing a new center of excellence for AI in Montreal.\" Montreal is a city increasingly associated with the growing AI industry. In recent months companies like Microsoft and Google have also made investments in AI centers in Montreal. Last fall Google opened an AI lab in Montreal and announced plans to grow a team there to beef up its representation in the city's deep learning community, while Microsoft doubled the size of its AI presence in Montreal earlier this year. Beauty Gifter will initially be available for sales in Canada only, though L'Oreal may deploy the bot in additional markets like the United Kingdom in 2018, Mauro said. Up until now, Automat has mostly run in stealth mode, but Mauro told VentureBeat his startup is beginning to gel around what it believes is the biggest opportunity in the age of bots on chat apps like Messenger: conversational marketing that delivers direct sales or a salesperson-like experience over digital channels. In some of its initial projects, Automat also created a Kalani Hilliker bot for fashion advice on Kik and a bot to educate people about the dangers of digging in your yard without identifying things like gas or water lines for California 811. \"I know we've been very quiet, very stealthy at Automat,\" Mauro said. \"It's very clear to me the biggest aspect of messaging and chatbots is going to be conversational marketing, more so than things like customer service and other aspects of it.\" \"Ecommerce in the last 25 years has built web and mobile storefronts that are just devoid of people, and I think conversational marketing is going to start populating those digital storefronts,\" he said.

      "content": "Skillz is taking mobile esports to a new milestone, announcing today that its revenue run-rate has doubled in the past eight months to more than $100 million. The San Francisco startup provides a platform to turn any mobile game on iOS and Android into a game you can play with friends or strangers for cash, prizes, or points. And it enables esports tournaments for games that integrate the Skillz platform. It took skills more than 36 months to generate its first $50 million annual run rate, and it took just eight to bring in the additional $50 million. That shows how fast the platform is growing. In the first quarter, the company had 3 million new users and higher player engagement, said Andrew Paradise, CEO of Skillz, in an interview with GamesBeat. (Paradise is speaking on an esports panel today at GamesBeat Summit 2017). \"The technology and concept of esports on mobile devices is shifting in the market,\" said Paradise. \"Mobile gaming keeps growing at crazy rates. It is now half of the total gaming market, but it was less than a fifth in 2012 when we started.\" Skillz reported revenue of $54 million in 2016, up 170 percent from $20 million in 2015. The esports economy will grow 41.3 percent to $696 million in 2017, according to market researcher Newzoo. The total market is expected to nearly triple to $1.5 billion by 2020. \"Every six months or so, the projections are growing,\" Paradise said. \"The speed with which esports is growing in mind-blowing.\" In 2014, Skillz awarded 8 percent of all esports prizes, with that figure increasing to over 21 percent in 2015. After initially projecting that the company would account for over 30 percent in 2016, Skillz exceeded expectations, finishing the year at over 46 percent of all esports prizes. Above: Let's go bowling with Skillz! Skillz wants to bring esports to the mass market by expanding the category beyond an audience that is currently 85 percent male, according to SuperData Research. Since June 2016, the Skillz user base has grown by more than 32 percent to 11.9 million. While acquiring almost 3 million additional players, Skillz also increased its number of female players from 49 percent of the company's user base in June 2016 to 53 percent today. This marks the first time that the majority of the Skillz user base has been female. The company has also seen its average player spend an increasing number of minutes competing in mobile esports tournaments on the Skillz platform. In June 2016, Skillz said its average player competed for over 50 minutes per day. By October 2016, that average increased to 58 minutes a day. As of March, engagement increased again to over 61 minutes a day, a gain of over 5 percent, which pushes Skillz past the coveted one-hour daily engagement mark. By comparison, people spend 40 minutes a day on YouTube, 35 minutes a day on Facebook and 25 minutes a day on Snapchat. \"You see more casual games adding esports,\" said Paradise. \"People compete in higher levels, and they are spectated. It's like the birth of television or the NFL launching in 1919. You see some of the same kind of changes in content.\" One of the customers is Tether Studios, a two-person studio that had trouble getting organic growth for its Solitaire Cube game. The company had incorporated ads, but it had disappointing results of average revenue per daily active user (ARPDAU) at 2 cents. Then Tether integrated the Skillz platform into the game so that players could compete head-to-head in competitions for prizes. Each player has five minutes to solve a solitaire puzzles, and the winner gets bragging rights on leaderboards. Above: Skillz The result was a big boost in retention. The percentage of players who came back after the first day was 64 percent. It was 50 percent at day seven, and 33 percent after 30 days. The number of daily active users increased, and, with hundreds of cash tournaments running daily, the ARPDAU rose to 45 cents, or 20 times better. \"With the Skillz platform, we were easily able to add a competitive spin to Solitaire Cube that, in turn, increased our monetization and provided an ad-free experience for our users,\" said Tim and Ether O'Neil of Tether Studios. Another customer is Game Masons, which made the game Mini Golf Stars. Game Masons had a hard time getting players to come back. It partnered with Skillz to add tournaments and leaderboards. Not only was Game Masons able to increase ARPDAU, retention, and new installations, it said day seven retention is 27 percent, and ARPDAU is 40 cents, up 1,400 percent from before Skillz. Before it added Skillz, the Mini Golf Stars! Retro Golf Game ranked No. 136 among all U.S. sports apps. After the Skillz integration, the game reached rank No. 12 at its highest. Skillz provides the esports platform for more than 3,000 game studios. The company was founded in 2012, and it has 68 employees. Its investors include the owners of the New England Patriots, Milwaukee Bucks and New York Mets. \"The Skillz platform has increased the depth of Mini Golf Stars, and the leaderboards and player matching have been instrumental for my players,\" said Matt Fossati, CEO of Game Masons.

      "content": "French voters will return to the ballot box this Sunday to choose a new president in a second round of voting that will pit far-right Marine Le Pen against centrist Emmanuel Macron. Polls have shown Macron with a pretty steady 60 percent lead over Le Pen since the first round of voting made them the two finalists. While the campaign has been heated, and will likely remain so this week, Macron seems like a good bet to win. This means that Silicon Valley is likely to have a big fan in the next president of France. Macron is a former investment banker who served for about three years as Economics Minister under the current government. Before taking that gig, he took a monthlong holiday in California, much of it in Silicon Valley, where he met with local business and government leaders to discuss innovation. From the begining of his term as Economic Minister in 2014, he made support for entrepreneurship a clear centerpiece of his agenda. The first time I saw him was at Le Web in 2014. He had just replaced the previous Economics Minister, a man who had caused a stir when he blocked the acquisition of France's Dailymotion by Yahoo. The feeling previously had been that protectionism was the best way to create jobs in France. But speaking at Le Web, Macron made it clear that he would have decided differently, and that allowing exits was critical to entrepreneurs and investors.  He also spent a fair bit of time discussing the need to embrace disruption, to embrace change and the future, rather than setting up barriers to resist it. \"To be clear about the French momentum, we are accelerating,\" he said on stage at the Le Web conference in December 2014. \"They key question for us is how to accelerate, and how to help create new businesses. ... My job is to be sure that in the coming years we create thousands of new businesses to replace the old ones. ... My job is to protect people and allow them to be innovative and take risks.\" Macron became a big supporter of La French Tech, the program previously set in place to encourage and support startups and entrepreneurs in France. In 2015 and 2016, he accompanied delegations of French startups to the Consumer Electronics Show to promote their prospects, and to demonstrate the change in attitude he argued was happening across France. Following the 2016 CES, he travelled to San Francisco to meet French entrepreneurs there, and then stopped for meetings at Apple and Google. \"There is a cultural revolution in progress, that of the entrepreneurial force in France that the country needs,\" he told French entrepreneurs in San Francisco. He said he wanted to change the culture in France, where there is a great fear of failing, but also a suspicion of people who want to be too successful: \"That leaves little room to maneuver.\" Indeed, Macron has built his campaign like a startup. He hired a political technology firm last year to help him research and interview thousands of French citizens to learn about their hopes and fears. Using his website, mobile apps, big data, and data visualization tools, he created En Marche!, an independent political movement that offered a new centrist philosophy. Macron embraced trade, disruption, the European Union, immigration, and the need to support entrepreneurs with new programs. He has emerged as the clear favorite of France's startup set. That platform also saw him finish first among 11 candidates in the first round of voting last month. With Macron in charge, Silicon Valley can expect a sympathetic ear, but not necessarily one that will accede to its every wish. In the past, for instance, Macron has supported Uber's right to operate in France. But he has also been insistent that companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Google pay their fair share of taxes. That said, under Macron Silicon Valley can likely expect a warmer welcome than it has ever experienced in France. The question for France's economy is whether that will encourage more U.S. tech firms and investors to plant a flag in Paris and give the country's start ecosystem another shot of adrenaline. ",

Today, the firm promoted its entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) and former DataHero cofounder Chris Neumann to venture partner, where he'll be tasked with finding worthwhile investments. In addition, 500 Startups has launched a data track to provide specialized advice and resources to big data startups that are part of the firm's accelerator program. Neumann first joined 500 Startups in February as an EIR. He told VentureBeat then that his goal was to help companies with \"a heavy focus or influence of data on technology\" bring their product to market and sell it to customers, particularly those who may not have day jobs as data scientists. Traditional venture capital doesn't work for enterprise data companies, Neumann asserted. \"You bootstrap your company, then raise money, and 18 months later you have a minimum viable product (MVP), and months later you have traction,\" he said. \"But with deep tech companies, building a product takes longer than 18 months. It can be more capital-intensive and can take years.\" In his mind, when it comes to big data, machine learning, or AI startups, investors have to move beyond a one-strategy-fits-all mentality. \"Last year, while exploring what I wanted to do, I talked to a lot of people that were data founders,\" he said in an interview. \"When I had the opportunity to talk to 500 Startups, it was about mentoring, about giving an opportunity to see the value of an accelerator. But what if we did something...not like a general purpose accelerator, but the pieces that people building interesting data companies need.\" With Neumann's elevation to venture partner, he joins a roster of existing partners at 500 Startups -- like Adam Benayoun, Philipp Moehring, James Riney, Matt Lerner, Tristan Pollock, Binh Tran, Cjin Cheng, Monique Woodard, and others. Recognizing that data tech companies may require some extra hand-holding when it comes to growing their business, tapping into their market, and finding customers, 500 Startups is launching a data track, which is similar to the fintech, health, and beauty and fashion tracks previously launched. The firm has enlisted the help of numerous industry experts, such as Keen IO founder Kyle Wild, Sophos vice president of security analytics Raffael Marty, GE Aviation vice president of sales Lee Paries, Amazon AI principal product manager Robert Munro, and Parrable founder Carla Holtze. Neumann is spearheading this program. Startups wishing to participate in the data track must be part of 500 Startups' most recent accelerator batch, which has begun accepting applications. There are no extra costs associated with the program -- think of it as added college elective courses. But Neumann is going to be pretty selective about who it admits and will limit the program to between eight and 10 companies. The lucky ones will be those with deep technology at their core -- it's about the application of data, after all. \"I definitely have a thesis on what's interesting: generally, infrastructure (platforms that will benefit a lot of people), last-mile technology (interesting systems exposing data in unique ways), and vertical-specific business apps that are not just business apps with data, but data is really at the core of what they're doing,\" Neumann stated. Applications for the 500 Startups' 22nd batch and data track are now being accepted. ",

      "content": "At its education event in New York City today, Microsoft announced a new edition of its latest operating system: Windows 10 S. Available on first-party and third-party hardware -- Microsoft will be releasing its own Windows 10 S device and will also let manufacturers sell their own -- Windows 10 S is a streamlined edition of Windows 10 aimed at the education market. Microsoft partners will begin offering PCs running Windows 10 S this summer, starting at $189, and Microsoft will also ship its own Surface Laptop running Windows 10 S, starting at $999, on June 15. The main way that Windows 10 S differs from the other editions is that it can only run apps from the Windows Store. That includes Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps and Win32 apps that Microsoft has accepted into its app store. Not coincidentally, Microsoft is bringing Office to the Windows Store. The goal is to avoid the problems of traditional Win32 apps that often run in the background and push their own updates. Microsoft wants to stop apps from hooking into the boot and sign-in process to handle all their own updates, which in turn slows down startup time. Windows Store can take care of this today, but Windows 10 S makes it the only way to install and update apps. As a result, Microsoft hopes Windows 10 S will be able to offer faster sign-in times (about 15 seconds) and better battery life.  Terry Myerson, executive vice president for Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, demoed Windows 10 S on stage. He showed how users are blocked from installing apps from the web (pictured above); how much faster Windows 10 S sign-in is compared to Windows 10 Pro, which has many apps in the boot process; and how schools can manage hundreds of devices. For example, teachers can preload software using only a USB key. This is still a full version of Windows 10. It's just locked down to only work with apps that Microsoft has approved, similar to how Apple and Google lock down iOS and Android to their respective app stores. Windows 10 S also differs in two other ways. It is cloud-manageable (Windows 10 Home is not, but Pro is) through Microsoft's Intune, Intune for Education, and other modern management systems. It also sets up OneDrive cloud syncing by default, whereas other editions allow the user to skip this step and opt out of using OneDrive. Here's the picture Microsoft is trying to paint for schools. You have a 45-minute class. Your students need to be able to sign in on a device they didn't use yesterday. The login process gets all their content, reliably and quickly. You don't sit there waiting five minutes for your kids to log in. The devices need to last all day (no battery dying in 7th period). Lastly, the devices need to be easy to manage so you can install and update apps effortlessly. For the record, the \"S\" in Windows 10 S does not stand for \"student.\" It refers to Windows being more streamlined and secure and having superior performance. It's the same idea as the Xbox One S -- Windows 10 S is the core essence of Windows. Myerson called it the \"soul\" of today's Windows. The reason Microsoft isn't using the word \"student\" in the name is pretty simple: Although Windows 10 S is clearly aimed at this group, the company doesn't want to pigeon-hole it. Microsoft is hoping non-students buy Windows 10 S devices as well. If they find it inadequate, they can always upgrade. Windows 10 S will be easily upgradeable to Windows 10 Pro via the Windows Store. For educators, the upgrade is free. For end users and businesses, the cost is $49. Schools running earlier Windows Pro editions can move to Windows 10 S for free. This means running a later version of Windows, but they have to be okay with limiting their devices to only Windows Store apps. Windows 10 S is Microsoft's answer to Google's Chrome OS, and even Apple's iPad push in schools. Myerson didn't mention the latter, but he did knock Chromebooks a few times onstage. This will be a fierce battle as tech giants strive to have students taught on their own platforms -- get them young and you could win them over for life. ",

      "content": "Docker, the high-flying startup behind an open-source platform that helps developers build and ship distributed applications, has announced that CEO Ben Golub is stepping aside and will be replaced by Concur cofounder and CEO Steve Singh. Golub, who has served as CEO of Docker since 2013, will remain as a director on Docker's board, while Singh will continue to serve as chairman of the board. Singh has served as an executive at SAP since the company snapped up Concur, a finance and expenses software platform, in an $8 billion deal in 2014. But news emerged last month that he was leaving the company after more than 20 years. With almost $200 million in equity financing, Docker is regarded by many as a potential IPO candidate, so grabbing an executive of Singh's caliber as its new CEO is a major coup. \"Over the past four years, Docker has grown at an incredible rate. We are now seeing widespread traction in the developer community and the enterprise market,\" said Docker founder and CTO Solomon Hykes, in a press release. \"Without Ben, Docker wouldn't be in such an incredible position as a platform and as a company. Under his leadership, we built a world-class team and a huge, diverse community that is rewriting the rules of software development and distribution. Ben built the foundation for an exceptional company, and demand for Docker's product is off the charts. With Steve's unique expertise, we will build an organization capable of delivering on that demand and serving our customers across the globe.\" In short, Golub helped Docker get to where it is today as a leading player in the developer tools realm, while also helping it grow in the enterprise software market. Singh's experience taking Concur from startup to a publicly traded company to part of a bigger corporate giant, in the form of SAP, will surely help take Docker to the next level. \"As companies look to create a new generation of applications and services to bring their business into the global digital economy, many are turning to Docker for dramatic improvements in developer productivity and new operational and capital efficiencies,\" explained Sing. \"I look forward to working with the entire Docker team, as well as the broader Docker community to help usher in the new era of application computing.\" ",

Today the company launched a partner program that replaces the existing independent software vendor (ISV) program with a completely new pricing model, support, and onboarding experience and an additional set of tools. To encourage development, Salesforce has allocated $100 million to incentivizing developers, startups, and ISVs. \"The convergence of [artificial intelligence, Internet of Things], and massive datasets has created incredible new opportunities for developers to move beyond the app and build components, intelligent bots, data streams, and more,\" explained Leyla Seka, Salesforce's executive vice president for its AppExchange. \"The new AppExchange Partner Program empowers the next generation of Salesforce ISVs with a single destination for everything they need to succeed -- the training to create solutions on cutting-edge Salesforce technology and the programs to turn them into businesses with global reach.\" Salesforce launched the AppExchange 11 years ago, and since that time more than 3,000 apps have been added to the marketplace and installed more than 4 million times. But a lot has changed since then -- not only at Salesforce, but also in the startup ecosystem. In order to adapt to this changing landscape, the partner program had to adapt. Here are the changes coming to the AppExchange partner program: \"This is a great moment to double down because there's so much interest in Einstein, Lightning, and Trailhead,\" Seka shared. \"It exemplifies our demonstration of commitment to building the largest ecosystem in the world for the enterprise.\" Moving forward, a big focus will be on Salesforce's $100 million platform fund that's provided through the company's venture arm. Though this isn't the first such investment vehicle Salesforce has created, this one is aimed squarely at building out the ecosystem to address the needs of the enterprise. According to Matt Garratt, a vice president for Salesforce Ventures, developers awarded funds will have to build something that's in strategic alignment with the company and will help \"deliver a much better solution to our customers.\" While Garratt declined to disclose what an average deal size would be, the firm will invest in Series A, B, and C funding stages. Salesforce isn't going to be alone in terms of investing in startups. Garratt said that Salesforce will be working similarly to the way it did with the $50 million Lightning Fund, when the company partnered with Bessemer Venture Partners, Cloud Apps Capital Partners, Emergence Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Salesforce has already allocated more than $350 million for startups, to be spread across four funds. ",

      "content": "Real estate may not be the sexiest industry, technologically speaking, but it sure does generate capital. Brendan Wallace and Brad Greiwe are tackling this sleeping giant by making multi-stage investments in real estate technology through their VC firm, Fifth Wall Ventures. The firm came out of stealth mode today and announced the close of its first fund, worth $212 million. The thirty-something year old managing partners have considerable experience in the sector -- working in the real estate branches of The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs, and UBS and founding startups that include Identified, which was acquired by Workday, and Invitation Homes, which recently exited on the public markets. Both Wallace and Greiwe saw an opportunity in real estate investments, especially after the 2008 crash. \"The world changed,\" said Wallace, in an interview with VentureBeat. \"And we didn't really see any focused VC funds in this sector.\" Enter Fifth Wall Ventures -- the name alludes to the fifth \"disruptive\" wall the firm provides in addition to the four physical walls of a building. Above: Brad Greiwe and Brendan Wallace. founders of Fifth Wall Ventures. Founded in 2016, the Los Angeles-based firm has made seven investments to date, worth $60 million. Deals include b8ta, Clutter, Notarize, and Opendoor. Both Wallace and Greiwe believe their edge lies in their inverse approach to investing. \"Most firms adopt a bottom-up strategy, looking at startups and speculating on their success,\" said Greiwe. \"We use a top-down approach by talking to the largest incumbents in real estate and discussing what technologies they would adopt.\" The founders chose to enlist some real estate owners as limited partners (LPs). These include individuals from CBRE, Equity Residential, Lennar, Macerich, and Prologis. When asked if they are collaborating with any Trump-related businesses, the founders were clear: \"He's not that big of an owner in real estate. We've chosen larger owners of real assets.\" They admit, however, that President Trump's announcement about wanting to spend money rebuilding the U.S.'s physical infrastructure is interesting for them in terms of being able to influence what that infrastructure would look like. With Snapchat's recent success, Los Angeles seems to be welcoming a new wave of startups and VC funds. Wallace argues that not only is there an interesting VC scene taking shape in LA, it's also a strategic hub for real estate. \"Silicon Valley had a near monopoly on innovation 10 years ago,\" said Wallace. \"Today, however, innovation is happening everywhere.\" Fifth Wall Ventures currently has nine employees.

      "content": "Cisco's second acquisition in the new year is another big one. The networking giant said Monday that it plans to pay $610 million for startup Viptela, which sells networking technology that lets companies connect their branch offices to corporate data centers. Viptela, founded in 2012 by former Cisco engineers, has raised nearly $110 million in investment. The startup's $75 million funding round in May 2016 gave it a pre-money valuation of $825 million, according to the investment-tracking site Pitchbook. Cisco's latest deal follows its $3.7 billion acquisition of the high-profile business software company AppDynamics that closed in March. A Cisco spokesperson said that the company expects \"the majority of Viptela employees\" to join Cisco and will \"share more detail in the coming weeks.\" Viptela has almost 120 employees, according to Pitchbook. In January, Praveen Akkiraju, a 19-year Cisco veteran who was the senior vice president of its enterprise-networking group, became Viptela's new CEO. The acquisition comes as Cisco's core switching and routing business has faced declines as more companies forgo buying data center hardware and instead are purchasing computing resources on demand from giants like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. To offset the declines, Cisco has been investing heavily in software through big acquisitions like AppDynamics and its $635 million purchase of security startup OpenDNS in 2015. The acquisition gives Cisco a vendor that sells much of its technology through AWS, which could help it gain more customers that use cloud services instead of buying data center hardware. Nearly 90 percent of Viptela's customers use a version of its networking technology that's delivered through AWS, according a January article by industry trade publication SDX Central. Viptela's competitors include other networking startups like CloudGenix and Affirmed Networks. It's unclear whether Cisco will keep the Viptela name. The Cisco spokesperson said \"it's too early yet to make this decision.\" The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2017. This story originally appeared on Fortune.com. Copyright 2017 ",

      "content": "Twitter may have lost its deal to stream Thursday night NFL games live, but that isn't stopping the social network from doubling down on more video. The company unveiled 16 streaming video partnerships Monday night, led by BuzzFeed, Vox Media, Viacom, the WNBA, and the PGA. The total also included a 24-hour streaming news partnership with Bloomberg Media that Twitter announced earlier in the day. All together, the deals show Twitter's increasing focus on video as it grapples with slow growth with its core service. In the most recent quarter, Twitter had more than 800 hours of live content streamed to over 45 million unique users. For most of the past few years, Twitter's stock price has struggled amid various acquisition rumors that never came to fruition and user growth that still pales in comparison to that of Facebook. But last week, its shares jumped after the company announced its largest quarterly user increase since 2015 while revenue continues to lag. Twitter is hoping that its growing list of video partnerships with high-profile brands--many of which bring exclusive streaming of live events or exclusive original content that will be found only on Twitter--can help it jumpstart growth by gaining a foothold in video. Still, it must convince users who typically use the service for a running stream of short snippets of information to visit for longer form video--from daily programming to live events--in an crowded field. Twitter announced new partnerships with BuzzFeed is for a morning news and current events show, called MorningFeed. (The company said that fast-food chain Wendy's has signed on as a sponsor for the BuzzFeed morning show.) Twitter is also partnering with Vox Media's technology website The Verge on a weekly live streaming program reviewing new tech gadgets, called Circuit Breaker. And, Cheddar, the millennial-focused financial news startup launched by former BuzzFeed president Jon Steinberg, will add an hour-long streaming show called Opening Bell that will air daily at 9 a.m. ET from the New York Stock Exchange to complement Cheddar's Closing Bell show that has aired on Twitter everyday at 3 p.m. ET since last fall. Twitter also announced that an exclusive new partnership with Viacom that will include live streams of award shows such as the MTV Movie & TV Awards as well as the pop culture network's annual Video Music Awards. A new partnership with Live Nation will allow the social network to live-stream exclusive concerts and original content, staring with a May 13 performance by Grammy-winning country music group the Zac Brown Band. Twitter will also have access to live content from exclusive Fashion Week runway shows through a partnership with talent agency IMG's fashion arm, while the A+E Networks-backed production company Propagate Content will launch a live daily primetime show focused on pop culture. Meanwhile, Twitter is adding new sports content in the wake of losing a bidding war to Amazon last month for rights to stream the NFL's Thursday night games. Twitter still has a partnership with the NFL that includes live daily programming with NFL news, highlights, and analysis. Twitter, which signed a deal last year to live-stream NHL and MLB games, said on Monday that it will add a weekly three-hour MLB program that will include live game look-ins and highlights. The social network, which also already streams live content in partnership with the NBA, will now begin live-streaming weekly regular season WNBA games (20 total each season) over the next three seasons. The company also announced an expanded partnership with the PGA Tour that will include more than 70 hours of live competition from 31 professional golf tournaments. And, Twitter will launch a new live show called #Verified in partnership with The Players' Tribune, the digital startup from former baseball star Derek Jeter, as well as a new 24-hour, seven-days-a-week network for live college sports events and highlights, called Stadium. Twitter made the announcements as part of The NewFronts, an annual series of events and presentations from digital media companies featuring pitches aimed at both content makers and advertisers. The social network enlisted a wide range of special guests to help add some star power to Twitter's unveiling. Joining Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and COO Anthony Noto onstage in New York was Adam Silver, commissioner of the NBA, along with Minnesota Timberwolves star and NBA Rookie of the Year (2016) Karl Anthony Towns. NFL star A.J. Green was also in attendance, along with Hollywood producer and former NBC Entertainment co-chair Ben Silverman and Tony Award-winning actress Audra McDonald.

      "content": "Google appears to have launched a voice app to talk to you about its annual I/O developer conference, set to take place May 17-19 at the Shoreline Ampitheatre in Mountain View, California. Unfortunately, the conversation action made by Google for its assistant on the Google Home smart speaker didn't work. Repeated attempts by VentureBeat to speak with the Google I/O 17 action about the I/O keynote speech, the date, and location -- questions the action tells you to ask it on Google Home app -- were met with silence. Around 2 p.m. PT Monday the action was pulled from the Google Home app and could no longer be called upon when speaking with the Google Assistant on Google Home.  Based on news and activity in recent months, a broad range of potential announcements could be made at Google I/O as it relates to the Assistant and the Google Home smart speaker, both of which made their debut at I/O last year. Perhaps Google could release its own smart speaker with computer vision to compete with Alexa's new Echo Look. Or, instead of going for fashion and computer vision, the next-gen Google Home could go for utility and quality. Last month The Information reported from an undisclosed source that the next generation of Google Home speakers could have mesh network Wi-Fi inside. Mesh networks are used to spread a signal evenly throughout a home. Three Google Wifi routers can cover an area of 4,500 square feet, the company said. Placing the Assistant inside the routers or adding mesh routers won't just mean more consistent Wi-Fi, but also more Google Assistant availability and more consistent performance by the Assistant throughout a home, or business, or school. A few weeks ago Google said its Assistant is now able to recognize unique voice signatures and Google accounts for up to six people. Should Google announce an increase in the number of unique voice signatures its Assistant is able to identify, applications for the use of the Assistant may increase in settings outside of the home, like in classrooms or among small businesses, startups, or teams at larger companies. There could also be announcements about the recently released Google Assistant software development kit for the spread of Google Assistant to appliances and devices such as home appliances or motorized wheelchairs. While mesh networks and unique voice signatures and computer vision are all exciting and sexy, there are still some basic additions to the Assistant that could be announced at I/O. For example, Google Assistant is still unable to add an event to a calendar, something Alexa does with ease. Google Assistant could also begin to bring third-party actions to devices beyond Google Home. Millions of smartphones running Marshmallow or Nougat, Android TV, Android Wear, and other devices that have or will soon have Google Assistant do not yet have access to the nearly 200 third-party conversation actions that have been made for things like Kayak flight searches, WikiHow DIY tips, in-home elder care, and interactive games. Third-party voice apps or services are currently only available for Google Home. ",

      "content": "A privacy scandal shook the tech industry last week: Unroll Me - a popular free service to quickly unsubscribe from newsletters - was allegedly selling data to third parties. The free service was exploiting user-granted email access to scrape inboxes for the sole purpose of data mining and reselling value. For example, the service would check for Lyft receipts to sell targeted data to Uber. The ordeal created a massive backlash towards Unroll Me but also raised an obvious question: Is this common practice? Perri Chase, a cofounder of Unroll Me who is no longer affiliated with the service, wrote a lengthy blogpost on Tuesday defending the current CEO. She claims that because the service is free, it HAD to sell data to make money. She insists it's common practice for providers of free services like Gmail and Facebook. The analogy between Unroll Me and Google or Facebook is audacious. Not to say haughty. Facebook and Google are making billions selling ads to targeted audiences. But they don't sell user data. Yes, they collect information about users gathered through emails, social networking habits, and location, and use that to attract advertisers, but the data stays in-house. Unroll Me and its mother company, Slice, on the other hand, were selling raw data to third parties. Large, seemingly data-hungry corporations have been scrutinized for years on the use of collected data. They disclose terms of services several times during the onboarding process, offer privacy settings, and ultimately as you are using the service you receive periodic updates on their policy. Their business model is selling ads, not selling data. Users gave Unroll Me their email credentials to perform a specific task -- remove unwanted email subscriptions. Instead these credentials were exploited to mine and sell users' private data. One user posted on an image on Twitter of disclosures made by Unroll Me during the onboarding process.  It clearly says \"We will never touch your personal stuff\", a claim which seems to be an outright lie. Unroll Me bills itself as a cool, helpful service but functions as invasive spyware. That is neither an industry standard, nor flagrantly misleading users about the privacy of their personal information. Storing data, exploiting data, selling raw data to third parties is the last thing you expect given the statement provided in Unroll Me's onboarding. Jojo Hedaya, current CEO of Unroll Me, says he needs to do a better job on their privacy policy. He shouldn't wait too long to do it. A class action lawsuit against Slice was filed on Wednesday in the Northern California District Court for failing to adequately disclose how the service allegedly harvests valuable data from its users' accounts. The lawsuit accuses Unroll Me and Slice of violating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Stored Communications Act due to a lack of disclosure during the signup process. As we all know in this industry, it's very hard, if not impossible, to recover from such a fiasco. Regardless of the legal verdict, the company has already been found guilty in the eyes of the public. I can't see any good coming from this lawsuit. Perri alleges that Unroll Me isn't doing worse than other providers of free services. I personally refute that line of defense. \"Others\" won't make your problem go away. \"Others\" didn't get caught cheating, and those who did are no longer operating. Simple fact of life. Trust is earned in drops and lost in buckets. Although I admire Perri's courage to stand by the company she founded, I can't accept the explanation that users are fools for not reading the fine print. We don't read fine print. We read the large print. \"We will never touch your personal stuff\" is the one sentence we all read, and it was placed in front of our eyes right above the larger button [ACCEPT] for a reason. Can one bad apple spoil the whole bunch? No. Unroll Me's privacy faux pas does not represent an industry standard. Consumers aren't likely to analyze a company's potential pricing models when signing up for a free service, nor would we want them to. It's a sad day when users have to assume that if a service is free, they can expect their personal information is being mined, stored, and auctioned off the the highest bidder. Perri makes a case that the companies who purchase personal data without regard to its source are at fault. She expressly names Uber for its willingness to pay for any information relating to its competition. Unroll Me and its parent company's blatant blame shifting makes the ordeal doubly distasteful. As service providers, it's increasingly important to align our actions with strong ethics. And as a user, I'm going to be more choosy about what services I allow to access my personal information. Florian Seroussi is cofounder and CEO of email intelligence software startup OMC. Prior to OMC, he cofounded Labotec and Global Roaming. ",

That's one reason big-time education advocates such as Bill Gates are so excited by the possibilities of AI, but it has major implications in the workplace, too. Talla, a Boston-area startup, has created a bot that can do many of the routine tasks normally performed by an HR department, such as distributing surveys, gathering data, and even training employees. Sound far-fetched? Such bots are actually more common than many people might realize: 80 percent of companies currently rely on bot-enabled communication tools like Slack and HipChat. Sure, bots can assume busywork and enable better interoffice communication, but a bot's true power lies in its educational capabilities. For many, this vision of the future might seem like a nightmare in which reliable humans are replaced by annoying chatbots that cause more problems than they solve. However, this pessimism is caught up in antiquated notions of what a bot can be, which are not helped by the chatbots encountered in apps such as Facebook Messenger. In reality, a well-designed, well-implemented bot won't replace employees, but it can empower them. Last spring, Georgia Tech hired a teaching assistant named Jill Watson. Jill helped the professor by answering any questions students had outside of class, and the students loved her, even if she was only available online. There was a reason for that: Jill was actually an advanced chatbot. When students found out at the end of the semester, they were blown away. While an ordinary chatbot won't necessarily pass the Turing test, this example shows just how far chatbots have come and how useful they can be as teachers. Here are three ways messaging bots can improve employee training and development. Good teachers do more than answer questions. They also know how to ask students the right questions, framing those questions in ways designed to pique curiosity about a subject and rewarding students when they excel. A good bot can do the same. When employees enter online training sessions, use bots to pose intriguing questions and place conversations in a context that provokes real enthusiasm. At my company, for example, we use bots to tell riddles to our developers to present a stimulating challenge. After lessons are completed, use bots to reward trainees with fun digital images that serve as virtual badges and hearty congratulations, much like the gold star stickers teachers place on students' tests. To motivate employees to keep learning, use a bot to create a leaderboard, keep a personal tally for each student, and chart everyone's progress. Although the gamification of training might sound silly, it gives employees tangible reinforcement: acknowledgement of a job well done. Recognition has been shown to be an excellent way to drive individual performance, which is why so many personal endeavors -- from physical fitness to email management -- have already been gamified. Continued education is vital for any skilled position, and bots are well-equipped to help employees stay up-to-date on the latest technologies and methodologies in their fields. Design your bots to help employees assess their own weak spots. Approach this from a no-pressure standpoint. It shouldn't be about employees getting certain scores. Instead, design your bots so that when employees are asked a question, they can tell you whether they understand the concept. This way, they're aware of what they need to work on and you know what concepts you need to reinforce as a company. If employees don't know where to start when prompted with a question, program the bot to immediately respond with additional resources. A digital network called OUR Walmart, which is composed of more than 100,000 employees, uses IBM's Watson AI abilities to match employees' questions with existing training materials. Then, have your bot ask the same question a week later to track progress. Employees won't realistically remember every single thing they learned during their initial training; it's how we work as humans. We learn something the first time; then, without repetition, we slowly begin to lose that knowledge. However, if we're reminded within a particular cycle -- and then reminded again within a longer cycle -- we're much more likely to retain it in the long term. Why not use a bot to manage and automate this process? Design your bots to deploy refresher courses periodically during the initial training period and beyond. Computer learning can be up to 50 percent more effective than in-person training because bots allow employees to revisit lessons as many times as they need to -- at their convenience and on their own terms. For example, let's say you want to focus on functional programming practices and JavaScript for 12 weeks. Program your bot to engage those teammates over that time period, working around their schedules and allowing them to repeat tutorials as needed. Properly designed and implemented chatbots can empower employees to become more self-sufficient and skilled at what they do. It's a win-win scenario for employees and management. Chatbots aren't here to frustrate and annoy; they're here to help -- you just have to be willing to let them.

On Monday, he announced that he's working on Humu, a startup designed to help us work better. He's joined by Wayne Crosby, Google's director of engineering who recently resigned. While details are sparse, the company plans on using science, machine learning, and \"a little bit of love\" to improve our jobs. Humu, likely named after the Hawaii state fish Humuhumunukunukuapua'a, could be an extension of Bock's experience from shaping the culture at one of the largest tech companies in the world, and it may also leverage insights shared in his book Work Rules! In a 2015 interview, Bock remarked: \"We've learned a lot over the years about what makes work more meaningful and productive -- we've studied this at Google, reviewed the academic research and listened to companies far away from Silicon Valley doing inspiring things on the people front. I wanted this book to provide insights from all these sources to help others bring more happiness to the workplace, and to help us all find more inspiration and meaning in the work we do.\" Many services have tried to make work fun, but Humu wants to take a different approach, leveraging machine learning and science. How that works exactly remains to be seen, but in a LinkedIn post, Bock wrote about how there should be a way to ensure that employees always have good days at work, and not one where people see it as a job: \"We should be constantly learning and growing, and surrounded by people who are doing the same. We all have good days and bad days, but what would work be like if every day were like our best days? Imagine what we could achieve.\" There's currently no timeline for when Humu will officially launch. ",

      "content": "Until recently, the Vatican hasn't been very involved in the tech community. The matters of the soul and the most innovative products had rarely crossed paths, and Catholics around the world were more inclined to go to mass on Sunday than check their Facebook on any given day. However, in recent years, Pope Francis has made a commitment to bridging the gap between the religion and innovation, as is evident from the Vatican's involvement in events like SXSW. Well, the Vatican is going to be even more tapped into the tech world, as a startup accelerator will be launching within the city limits soon. According to a Medium post from Stephen Forte, the founder of Fresco Capital and brains behind the expectant endeavor, starting an accelerator in the Vatican is about more than just immersing the religious community in tech and innovation. It's about spurring growth in the for-profit, mission-driven sector of the startup world. \"I'm motivated to start a global conversation in the investment community on the value of for profit mission driven companies. As a global citizen with young children, I'm called to respond to His Holiness Pope Francis' challenge,\" Forte wrote. As the head of the Vatican, Pope Francis has made his opinions about social good in the business world more than clear. He believes that the tech giants of the world need to be more committed to making the world a better place, and fighting societal issues like climate change. Forte hopes to face the challenge head on by supporting companies looking to do just that.  The accelerator will focus on developing startups that are committed to bettering the stances of food, water, urban development, human potential, conservation, and finance and industry as it relates to a carbon-neutral economy. The accelerator plans to dole out $100,000 to startups for a 6 to 8 percent equity investment. It will operate in Rome from July 13 to September 9, and it's open to startups that haven't yet raised a Series A funding round. The accelerator program ends with a Demo Day at the Vatican in December. No word on whether Pope Francis will be in attendance or not, but I wouldn't hold your breath.

      "content": "The goal of startup competitions is simple: give smaller startups the attention, opportunity, and maybe even prizes that they would have a hard time finding without a stage to pitch on. They bring together investors, founders, and entrepreneurs to facilitate economic growth and spur innovation in a way that the natural process of business doesn't allow. For that reason, startup competitions need to be inclusive. They need to have an eclectic array of startups participating in the events, a wide range of investors that could change the life of a hopeful founder, and above all, a diverse founder group looking to change the world with their startup. At Tech.Co, our focus on inclusion shines the brightest when it comes to our Startup of the Year competition, which takes place at our annual conference, Innovate! and Celebrate. In addition to providing a supportive environment for startups to get noticed, we're also committed to bringing startups from around the world from all walks of life together to compete for prizes that could bring their company the success they're looking for. \"Tech.Co's Startup of the Year Competition takes it to another level with their nationwide, highly inclusive focus,\" said Cheryl Foil, principal at Kiddar Capital, in an interview with Tech.Co. Our Startup of the Year competition is the best example of practicing what you preach when it comes to inclusion and diversity. As you'll see in the infographic below, our current applicant pool for the 2017 edition is a model of inclusion, with 47 percent minority founders and 34 percent female founders. We've even received applications from 38 different countries. And this, we will assure you, is not an accident. \"Inclusion has always been a priority for Tech.Co's Startup of the Year competition,\" said Jen Consalvo, COO of Tech.Co. \"We work hard to invite and attract a sizable amount of female and minority entrepreneurs and offer an incredible opportunity for them to get noticed by top accelerator programs, investors and industry leaders.\" If you think you have what it takes to be the Startup of the Year, you need to apply today.

      "content": "Fintech was created to rattle the legacy industry that is banking. From lending and investing to deposits and customer service, fintech companies are built with an agile infrastructure designed to reinvent the financial system. These companies can operate quickly and efficiently, something banks have struggled to do in the digital era. However, big banks are resilient. The big players have survived numerous disruptions, most recently the invention of the internet and the dot-com boom. At the end of 2015, the US banking system had $15.967 trillion in assets. It supports the world's largest economy with the greatest diversity in banking institutions and concentration of private credit. For comparison, VB Profiles found the fintech industry to be worth just $870 billion in current value. As more startups emerge and veteran fintech firms become more sophisticated, the conflict between fintech and traditional banking grows. Banks have a vast rolodex of loyal customers, while fintech offers convenience and efficiency, both of which are required to enjoy success in the finance world. \"Instead of continuing to build a divide, fintech and banks must leverage their strengths and work to collaborate, creating an infrastructure that is advantageous for consumers,\" said Patrick Koeck, COO of Creamfinance, an online finance company. Brick-and-mortar banks may seem old school, but they are far from obsolete. Banks like JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo are some of the biggest financial institutions in the world and are staples of the economy. Wells Fargo, for example, has nearly 9,000 branches and over 13,000 ATMs across the country. Banks are deeply rooted in our economy; they hold a monopoly on credit issuance and are a primary repository for deposits. Even more uniquely, banks are trusted by consumers at a level fintech companies are aiming for. Given the propensity of consumers to demand ease of use, convenience, and 24-7 access, the growth of the fintech market should come as no surprise. According to McKinsey, nearly $23 billion of venture capital and growth equity has been deployed to fintech companies over the past five years, and this number is growing quickly: $12.2 billion was deployed in 2014 alone. Fintech companies came to fruition to fill the void and serve the financially disadvantaged. Now, younger, more digitally savvy consumers demand such services that are personalized, emphasize seamless, or on-demand access to an added layer of service separate from the underlying platform. And it doesn't stop with person-to-person payments or online banking. Augmented reality, virtual chats, and big data are all going to be crucial when it comes to communicating with customers. The challenge for fintech startups and big bank incumbents is whether to continue to work in silos or consolidate their strengths for near term and long term prosperity. \"Fintech companies have garnered a reputation for trying to unbundle the traditional banking infrastructure, but that is not always the case,\" says Koeck. \"Due to the better and speedier access to data Fintech companies happen to be more nimble. Smart data provides us with up-to-date knowledge about our consumers, and therefore we're able to react quickly to their expectations. By pairing modern analytics with traditional banking, we have the potential to advance the global economy.\" While it is unlikely that fintech companies will capture all financial services, such as person-to-person payments, international transfers, money management, etc., it is undeniable that they can offer traditional banking an array of valuable partnership opportunities. \"The speed of financial technological innovation means that big companies and banks have to collaborate with entrepreneurs and academics to keep up with the pace of change,\" said Katherine Manuel, SVP of Innovation at Thomson Reuters. \"At the same time, startups and academics need the business input to scale, fund and provide relevance in highly regulated markets.\" Read more about fintech growth here on Tech.Co ",

      "content": "The Muslim fashion industry is making a buzz around the world. This industry can potentially lay claim to represent nearly 2 billion Muslims around the world. Naturally, it is a huge market segment, one that offers $200 billion estimated sales in a year and is gearing towards hitting the $250 billion mark by 2020. Seeing the opportunity, the reputable Muslim fashion ecommerce brand Modanisa is gearing up to increase its market share in coming years. Here is more on how Modanisa is preparing to capitalize on the enormous Muslim fashion market in a grand way. Kerim Ture, cofounder of Modanisa, states that his immediate goal is to take the $200 million up to $1 billion by 2020. Naturally, Ture understands the requisites of exports and doesn't discount the hurdles he and his company might face while achieving this target. Compared to traditional retail style business, ecommerce platforms enjoy several benefits. Customers don't need to come to the store to order; they can do so while sitting at home. Also, order shipping is no more hectic as they'll get the order at their doorstep. But, it's easier said than done. Currently, Modanisa is planning to expand its infrastructure to OIC's member Islamic countries with a huge population. These include Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Morocco. Population wise, Indonesia and Bangladesh have more than 400 million population combined. Fashion is a much-misunderstood term among many Muslims. Even today, some Muslims think of fashion as a form of inappropriate ways of wearing clothes. Their definition of fashion is a dress that covers women from head to toe. Though modern fashion designs are fast changing this presupposition, a sizable population still believes in it. This has created several controversies among some Muslim buyers. Despite that, the Muslim fashion clothing industry is taking the fast lane and is increasing its market share by the year. First, tapping into a $220 billion market is a challenge in itself for a medium-size corporation. Modanisa was no exception to this rule as they had to address at least two problems upfront. First is balancing between product quality and shipping efficiency, and the second is popping up with fast changing trends while growing Apart from these, Modanisa also needs to keep ongoing clothing trends in mind. For instance, up to 18 percent of Muslim e-commerce clothing customers search for traditional Islamic dresses like Abayas and Shalwar Qamiz. Hijab is also getting increasingly popular among Muslim women customers. It is a type of head covering that comes in different color and designs and can be made out of different materials. Both these dresses are comfortable to wear and are available at cheaper rates. There is a good reason as to why Modanisa gives credence to this market segment. Though it is small in size, it is still the fastest growing segment in Muslim e-commerce clothing market. Ecommerce stores can establish virtually so customers have no worries about buying from a retail store. They can order their favorite item from home. According to this study, the Muslim global state economy is rising each year, which is good news for e-commerce businesses like Modanisa. According to Ture, the company has several plans to capitalize on the rising Muslim fashion market. Muslim women fashion requirements have rarely been addressed. To this day, women are not sure about what to buy and what not to. They are under pressure as they live in a moderate, often conservative society. For a real time, the big black burka was the epitome of fashion for these women. Another reason as for why Muslim women were left behind in moderate and fashion was because of apparel producers. They didn't want to end up in any controversy, so they kept modifying the same design over and over for decades. New designers looking to innovate Muslim women fashion had no channel to market their designs. Keeping traditional e-commerce business practices aside, Modanisa has worked out on some innovative strategies by partnering with known business entities like ClothingRIC. Customers looking to buy Modanisa clothes can now buy them on discounted rates using coupons they spread online. Also, they'll find deep discounts on clearance sale and selected items. On the other hand, they'll get free shipping on some stocks and deep discounts on others. This strategy build up the customer mind rational about the brand: It means quality, trust, and an average of five dollars saved on every purchase. With Modanisa in business, they now have a real e-commerce platform to portray their designs to a huge audience, and they seem to be doing it wisely: The Global Islamic Economy Report has credited Modanisa as the most popular and responsible conservative fashion brand in the world.

      "content": "In the business world, information has replaced industrialization and brought inescapable competition to the market. Now, companies have no other choice but to thrive at what they do and be ready to walk the extra mile. The power has shifted from businesses to customers, and unless they're happy, it's next to impossible to boost the conversion rate.  In case you've just launched a new startup, you have to try every bit possible to convert as many leads into paid subscriptions as possible. This is the only way to survive in today's cut-throat competition. Here are five such tips that will help you keep your customers happy, and boost conversion rate in a hassle-free manner. You cannot simply expect your social media executive to address customer grievance issues and handle them properly. Even if you force them to do so, they won't be able to serve properly. Since you're in the market to build a brand that can last an entire lifetime, don't try to find shortcuts. Hire a separate customer service team which doesn't let any customer query go unresolved. Make every possible effort to ensure that your customers don't feel cheated at any point. A customer can know your brand's worth and effectiveness only if they try your products and services himself. Unless that happens, you cannot expect much. So, your objective should be to make customers try your products/services. Since the present era belongs to the information age, there is no chance you can run a business without having a website or mobile app. Make certain arrangements to ensure that whenever users browse your site, they become tempted to use your services right away. A beautiful landing page can help you do that. You can convert your website's home page into a landing page, create a professional logo and use a fully optimized theme to increase conversion rate in a hassle-free manner. From Amazon to Facebook, all the major companies use landing pages to collect leads and convert them into customers. You can also do the same and get desired results. Have you ever thought that last time after you searched for a smartphone or furniture piece on Google, you started seeing the ads revolving around the same product on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram? Do you think it's a miracle or some data hack? No, it's not. It's just an attempt of Google to ensure that you get your desired product in a hassle-free manner.  Convenience is all that matters. The better you serve your customers, the more convenient it will be; and the more convenient it is, the higher are the chances of them buying your products/services. If you want to improve the conversion rate, then reduce the customer efforts as much as possible. Along with the proper listing of products on your website, create a detailed FAQ page and answer every possible doubt that customers may have. Moreover, provide them more than one mediums (call, email, live chat) to connect with customer support team to ensure that they don't panic if something doesn't go according to their expectations. The growing reach of digital media has given users the power of expression. Believe it or not, but they like it this way. The more empowered they feel, the more time they spend on any particular site or mobile app. This is one of the reasons why sites like Facebook, Twitter, Quora, etc. get insane amount of traffic every day. Users want to be on these platforms because they know their voice will get heard. You can reverse engineer this process and use it to increase your conversion rate. Whenever users head to a good e-commerce site for any purchase, they first collect information about how effective the customer feedback support system of that site is. Their objective is to ensure that if something doesn't go according to the expectations, they can simply reach out to someone and share their pain (and get their queries resolved). You can give them what they want and boost your conversion rate. Improve your customer feedback system, patiently resolve their queries and get desired results. The only reason a user shares his personal email ID with you is that he trusts you and your products, and somewhat interested in getting relevant updates from your side on a regular interval. Don't prove him wrong by sending spam emails every single day. Email opt-ins are used ineffectively by most online retailers. Be the change and use your email list to build a community of trusted customers. When you share updates that really matter to customers (and not you), you are likely to get a better response from them. Keep this point in mind and forge ahead accordingly. Besides, you can also make use of social media promotion, lucrative offers from time to time, effective ad campaigns and many other strategies as per your location and niche.

      "content": "With no business plan or working capital, it can be hard to build a business. However a driven work ethic, unending passion, and some family recipes, Lisa and Vincente Gutierrez opened their food truck business, Dos Hermanos Taco Truck, and rolled right into entrepreneurship. The couple met at a restaurant where Lisa was the manager and Vincente was the line cook. Together they had dreams of owning their own business and creating jobs. On a whim, they decided to buy a food truck from their friend, borrowed pots and pans from friends and family, and launched their food truck with recipes from Vincente's family from Oaxaca, Mexico. \"In 2012, we just opened the business and the community supported us and loved the food,\" Lisa said.  As their business began to grow, Lisa needed to build her entrepreneurial skills and find ways to expand the business. Lisa turned to the Columbus Economic & Community Development Institute (ECDI). The non-profit economic development organization helped provide Lisa with a place to park their truck, access to a prep kitchen, and offered affordable classes to help market the business. \"I had no idea about mobile food vending, how to write a business plan, social media or how to make a logo,\" Lisa said. \"They had a women's business center attached and I got my business hat on!\" In 2015, Lisa was accepted to the Entrepreneur Exchange Program, funded by the SBA ScaleUp America initiative. This nine-month program is a community-focused initiative where business firms can grow by leveraging, networking, and complimenting the existing resources and expertise in their areas.  Through the program, Lisa was able to leverage her networking opportunities to expand their business that included two food carts and became vendors at sport stadiums and local hot spots. \"The ECDI made our business credible. We were noticed by the North Market and they wanted to bring in authentic Mexican cuisine - we were one of three businesses chosen. [Most importantly,] I knew having that restaurant in the market would break the cycle of not being able to create jobs,\" Lisa said. Through heavy social media marketing, word-of-mouth and expansion, Dos Hermanos became a recognizable brand. \"We are in the Ohio State stadium serving tacos on game days for football and soccer, and serve as a pop-up restaurant at JPMorgan Chase's McCoy Center. Being in front of these large crowds and companies make us credible,\" Lisa said.  When it was finally time to get a loan to expand her business, the network she'd developed in the community was helpful. \"Just by talking to the small business bankers and connecting with Chase it had really helped our small business grow,\" Lisa said. While their dreams of owning a business and creating jobs are coming to fruition, there are always unexpected twists and turns as an entrepreneur. \"I was surprised by how much it took to run the business. I was the cashier and taking the orders and I couldn't foresee myself not being on the truck however, as we stated to grow I couldn't be everywhere. I needed to let go and put people in different roles, and they were amazing. The strength in our staff and empowering them has allowed us to continue to grow the business. [Each day I say] wow! I'm surrounded by a bunch of talented people,\" Lisa said. This article is part of a Startup Week content series brought to you by CHASE for BUSINESS.

      "content": "Medical marijuana has been a hot button issue in the US for years now. While a growing number of states have made this medicinal methodology legal, many states have a vast array of regulations and laws in place that are preventing potential patients for acquiring medical marijuana quickly and easily. One of these states is New York, in which doctors are required to register for the NYS Medical Marijuana Program and obtain a special certification in order to prescribe medical marijuana making access to care extremely limited. Fortunately, one company is looking to change that. NuggMD is a California-based leading telemedicine portal that connects qualified medical marijuana patients with licensed physicians online. They've assisted more than 40,000 California patients in obtaining an online medical marijuana consultation with a licensed physician, and they've set their sights on the challenges of the New York market. \"Although New York approved medical marijuana in 2014, barely 14,000 people legally have access to it because of restrictions on the visibility and number of doctors,\" said Collin Mann, CEO at NuggMD, in a press release. \"This is a trend we've seen across the board in states with new marijuana laws on the books. Access should be feasible, but it's not, and we're going to change that; our network of cannabis-expert doctors will accelerate that change better than anyone else.\" With their launch in New York, the company is excited to enable participating New York physicians to provide convenient and efficient care to patients statewide. And with only 884 of the 110,000 practitioners in New York registered for the NYS Medical Marijuana Program, they have got their work cut out for them in the Big Apple. \"It's frustrating that we can't find a practitioner, especially while knowing that children in different states have full access to this medicine\" said Dr. Amy Piperato, a doctor in NY whose daughter has epilepsy. With more and more patients boasting about the benefits of medicinal marijuana and an increasing numbers of states getting on board, the obstacles to meaningful patient care should hopefully dwindle in the coming years. But in the meantime, it's great to have a company like NuggMD on the front lines of the medical battle with regulations.

      "content": "Sometimes the hardest part of starting a new company isn't creating the product or service itself; it's communicating what it is, what it does, and why people should care about it. Many startups struggle with brand identity and marketing their product or service, which is just one reason why they often fail. It's not due to lack of good ideas or hard work, it's because of lack of awareness in the marketplace. Social media can be one of the most cost-effective means of increasing brand awareness for your startup. But don't be fooled - social media is NOT free advertising. (More on this later.) If you asked me back in 2009 or 2010, I would have said differently, but the landscape has changed. Back then, very few companies were leveraging social media, and there were far fewer cat videos and political rants popping up in people's feeds. Now, Facebook is saturated with all kinds of content, and for a company to get noticed and build brand awareness they need to be a lot more strategic. Many B2C startups struggle with the same question: \"How do we get more Facebook/Twitter/Instagram followers and fans?\"  Here's a quick step-by-step guide for startups to build a social strategy that will increase your brand awareness and help grow your startup. Before you do anything else, reserve social media handles for your startup.  This crucial step is often overlooked but it will be crucial to social brand awareness and success down the road. When it comes to securing social handles, consistency and simplicity are key. If your company's name is \"Jitter's Cafe\" the ideal social handle would be @jitterscafe across all social platforms, and for Facebook, the unique URL would be Facebook.com/jitterscafe. Keep in mind that apostrophes, commas, and quotes will not work in a social handle on twitter or Instagram. Also, it's important to keep the handle as close to the real business name as possible. Make it simple, not something that consumers need to guess. For example, if possible avoid handles like @jitterscafeofficial, @jitterscafeHQ, @jitters_cafe, @jitterscafe1, etc. It's also important to try to secure the same handle across all social platforms. Putting @jitterscafe on your company materials (rather than several different handles/platforms) will streamline your marketing efforts, and it will be easier to promote your social channels and cultivate engagement by asking consumers to remember just one succinct handle. Once you have your social handles secured, you can keep them dormant or inactive until you develop a strong content strategy. Meanwhile, you'll have peace of mind knowing your brand name is secured across all of your social channels. Before launching posts on your company's social media accounts, it's wise to first build a content strategy and distribution calendar. Without that, many startups will quickly find themselves either too busy to post, bereft of ideas and content, and/or missing out on opportunities to capitalize on trending topics/events that are relevant to your brand. You want your content to be intentional, consistent and engaging, not random and haphazard. I often hear small businesses and startups say they don't know what to post on social media. The best way to create a basic content strategy is to establish a weekly or biweekly routine. For example, \"Pro Tip Tuesday\" could be your weekly tips that offer free advice or insight about your industry, providing your customers with something of value on a regular basis. The end of the week could be \"Fun Friday,\" where you share an entertaining photo or video showing off your company culture or give props to valued customers. Consider creating a mix of content that hits these notes: These are just a few examples of how to create/curate content that goes beyond just talking about your product or service. Once you've mapped out your ideas and put several weeks' worth onto a calendar so you can establish a regular tempo for publishing it, you're ready to go live. Set your accounts to active and begin posting on a regular basis, per your content calendar. This can seem like the most FUN part of the process, but it's important to remember that a successful social media strategy isn't just about what you post - it's about interacting with your followers when they engage. It's like building a relationship: nurture it and it will flourish. Another critical aspect of going live is gaining as much organic traffic as possible by strongly encouraging your employees, friends and family members to follow the social accounts and interact with the content by liking/commenting/sharing/retweeting the content. Also ask them to encourage their friends and family members to do the same. The more organic fan growth and engagement you can attract early on, the more credibility your brand will gain, which leads to picking up new followers AKA potential customers. At the beginning of this post I mentioned that social media is no longer free. Facebook especially has become so saturated with with content that it is crucial to break out of the clutter and be original. But original and unique content is only effective if people actually see it. Part of your social strategy should include boosting content (on Facebook), which essentially means paying to place it in the news feeds of people who do not yet follow your page. Even a small budget for a small startup can make a big different in social media growth and engagement. Some large companies boost every post for a few thousand dollars, while startups might spend that in an entire month, or year. Regardless of your company's size, keep in mind that social media is an extremely cost effective platform compared to traditional advertising, and it provides significantly more user data than does a billboard, magazine ad or even a TV commercial. That data can help you hone your strategy for attracting new customers and keeping current clients engaged. Most startups have a limited marketing budget, but instead of spending hundreds of dollars on swag each month, allocate those funds toward boosting content on Facebook or expanding your reach on Instagram. You will likely see much better engagement and fan growth at a more rapid pace than if you opt not to put resources behind a social media advertising budget. Stickers, t-shirts, and key chains emblazoned with your startup logo can be cool, but if you really care about growing your business - especially if you want it to eventually be acquired or have an IPO - focus on the most cost-effective methods with the highest return on your investment. Now that you've created an effective social media strategy, a publishing schedule, valuable content, and understand the ROI of boosting that content, don't go dark. It's absolutely critical to continue creating compelling content and share it on a regular basis. The moment your social media presence becomes sporadic or - shudder - disappears for a while, your engagement will begin to drop and you'll lose momentum. Stay consistent, and don't be afraid to experiment with new content ideas or new ways to share things. This article is courtesy of the Galvanize blog.

The company filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday revealing that it had raised $867,861 out of a $1.5 million offering. It claimed 13 investors so far were involved in the round. Reached on Thursday, Peter Van Alstine, Redd's CEO, said he couldn't comment until the round closed. This is the company's second significant round of funding. Last year, it raised $1 million from a group of investors led by Dan Nordstrom, CEO of Seattle-based Outdoor Research, and Greg Hanson, founder of Skyline Capital, a venture capital firm in Seattle. That funding helped the company grow its product line and fuel a nationwide expansion. Nordstrom and Hanson joined Redd's board at the time, joining Van Austin; Alden Blease, the company's founder; and Keith Canning, president of Pine State Trading. Redd -- which stands for Research Enhanced Design & Development -- was founded in 2014 by Alden Blease. The company prides itself on its organic, energy-rich protein bars. It now offers three flavors -- chocolate, peanut butter, and oatmeal. It has attracted the attention of some celebrity boosters, including Sir Richard Branson.

      "content": "There comes a time in the life of every company when something bad happens. Whether something is deficient or someone else tried to take a piece of the action, every business has gone through a time it would prefer to forget. So when you're trying to sell the business -- or pitch it to investors -- at some point you are going to have to bring up the bad stuff. If you don't, they'll find the skeletons in the cupboard themselves. What I've found through running a firm that helps online business owners sell their companies is that the best move is to get in front of your mistakes and own up to them. However, this can be scary, and you don't want to destroy a potential deal. So when it comes to dealing with the ugly stuff in your business's past, follow these three simple steps. You have two choices: Hide the ugly parts of your business and hope no one goes digging, or embrace the negatives from the beginning. Show the potential investor or buyer that you are not afraid to portray an honest appraisal of the business. As a result, you will convey respect, and hopefully they will too. \"If you're talking with an investor competent enough that you'd want her to invest in you, that investor will also be competent enough to surface the negative information you're trying to hide,\" said David Teten, a partner with venture capital firm FF Venture Capital. \"By surfacing the negatives early, you help establish a relationship of mutual trust and respect.\" When an investor or buyer inspects your business, the tendency is to balance both reasons why your business may be a good investment against any reason why it may be a risky one. In other words, while an investor or buyer may be tempted by the opportunity, they are still looking for all the reasons they should possibly say \"no.\" For this reason, at Quiet Light Brokerage when we represent an entrepreneur who wants to sell their online business, if there are major problems we make sure to tackle those negatives head-on. For example, I recently represented an online magazine whose previous 12 months saw a decline in revenue. We spent a lot of time analyzing the root cause so that we could identify potential solutions. As a result, fewer potential buyers mentioned those declining revenues as objections. A pitch won't be compelling if an investor is only left with a sense of all that is wrong with your business. So it's important to show investors what impact those negatives have had on the business as well as how you dealt with them -- or plan to deal with them in the future. Remember that investors want to be on your side. They're looking for good investments. So if you can explain how to correct or mitigate the bad stuff, they'll be inclined to agree. \"Your investors are on your side,\" said Chris Young from Revel Partners. \"When you win, they win. You're running a startup, which means that investors don't expect everything to go smoothly. No one likes hearing bad news -- or delivering it. But investors would rather hear bad news now, when there's an opportunity to fix things, than later when there isn't.\" So when you address the bad news in your pitch, don't just let it sit there like the elephant in the room. Instead, explain how being proactive can overcome or minimize the risk. Some bad news is just bad -- you need to take a deep breath and own up to it. But what you or others may see as problems in the business could actually be spun as opportunities, if you shift your thinking. When my company helps a client sell their business, we try to look for areas where an investor can find quick, natural growth. Often, these are areas that the existing owner sees as problems or deficiencies. For example, we recently represented an e-commerce website that had hundreds of thousands of dollars in inventory. The order fulfillment operations restricted growth and significantly drained resources. So we worked with our client to determine whether a third-party logistics company could replace his fulfillment option. The result for investors was a lower cost profile, less management overhead and more freedom to scale faster. Our nature as entrepreneurs is to be optimistic. We are driven by successes, not failures. But when it comes to pitching our companies, it's important to spend a reasonable amount of time addressing the bad stuff. This doesn't mean you should convince the investor that your business is a bad investment. In fact, do the opposite -- explain how the bad stuff can be overcome, how your business is resilient, or how it may be an opportunity for growth. If you do this, you will come across as reasonable, intelligent and competent.

From Michael Phelps showcasing his experience in Rio to Kobe Bryant playing in his final NBA game to the Emmys taking us behind the scenes, this new form of social media has taken the world by storm. However, this new phenomenon doesn't stop at celebrities. Everyone's newsfeed is now filled with friends and family live streaming concerts, documenting their travel excursions, and simply broadcasting their own digital soapbox. As a marketing expert, I believe now is the best time for businesses to jump on the Facebook Live bandwagon. Not only is it one more exciting opportunity to showcase who you are as a company and what makes you unique, but Facebook also gives priority to Live videos in people's newsfeeds. It's an opportunity to break through the clutter. So what's the best way to use Facebook Live? Take a look at these tips and you'll be on your way to a viral live stream video in no time. You want to come across as authentic and genuine, so don't read off a script. Prior to going live, think about what you want to accomplish and what you want your followers to take away. Are you a restaurant showcasing the prep work behind your meals? Discuss the details behind your recipes and give us a tour of your kitchen. In order to increase views and engagement, let people know ahead of time that you'll be going live. For example, one of our clients will be rehearsing for their big show at a set date and time, so we let our followers know that we'll be broadcasting live on Facebook so they could get a sneak peek. Post a day or two ahead of time, explaining what you'll be broadcasting and what time you'll be doing it.  While authenticity is important, it's still necessary to have quality lighting and sound. If users can't see or hear your live broadcast, they'll stop watching immediately. Invest in a wireless lavaliere that you can plug into your phone, and record only in well-lit areas. People love going behind the scenes. Facebook Live is a great opportunity to showcase your company, how your product is made, or capture a day in the life of an employee. Give us something that we wouldn't be able to see elsewhere. As a result, individuals will be more apt to watch your future broadcasts. Yes, keeping your phone steady during a selfie is down right impossible. But for the sake of your viewer's stomach, refrain from a mobile rollercoaster ride. Be sure to hold your phone steady and make slow movements in transition. Facebook Live allows viewers to ask questions during broadcasts. This is a great time to address them. Be sure to mention the person's name when you address their question so you're speaking directly to them. You also shouldn't forget to respond to comments once the video is over. Your live broadcast will stay on your newsfeed for others to watch, so encourage people to ask questions or comment long after the live version is wrapped.

      "content": "Online security is becoming a serious issue in the business world, especially for startups. Many security measures that businesses put up to try and fend off cyber attacks often fail, leaving them open to variety of problems. These measures fail for a number of reasons, but mainly due to insufficient tech knowledge on the part of the business and talented hackers who seem to get better with technology. Unfortunately for businesses, customers will run as soon as they realize their personal information is at risk. For instance, Yahoo!, a company that has suffered multiple data breaches over the past few years, saw thousands of customers close their accounts after the breach in late 2016. Unlike companies in the big leagues, however, startups cannot afford to lose customers. Apart from the internet, business communication platforms such as IP PBX, VoIP systems, and cellular networks can also be used as conduits for data theft. As such, these platforms should always be kept secure to ensure the integrity of customer data and information. Check out some of the ways startups can guarantee the safety and integrity of their communication platforms. You've employed the latest, enterprise-grade software for your startup to keep data and information safe. However, leaving your server room without any access control measures means anyone can just walk in and access your company's data, even when they're not supposed to. Internal fraud and data theft is a real thing. Therefore, startups should implement access control protocols to ensure that only authorized people have access to data storage areas and network centers. Passwords are an important first line of defense when it comes to securing any kind of business system. Still, many startups overlook best security practices for passwords, creating weak points within the system. As a rule of thumb, passwords should be changed often and not used on more than one account. There are many password management tools out there that enable startups and small businesses to create and manage strong passwords, including LastPass and CommonKey. Instituting additional measures such as two-factor authentication can also help improve overall security. Using a single server for multiple functions exposes your communications infrastructure to many security threats. For instance, using a single server as your PBX server and web server enables intruders to access the PBX system via tools that run on the web server. Plus, if anything was to happen to the single server, multiple elements of your business would go down at the same time, which can be disastrous for startups with limited resources. Use hosting services with a built-in CDN or Content Delivery Network because A CDN mitigates DDoS attacks by absorbing the bulk of data requests. This allows your site to maintain functional speeds too, Cheapest CDNs are not hard to find because for startups every dollar count. Always deploy separate servers for each major communication platform such as PBX and web servers. This will let you increase security for each component and ensure continuity in case one element is compromised. Many of us often get away with ignoring patch and update requests on our smartphones and computers. However, with enterprise-grade servers and business systems, these updates and patches are the lifeblood of any sound communication infrastructure. These updates are always sent out by manufacturers to fix problems that may make your systems vulnerable to attacks. As such, they are an essential part of system maintenance and should always be installed and configured as soon as soon as they're available. System monitoring should be a part of every business' regular routine. System administrators are usually tasked with the responsibility of monitoring traffic at all times, which helps establish a pattern of normal usage. They can then identify unauthorized access by monitoring traffic surges, which is what usually happens when an intruder gains access to the network. For startups that cannot afford the services of specialized IT staff, there are many tools that can be used to monitor networks. With a brief learning curve and some patience, many of these can often be used by non-techies. Read more about cybersecurity here on Tech.Co ",

Cities and countries around the world are innovating everything from fintech to artificial intelligence in pursuit of a more technologically inclined world. And on Cinco de Mayo, the Mexican startup ecosystem is turning more than a few heads. With a number of factors working in your favor, including demographics, market potential, strong, mission-driven entrepreneurs, regulatory support, and its proximity to the United States, the southern third of North America is making its case in more ways than one. \"The Mexico entrepreneurial and venture ecosystem is rapidly on the rise and more sophisticated than the country's 'emerging market' status suggests,\" said Anna Diaz, product and community manager at Draper Venture Network in a Medium post. A startup ecosystem needs support from big players and influential investors in order to succeed. And if you're wondering who is behind Mexico's rise, take a look at some of the influencers fueling the Mexican startup ecosystem below: As a mentor at Techstars, Lucia has made the Mexican startup ecosystem better through meaningful communication with potential entrepreneurs and startup founders. As the International Marketing Manager at Techstars, she has worked hard to identify opportunities that may lead to the development of new products and resources in the region. Fernando believes that Mexico is currently ripe for an entrepreneurial boom, with a large youth population and an increasingly education-focused government, this huge domestic market of 115 million inhabitants could really explode. And with his expertise in innovative business practices, his venture firm could make all the difference in the world. Ariel is an entrepreneur, mentor, and angel investor in everything from web analytics to human augmentation. He believes that the new digitally active population is going to be the biggest drive force in Mexico, and he aims to address their needs with a more online methodology. This small business owner is using his company to support other startups, by providing software that can ensure that their users stay engaged without an internet connection. His belief in the resourcefulness of his fellow countrymen is what fueled his company to make payments, messaging, location-sharing, and ride-hailing apps useful even when people don't have access to data. Being the CEO of an angel investor network gives you a lot of power in a startup ecosystem. This seed stage investment fund is focused on information technology, mobile, healthcare, green tech and social impact startups. He recognizes that investing in startups has become the new hot trend and hopes that Mexico will see an explosion of venture capital, as well as innovation, in the coming years.

      "content": "Unless you live under a rock, you should know that the age of mainstream virtual reality is fast approaching. According to Statista, the total number of active VR users is predicted to reach 171 million in 2018. And apart from gaming, brands are also starting to adopt VR into their marketing. Virtual reality also has an impact in the startup ecosystem worldwide. If you want to see this VR boom in action, check out the six virtual reality startups below and keep your eye out for them in 2017: Medical Augmented Intelligence (MAI) is one of the many startups that aim to incorporate virtual reality into education. It features the Acupuncture VR program, which provide students with a live learning platform. MAI's Acupuncture VR works by connecting instructors and students via live virtual space. Although it focuses on acupuncture, it also offers radiograph filtering, which is useful for studying the human anatomy. The company is also looking to expand into other fields of medical practice. Hopefully, they have something new in store this 2017. You may think that virtual reality is all about altering what you see. However, SpaceoutVR proves that it should also be about what you hear. SpaceoutVR is a virtual reality app that allows you to create your own virtual multimedia space. Its main selling point is that you can inject your own music playlist into the experience. You can also integrate content from external platforms like Soundcloud, Giphy, Google Search, and YouTube. While SpaceoutVR was founded in 2015, the app was expected to go mainstream in 2017. In fact, it was recently featured on NBC's show - Superstore in February 2017. The Metaverse Channel is another startup that integrates VR technology with education. They aim to inspire today's youth by introducing them to historical figures like Einstein and Picasso in a face-to-face model. Just like MAI, the Metaverse Channel augments the learning experience of students with tools and learning resources through VR space. Right now, the company works on custom projects for educators along with virtual set platforms with CBS Digital. A virtual reality startup doesn't have to be tied to an existing hardware like the Samsung Gear VR or Oculus Rift. InvisiVision, for example, is a VR/AR startup that makes their own eyewear. The product's goal is simple - to allow the user to control what they see. InvisiVision's eyewear works by integrating two different image streams into the user's vision. The user, in turn, can choose which stream to view. Currently, the company is focusing on the eyewear's applications in gaming, movies, and interactive marketing. When it comes to storytelling, virtual reality proves to be the most immersive among different content types. That's why Baobab Studios fully embraces VR technology in their animation projects. The company currently has two flagship characters - Mac and Cheez. Along with their robot sidekick Peas, the blundering duo embarks on adventures that ultimately reveal a brand new market in the cinematic industry. You can check out Mac and Cheez in Asteroids and Invasion using mainstream devices such as the Gear VR, Daydream, Oculus, and HTC Vive. Both apps can be downloaded for free on the studio's website. Lastly, Drop is an app that, as of February 2017, is still in its beta stage. It is one of the 20 virtual reality startups funded by HTC in their accelerator program. Drop's main goal is to reinvent web searches by spicing things up with a virtual reality interface. While the app is still in development, you can become a part of the beta phase by signing up on their site. If you're interested in utilizing virtual reality in your marketing strategy for your startup, here is an infographic by KnowledgeHut that can help you better understand the marketing applications of this innovative technology:  Read more about virtual reality startups here on Tech.Co   ",

      "content": "Today, plenty of startups operate in a remote office to reduce their overhead expenses and lessen the time it takes to get things going. Most, if not all, of them use online collaboration platforms to overcome the distance barrier - allowing employees to work together as if they're located in the same building. Others resort to the traditional ways of communicating through emails and instant messaging applications like Skype. Regardless of their methods, nothing beats having a physical office space when it comes to bringing teams closer together. It will also allow you to attract foot traffic, ensure the productivity of employees, and boost the legitimacy of your business. Setting up an office for the very first time is also a significant milestone that indicates growth. Read a quick guide to starting a business culture If you think your business is ready for the next step, below are 5 tools you can use to find your first workplace: Craiglist is a popular site to check for prospective office or commercial spaces and everything else under the sun, just be careful of fake listings and do your research on the property first.  Read about building a company culture at your office here For US-based self-employed professionals and freelancers, you can start with Offices to find your first executive office. The platform also searches temporary workspaces for small companies who are open to office sharing. All of the properties are suited for short-term arrangements, which is useful if you're trying to avoid expensive monthly fees. Offices.net also allows you to request for \"Instant Quotes\" by filling in details about your company such as location, contact information, and team size. This is useful if you'd rather have someone else hunt for a suitable property for your startup.  LoopNet is a good alternative to Craigslist if you're looking for an office space for lease or sale. It includes roughly 800,000 properties across the United States - more than enough options to let you find the exact workspace that matches your company's needs. Just like Craigslist, LoopNet lets you narrow down your search by location as well as specify the type of property you prefer, including but not limited to senior housing, retail stores, and office spaces. Alternatively, you can connect with a certified broker to help you find the best deal for your money.  Lastly, ShareDesk is one of the simplest and most straightforward tools you can use for finding on-demand workspaces - wherever you are in the world. It allows you to search for shared office spaces or business centers for short-term arrangements. Everything else, from payments to customer support, can be done through the website as well. One of the biggest advantages of ShareDesk is that it covers a total of 440 cities in different countries across the globe. It is, however, not the most cost-effective platform if you need a workplace for the long-term. UK-based startups can depend on LondonOfficeSpace.com - a listing site specifically for startups and businesses across the pond. Once you find a property that piques your interest, you can book a viewing and request for the price directly from the website. Another advantage of the platform is the amount of details included in each property page. Other than the property's key features, actual images, and contact information, its location is also marked in the Google Maps widget right below.

      "content": "Nearly a year ago, Instagram announced a business profile option. It gives your customers an easy way to contact you, offers you analytic insights on how your business is interacting with its customers and gives you the ability to promote posts like an advertisement, making your sponsored content appear more often on a user's feed. This tool has now been around long enough that companies have become familiar with the brand, and startups and major corporations alike have switched to it in an effort to improve the promotional power of their Instagram accounts and reach out to more customers. However, the business profile is not necessarily always the best option for a business, and it may not always improve customer response. According to Entrepreneur contributor Madeline Popelka, Facebook went through a similar series of changes with its business profiles in what ultimately turned out to be a move not to better position companies but to monetize their presence on the site. In fact, in some cases, switching to a business profile may actually hurt your brand in the long run. Your connection to fans without a business profile exists purely through your company's ability to attract attention and grow organically; by switching to a business profile and becoming advertised content on the site, you will limit the amount of organic growth you can develop, the amount of natural interactions you can generate and the willingness of site users to spread your brand for you. By relying on advertising instead of organic growth, you will cripple your company's ability to generate that natural interest on Instagram, ultimately serving only to weaken your brand. Brands that have a personal appeal and if customers can see the effects of individuals behind a business -- such as posts signed by a particular employee -- they'll build fonder feelings and a greater sense of loyalty for your brand. However, brands that feel as though they've been computerized and monetized lose some of that personal touch, and therefore the emotional connection they've developed with their followers. Rather than using Instagram's business option, businesses looking to provide advertising and marketing content may find that brand ambassadors and social media influencers are a better choice for promoting a particular product, sale or release. Brand ambassadors are particularly capable of using social media sites to effectively promote your content -- and note that you'll almost never see a brand ambassador turn themselves into a business profile -- because followers understand that many of them are rewarded in free products, which suggests that their interest in promoting the product involves a genuine approval of the product. The brand ambassador's individual genuine interest in the industry reads as genuine to followers, making them popular and effective ways to promote a brand -- something that a business profile does not do. The problem with using Instagram's business account profile is posts you make and promote will now be clearly labeled as advertisements, with the words \"sponsored post\" placed above the image on people's feeds. This is going to make most people automatically scroll down, as in general millennials are disinterested in being obviously advertised to. Content that clearly labels itself as trying to market to us makes us suspicious, and we aren't going to give it a second glance, let alone be swayed by the marketing, which costs money and resources to implement. On the other hand, ads that you simply make as a regular post are more likely to catch someone's eye, as they will initially look at is as an informative or aesthetic post rather than a marketing post. This will encourage them to click \"read more\" if you have a long comment, and may even encourage them to interact with the post, commenting because they know they aren't commenting on an advertisement like a weirdo. An Instagram business profile may help your brand in the short-term, but the effect it has on your customers and the impression it leaves on your business may ultimately turn people off and reduce the effectiveness of your advertising efforts. Switching over may benefit Instagram, but it may not benefit your company. Read more about social media trends here on Tech.Co ",

      "content": "In 2014 Sphero, a robotics company based in Boulder, Colorado, didn't realize that their efforts would be majorly boosted by a fictional robot from a galaxy far, far away. But one of their mentors was Disney CEO Bob Iger, which meant that their company came to mind when Bob needed to bring the robot BB-8 to life as a toy prior to the release of the biggest blockbuster of the 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  They produced the app-enabled BB-8 by Sphero, which sold out within 24 hours of hitting Amazon and retail shelves across the world.  Tech.Co has featured Sphero as early as 2011, when the company was one of our featured startups at the SXSW Accelerator Kickoff, and we've even interviewed them in the past. But in honor of May the fourth, a.k.a. Star Wars day, I grabbed a quick conversation with Sphero cofounder Adam Wilson. Here's what he said on the impact of their Disney deal, and what the future holds. \"Our team created the App-Enabled BB-8 by Sphero which launched in September of 2015,\" Adam told me, \"and we followed that with the release of our Battle Worn BB-8 and Force Band. \"The partnership was transformational to our business on many levels. Working with Disney had a tremendous impact how our team developed products - they are the best at bringing characters to life on screen and our team can now infuse personality into robotics in the same light. Additionally, we now have a team of more than 170 with offices in Boulder, Colo., the UK and Hong Kong.\" Read how humanoid robots could pave the way to Mars So does the robotics startup have plans for future Star Wars tie-in toys? Here's all Adam had to give me: \"While I cannot comment on specifics relating to what's coming next, I can tell you that Sphero is releasing five new products this year. You'll have to wait and see!\" Hey, as long as their new products are half as cute as a tiny, whistling, roly-poly android, they can't help but succeed. Love Star Wars? Us too.

      "content": "Smart cities -- the term for modern-day cities powered by cutting-edge IoT tech -- are starting to emerge. Kansas City's recent award-winning \"smart city\" initiative gathers data from its downtown streetcar line in order to help businesses adjust their services to the flow of foot traffic in the area. One South Korean town has cut buildings' operating costs by 30 percent after installing smart sensors to better regulate water and energy use. NYC is leading the pack: Just this week, Brooklyn will even host a four-day Smart Cities NYC conference dedicated to the topic. Cites and smart tech are a natural fit, since the jam-packed populations of any major city offer the one thing any system-wide tech advancement needs: Raw data. Here's a look at how NYC is leading the way in creating a better connected, more efficient city than ever -- and a look at the impact that a smarter city can provide. LinkNYC Map at Link.NYC LinkNYC offers the best municipal service for the younger city dwellers: free WI-FI broadband from a series of city-wide kiosks that also offer USB charging ports, phone calls, maps, and a built-in tablet that anyone on the street can use to surf the web. Even the machines themselves are smart, according to the company, as they use \"internal sensors to understand the environmental impact on the structures.\" It's the phone booth for the 21st century. The service is provided by the CityBridge consortium in partnership with New York City. Over 800 LinkNYC kiosks are already in place, and 11 new machines in Woodhaven were just announced last month. LinkNYC's goal is to install 7,500 kiosks across the big apple by 2025.

But don't take my word for it: Listen to what Stephen Goldsmith, professor of government and director of the Innovations in Government Program at the Harvard Kennedy School, told the Wall Street Journal:  \"In terms of city governance, we are at one of the most consequential periods in the last century.\" Thanks to the connective tissue of LinkNYC's internet-providing, phone-charging kiosks, New York City is growing smarter every day.

      "content": "Portland-based Ocean Renewable Power Company is in the midst of raising $2.5 million in its second big equity round of fundraising. The renewable energy company has raised $1.31 million out of a $2.5 million offering, according to paperwork recently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The round so far includes three investors, according to the paperwork. Besides putting new capital to work in the company, Chris Sauer, the company's CEO, told Maine Startups Insider that this Series B investment round has also allowed the management team to completely reorganize the company. \"It was really a three-part transaction that completely recapitalized and restructured the company,\" Sauer said. \"The whole idea is to set us up for future growth, which this certainly does.\" The first part of the transaction was to convert all the private debt carried by Ocean Renewable Power Company LLC into equity. They then converted the LLC into a C Corp, and brought new equity into the new corporation, now called Ocean Renewable Power Company Inc. \"So, the net effect is if you looked at our balance sheet before the transaction, we were heavily laden with debt and not a lot of equity,\" Sauer said. \"Now if you look at our balance sheet, it's quite the opposite. It really is setting us up for future growth\" This new equity round has so far brought three new investors into the company, including one major family office, Sauer said. The new capital is being used for general working capital purposes and will fund the company through the end of the year, he said. While the company has generated some revenue, Sauer said it was a negligible amount. This is the company's second big equity raise. In 2009, it raised $13.2 million in a round led by Caithness Energy, which has morphed into a private family office called Spindrift Equities. Counting debt, ORPC has raised nearly $50 million, Sauer said. When including federal and state grants, the total increases to more than $80 million. While the restructuring swept most of the debt off the company's books, it still owes a very small amount of debt to the Maine Technology Institute and Coastal Enterprises Inc., Sauer said. ORPC made headlines several years ago for becoming the first company in the world to generate electricity from the ocean's tides (in Cobscook Bay in 2002) and a river's current (Alaska in 2014) and deliver it effectively to a power grid. The past three or so years, though, the company has returned to the lab to make its technology more efficient and to reduce manufacturing costs, according to Sauer. So far, the time creating \"Version 2.0\" of its underwater electricity-generation technology has paid off, Sauer said. He said the company has reduced manufacturing costs by more than 50 percent and should be ready to deploy Version 2.0 of its TidGen system in Cobscook Bay in Washington County in 2019, and its RivGen system in the Kvichak River in Igiugig, Alaska, the same year. However, it still has a $16 million backlog of projects related to grants it's received for particular elements of its Version 2.0 technology. Communities like Igiugig are where the company's go-to-market strategy begins. It's remote communities like this where Sauer said the company can compete on price with the existing solution of diesel-powered microgrids. There are more than 700 million people around the world living in remote communities that rely on diesel. \"It's a dispersed market, but it's a big market,\" Sauer said. \"And it's a market where we can go to scale.\" As the company penetrates these markets and deploys more RivGen and TidGen systems -- depending on the interior or coastal location of the remote community -- its manufacturing costs will come down and eventually make it possible to target its second-tier market, which are countries that inherently have high electricity prices. Japan and Chile are two such countries, Sauer said. \"There are areas like that around the world where they have good tidal and river resources. Our pricing can't quite get there right now, but we will be able to compete within a few years,\" Sauer said. Ultimately, as Ocean Renewable Power Company scales and is manufacturing 1000s of its systems, Sauer expects ORPC will be able to reduce its costs to a point where it will be able to compete in the U.S. market. \"But that's still years away,\" he said.

      "content": "Running out of cash is one of the top reasons why startups fail. That's why the formula to success isn't always about profits. To get your company ready for the long haul, you must also implement strategies that will minimize the costs of operations. Nowadays, entrepreneurs are getting creative with how they save money on ventures, like going green, allowing remote work, and selling through social media. For online businesses, it's all about using the most cost-efficient and flexible platforms that will help you do more with your money. Below are four simple strategies you should consider: Generating leads is one of the toughest challenges for online startups. For this, businesses need to pay attention to several key components such as landing pages, lead channel optimization, and nurturing strategies. GetResponse is one of the few email marketing tools that has turned into a complete lead generation platform. It can help you create landing pages, manage your email lists, design newsletters, automate marketing content, and a lot more. You can also take advantage of the analytics dashboard to track and optimize their strategy over time. Despite its features and ease of use, you can use GetResponse for way cheaper than using separate tools for email marketing, landing page design, and analytics. That is, until you exceed a thousand subscribers or wish to spice up your lead generation with webinars - then, you'll have to upgrade to the pro plan. Plenty of startups choose to operate remotely to reduce overhead costs. However, ensuring the productivity of your team while working remotely is a big challenge. To bring your team closer together as well as delegate tasks more effectively, you can use an online communication platform like Slack. The main selling point of Slack is that it provides an online startup with a single virtual workspace. You can track conversations, check the progress of ongoing tasks, share files, send private messages, and have live video conversations. The tool also comes with a mobile app so you can stay ahead of conversations no matter where you go. Finally, the base features of Slack can be used for free with no expirations - perfect if you want a no-risk strategy of upgrading your online business from emails and phone calls. Building, hosting, and maintaining a website costs money. A professional web designer, for example, may cost you thousands of dollars if you chose to build a custom website from scratch. With iPage, you can do everything associated with your online presence - from domain registration all the way to web page design. Since the web design aspect of iPage depends on the WordPress infrastructure, you can easily install themes, create pages, and handle other tasks involved in running a website. The platform is also powerful enough to help you build an online store complete with PayPal and shopping cart integrations. Whether you need to track business expenses, send invoices to clients, or do your accounting, you can always count on Freshbooks to make things a breeze. It is a cloud accounting software equipped with built-in project management features - from time tracking to file sharing. Regardless of the platform's depth, it offers a simplified interface that anyone can learn in minutes. Another reason to use Freshbooks is that it integrates with cloud business platforms like Shopify, Stripe, and the G Suite. This allows you to consolidate every aspect of running your online business in a single location. Read more about startup tips here on Tech.Co ",

      "content": "An accelerator supports startups by providing education, mentorship, and financing when needed. In its three-year history, ABQID was just the kind of accelerator that Albuquerque needed. A venture-backed accelerator focused on startups with high growth potential and any kind of outlook. For example, Innobright, a company creating fast and easy rendering processes for animators, was one of the startups in their first cohort in 2014. Since graduating from the cohort, they've since been through several rounds of growth and recently won the Steve Case Rise of the Rest in Albuquerque. Now ABQID has taken on a new CEO and a new challenge. This year, ABQID announced TJ Cook as the CEO of the organization. Prior to taking on ABQID, TJ was CEO of CauseLabs for four years. \"We were kind of an every person's web firm,\" said Cook. \"CauseLabs was the company's internal program for people who wanted to make the world a better place. I decided it shouldn't be an incubator, it should be the company.\" Causelabs has since grown to work with large corporations like Lego and nonprofits like the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. After taking a look at ABQID, Cook and the board decided it too needed a different outlook. After asking their startups to find a focus, ABQID has decided to find theirs. \"It's tough for any organization or startup when your market is potentially large,\" said Cook. \"But we all know that it's worth it to focus on the market that is most ripe for your product and go after them.\" That's why their first cohort of this year will be focused on a theme - health and wellness. The decision was based on the potential market in Albuquerque, the fact that Albuquerque has two world class national labs, the positive lifestyle that one can obtain in Albuquerque, the innovative research from the University of New Mexico's Health Sciences Center, and the impressive programs that the Central New Mexico Community College offer for training and equipping the health and wellness pathways.

      "content": "In a few short years, social media has gone from a pleasant addition to our everyday lives to an integral part of the social landscape. At this point in the game, people that don't have a Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn account are looked at with suspicion rather than pity. Any startup that knows what it's doing has multiple accounts, as well as a notable online presence. However, when it comes to landing your dream job, it could be these very accounts that spell your doom. According to data from YouGov, there are a number of posts that could easily prevent you from getting that second interview. After surveying more than 2000 business decision makers, YouGov was able to discover which kinds of posts are the most likely to raise concerns among potential employers. And the results are a little more petty than you might expect. Aggressive and offensive language came in as the number one reason an employee wouldn't be considered for a position, with 75 percent of decision makers saying that would put them off a candidate, with references to drug use coming in at number two (71 percent). Those are to be expected, as hundreds of blog posts and social media warriors have shown that they will stop at nothing to prevent an offensive troll from landing their dream job. However, the third most common reason employers are put off from candidates is bad spelling and grammar. More than half of these decision makers believe that the improper use of \"their\" warrants more consideration than someone posting drunk pictures of themselves. So before deleting that album of pictures from your trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, make sure to run a quick spell check on your next post.  Wondering which sites you need to scrub before your next interview? Don't worry, YouGov has got you covered, as they also polled decision makers concerning which sites they are most frequently perusing to get this kind of intel. According to the data, LinkedIn and Facebook are the most commonly checked platforms, both at just under half of employers, followed by Twitter (28 percent) and Instagram (15 percent). If you don't feel like doing away with inflammatory posts, references to drug use, and poorly spelling, you could get lucky, as 31 percent of decision makers said that they do not check social media platforms of candidates. Fingers crossed!  While some many think that the social media check-up is an urban myth, don't be fooled. According to the survey, nearly one fifth of decision makers has turned turn a candidate after checking their social media accounts. While startups and smaller companies do so less frequently, large corporations have the manpower to do a thorough check before hiring a new employee. So if you've got an interview at Google, you better start scrubbing now.  Read more about social media behaviors here on Tech.Co ",

      "content": "A supportive startup ecosystem is more valuable to a budding company than any round of funding.

      "content": "I see many of the changes in the ecommerce industry impacting what businesses will have to consider when they add or manage their payment processing systems. This is especially the case for startup founders like myself. The information presented below is based on findings from the customers who use our payment processing platform, and is focused on insights and trends in the type of online payments being used. Many of our customers also deal with offline payment issues that illustrate just how integrated these environments have become. Customers have noted their struggle to figure out what to adopt as some of their patrons prefer the contactless method, using digital wallet tools to complete sales without having to pull out a physical credit or debit card, while others like to use physical cards and are looking for the security that EMV chip readers provide them. Some digital wallets are now starting to support online payments as well, making it more of a struggle to select one over the other in terms of payment acceptance equipment. Some financial institutions are developing EMV chip debit cards that have contactless payment capabilities, which means there is no need for swiping a payment card, bringing together the best of both technologies. With more people accepting these new payment technologies, it's important to assess how you can add these methods to your own business, including enhancing your marketing effort through your own branded mobile wallet feature, loyalty and reward program, or membership format. A wide range of payment processing companies, including my own, offer solutions so you can add an EMV machine to your physical store or add software to accept contactless payments. With more people preferring to conduct their transactions through their mobile devices, including paying for their invoices and completing ecommerce purchases, businesses have to ensure that they optimize for the mobile screen. That means simplifying the navigation process for those looking to make their payments and creating an easy-to-read design that is mobile-responsive. Don't make it so your customer has to pinch and expand the image on the screen just to read what they are paying for and how to complete the transaction or have certain information fall of the page. You also don't want to scare them by sending them from your website to a separate payment website, as this will discourage them from finishing the process. Instead, make it as easy as possible so that filled shopping carts are not abandoned and invoice aren't left to collect virtual dust. While you may already be aware that the sharing economy is taking center stage in 2017 and beyond, it's important to align your payment process with this trend. People are used to sharing services and goods to make life more convenient and get more bang for their buck. And, with most people also used to making some type of digital payment, the expectation that payments can be split up many different ways means you'll have to think about adding peer-to-peer (P2P) payment acceptance where many people pay for that one service or item. The P2P payment system has functionality that lets customers designate who will pay for what part of a bill. Previously, you may have had to key in different card numbers when a party wanted to split the tab two or three ways. Now, you'll be able to receive a payment just with a phone number or email address, allowing various customers to pay you directly instead of having to split it up amongst themselves. Right now, it hasn't yet been adopted as a real business payments option, but as this example shows, it could easily head that direction. More clients we work with are telling us that they must work across channels because their ecommerce customers like the ability to use any online and offline channel when the mood strikes them. This is tied to the growth in the on-demand trend: Consumers may want to buy online and pick up an item or use their mobile devices while shopping in a store to pay for an item they see there so they don't have to stand in line. To solve this dilemma, payment solutions providers are working with other developers on the concept of a unique ID for each customer in order to synchronize all touch and pay points for a single platform. This will make it easier to accomplish the on-demand trend while ensuring that, as a business, you can maintain a consistent payment, inventory and service experience. A complete solution for this approach has yet to be developed, especially since there is a debate around ownership of the data now is being used across channels and how is it protected. While you may have a great business concept and you know there is a target audience for it, compliance and regulatory issues have pegged you as a high-risk business, making it seemingly difficult to tap into the type of payment acceptance options you need to realize the revenue potential. The good news is that there is an ecommerce trend toward identifying the new business segments and models that can drive future growth in the payments industry, so new solutions are being developed to help all types of businesses - from startups with founders that have no established credit to new platforms like crowdfunding and marketplaces to international customers.

      "content": "Being an entrepreneur is scary, exciting, and gratifying. Entrepreneurship elicits so many emotions mixed into one. The same is true about being an immigrant. Momchil Kyurkchiev, originally from Bulgaria, is the CEO and cofounder of Leanplum, a marketing cloud built for the mobile era, with offices in San Francisco, New York, London, and Bulgaria. They've raised $46M in funding from top-tier VCs like Canaan Partners, Kleiner Perkins, and Shasta Ventures, and won VentureBeat's GrowthBeat Innovation Showdown. Momchil has used his life experiences to help prepare for startup life. Momchil shares how being an immigrant has helped him launch a startup. It was 2003 and I had just arrived in the US from my native country, Bulgaria, ready for my freshman year at The College of Brockport in upstate New York. With only two suitcases containing the contents of my entire life, clothes, and my memories, I had everything I needed for a start fresh. Nine years later, as a founder, I was again back to nothing and constantly reminded that 90 percent of startups fail. Layered on top of this stress, my Google employee safety net had vanished. With the odds stacked against me, and terrified that the life I had built in America could evaporate in an instant, I knew I had to make my startup work. My scholarship covered tuition -- but the rest was up to me. To attend university, I borrowed the complete savings of my parents, including their 401ks, and took gifts from extended family. I scraped together enough to cover room and board for my first year, roughly $5,000. Raising funding is a similar experience. You have to rely on friends, family, and fools to get enough seed funding for your first product or service launch. It's a skill set that may feel awkward, but is essential to survive.  Shortly after starting school, I landed a job as the \"smoothie guy\" in the school cafeteria. It was the graveyard shift, from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., earning 50 cents per hour more than the day shift. I worked 20 hours each week, the maximum allowed to work on campus as a full-time student, all while triple majoring in math, computer science, and computational science. I had time only for working, studying, eating, and sleeping. Between university and founding Leanplum (Techstars Seattle '12), I worked at Google for five years. When I left, I knew I was giving up the security of a work visa and paycheck, both of which I'd come to heavily rely on. In a way, it felt like I was a 19-year-old immigrant again, beginning from scratch with no resources. And when I started Leanplum, I was right back at it, coding, talking to customers, eating and sleeping. As busy as I was at university, I was also the happiest I'd ever been. Why? I felt empowered to pursue my dreams with nothing but my vision -- a belief I would need nearly a decade later as an entrepreneur. The thing about entrepreneurs who are also immigrants is we're relentlessly resourceful -- the number one entrepreneurial characteristic. In Bulgaria, there's a folklore character named Hitar Petar, or Clever Peter, akin to Robin Hood. Clever Peter relies on his resourcefulness to succeed, and there are plenty of stories that showcase his wit. His essence lives on in Bulgaria, a nation that may not be the most affluent, but one that is certainly resourceful. It's this trait that has helped me flourish, both in school and in Silicon Valley. Once you jump off that cliff, you can't look back. As a student, I was thousands of miles from my family, and terrified of failure. At the end of my four years, I worked hard and graduated Summa Cum Laude. But standing there with my two suitcases that day, I didn't know that's how my time at university would play out. Five years after launching Leanplum, I'm proud to have built a company that is every bit as successful as I could have hoped. We raised our Series C funding last October, continue to triple our revenue and employee growth each year, and work with the biggest brands in the world, like Tinder, Macy's and Lyft. It was my experience as an immigrant that made this all possible -- an experience that I wouldn't trade for the world.  Read more about pursuing your dreams at Tech.Co.

      "content": "Connections are key to creating a meaningful message. Anyone that has glanced at Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell will know that connectors help spur ideas and messages across a group. For founders, an entrepreneurial ecosystem is no different. Founders may have a great idea, but need help to transform that idea into a startup and ultimately a sustainable business. It is imperative for the people with talent, ideas and motivation to create something and find mentors that nurture their passion which lead to collaborative efforts that drive innovation that creates a fully functioning entrepreneurial community. If connections are the blood flowing through the body of an entrepreneurial ecosystem, then how does a developing body get into shape? We start by celebrating! Connecticut innovators continue  to develop our ecosystem by creating the inaugural CT Entrepreneur Awards and celebrate the entrepreneurs and support system that make Connecticut work. The inaugural awards will recognize a variety of individuals and organizations that connect, collaborate, and communicate amongst each other to help entrepreneurs succeed.  Celebrations offer ecosystems an opportunity to engage all of the players that make a difference. Ecosystems are more than the top startups, they include mentors that offer guidance, the corporate institutions that engage with founders and the organizations that offer unending support. Awards provide an opportunity to meet the connectors that go under-the-radar and spur collaboration as players from different corners have a natural event to meet and discuss their dreams. Entrepreneur/startup award events are an easy way to stop and showcase the ongoing efforts of entrepreneurs in your community and spotlight organizations that help nurture their innovation. It's important to continue to recognize and highlight little wins and provide a path to inspire future founders However, awards are not the only path to finding connectors. Another example of building connections is the KC Connector Project by the Kauffman Foundation that aims to recognize, support and connect the various participants in the KC ecosystem.  The KC Connector Project does a few things for the ecosystem: Connectors in any community matter because they help connect the dots. In the words of the late Steve Jobs: \"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.\" Entrepreneurial communities are filled with connectors from different backgrounds and experiences who just can help connect the dots between talent and knowledge or funding. It's important for these connectors to stay active in the community and link mentors to founders as the result could be game changing. Read more about networking here at Tech.Co. ",

Between fake news deceiving viewers, non-transparent monopolies keeping consumers in the dark, and political bubbles making progress impossible, it's easy to become distracted or even confused about who or what is trustworthy. In the past week, your Facebook feed has likely been inundated with people listing a number of bands and one being a lie.

Add all that to the millions of cute animal photos and pictures of food your mom keeps posting to her wall. So how in this age can a brand cut through all of this noise? The battle for your attention has only just begun, and it's through trust, transparency, and exceptional experiences that a brand will succeed. This is according to the Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff and Casper Mattress Cofounder and CEO Philip Krim, both who spoke at DIG SOUTH Icon, a conference series that celebrates startups, tech, and innovation in the Southeast. \"Brand is what signals trust,\" said Bankoff. \"It's how you can trust something that you click on. Brands that don't provide that trust will be weeded out by the platforms and consumer base. So, we have to take control.\" In the early days of digital media, consumers and publishers treated online content in a very similar manner to print. The printed content would simply be placed online, occasionally there would be a few extra photos, and readers would have plenty of options to choose from. Now, there are practically endless choices to consuming content, which has in turn further empowered Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms to incidentally become aggregates of both news and noise. \"If you post on Facebook, you get a feel for what your friends are sharing or liking. In our case, we believe in quality content, quality journalism. In our case that's going deeper than a lot of what's on Facebook,\" said Bankoff. \"There is a lot of superficial content on Facebook. In fact, the Facebook algorithm is tuned to favor that kind of content. It's changing, there is a blowback on fake news, and people are concerned more about the world. Facebook itself is adapting to that. Facebook is starting to adapt.\" In order to get consumers to buy something online, a brand needs to establish trust. This can be done through having a secure site, product reviews, and eventually a track record for having quality goods. For consumer brands, the process is relatively straight forward; however, for media companies it's a constant challenge even when simply reporting facts. As far as news organizations go, Vox Media is still quite young, yet they have carved out their niche in the way they tell stories, not by gaming the system. \"Google used to be used for content discovery. Folks learned to game the system to get better visibility,\" said Bankoff. Call it black hat SEO or a if you can't beat them join them mentality, Google's algorithms are now fine tuned to focus on surfacing higher quality content. \"Demand Media for example, they just pumped out a lot of content. Then Google woke up and changed the algorithm to favor quality media brands. As a new comer, Vox started to benefit. Yes, we needed to be smart to show up in google results, but what is more important is what's on the other end. You need quality if you want to be sustainable and successful over the long hall.\" Though a constant necessary struggle, trust and transparency is but a foundation for retaining readers or consumers. \"It requires a bit of faith to say we are living in a state of change. Things are not ideal right now. Through all this disruption new solutions are found,\" said Bankoff.  In a separate keynote fireside chat at DIG SOUTH Icon, Casper Mattress Cofounder and CEO Philip Krim discussed how their user experience, transparency, and instances of surprise and delight have led them to rapid success. To start, prior to the wave of jack in the box style beds, they had to go to a store, speak to a commissioned salesperson, and then awkwardly lay on each bed. \"They would try to convince you to spend hundreds or thousands more than you need,\" said Krim. \"The first step we had was to circumvent the traditional experience, traditional retail. That's why we built casper.com, the industry is very tightly control. Two organizations manage most of the manufacturing, and they work hand-in-hand to keep consumers in the dark.\" In response to an outdated approach and being able to cut out a few middlemen, Casper was on a mission to build transparency in the industry with a customer-focused mentality. When they first hit the market, the team started to receive positive press coverage about what they were doing and how they were innovating in the space. \"We thought we'd sell one or two, and convinced some people to write about us,\" said Krim. \"We started selling one or two dozen, then it became terror when we said how are we going to fulfill all those orders. Then it became 100 orders. The supply chain was the biggest pain. It was all word of mouth at first, especially because of the exp and delivery (small mini fridge sized box). It was such a better experience than anything out there that people started talking about it. It's an amazing part of our business.\" Although Casper was not the first mattress company to sell these kinds of mattresses, it's the entirety of their experience that has people still talking. According to Krim, they were the first to really brand the experience. \"We added hand-written notes, etc. We were surprised by how many people filmed the experience online. It's sort of like the foam dino that you add water and it expands. People are having so much fun with it.\" A quick look at both Instagram and Twitter confirms this sentiment, with customers showing off everything from the Casper dog beds to them unboxing their own bed. The other component for the brand is that while they started entirely online and with ecommerce, the team embraces physical retail as well. \"We are at the convergence of offline and online,\" said Krim. Between mobile popups and showing their beds off in various partnered stores it allows consumers to still follow the traditional model if they wish. For their standard approach, Casper will send you a bed for up to 100 days, and if you don't like it, they will ship it back free and then donate it to a local charity or upcycle it to a showroom (after being cleaned). \"We always focus on surprise and delight, because we know how important this product is to people. The science of how it leads to creativity and productivity etc...It's why every detail really mattered to us,\" said Krim. Read more about how your brand can succeed here at Tech.Co. ",

      "content": "The FCC, Congress and the Trump Administration recently reversed proposed rules curtailing internet providers from gathering and selling sensitive customer data to marketers. This new freedom that allows companies like Verizon, AT&T and CenturyLink to enjoy the same data access as internet giants like Facebook, Google and Twitter has increased concern among Americans around internet privacy. What is the impact on entrepreneurs and businesses? Here are three serious considerations: Consumers have become increasingly connected and are constantly sharing information online. They are researching, purchasing and using online products and services, via any number of connected devices. They are also opting in to share their preferences as part of interactions on social media and search sites. All of this customer data is being collected by device manufacturers, desktop and mobile apps, internet providers and mobile operators for their own purposes or to sell to other businesses. Related: The Weirdest Things People Agree to in Terms of Service In many cases, consumers are happy to share information like photos, opinions and locations over Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter. But, when it comes to other, often highly personal aspects of their life -- health, wealth and family -- they are more protective. According to a recent survey conducted by my company, AnchorFree, a staggering majority of Americans -- 95 percent -- are concerned about businesses collecting and selling personal information without permission. Additionally, over 80 percent are more concerned about their online privacy and security today than a year ago. This means that your customers are thinking about privacy when they visit your website, use your app, and purchase your products and services. What are you doing to demonstrate to your customers that their privacy is important to your company? Most businesses today are connected to other business partners in our highly interdependent world commerce. Businesses may be using a hosted webstore, a separate email marketing provider and a different website hosting operation. All of them deploy different ways of dealing with customer's information. The same goes for other business partners, like affiliate marketing and associations. When businesses offer or receive customer referrals, that information is coming and going and potentially exposed and treated differently by each entity. Related: How to Protect Your Internet Browsing Data (Since It's for Sale Now) This distributed approach to information exposure means businesses need to think more broadly and deeply about privacy. Privacy isn't just a few paragraphs that are buried deep in a terms and conditions of use page in your website. Privacy is embedded in everyday interactions with customers. Privacy is something that can impact a brand, disrupt the customer experience and potentially damage a company's reputation. According to a Harvard Business Review study, 72 percent of Americans are reluctant to share information with businesses because they \"just want to maintain [their] privacy.\" And Deloitte, as a part of a study about consumer trust and data protection, explains that data privacy and security is not just a risk management issue, but a \"potential source of competitive advantage that may be a central component of brand-building and corporate reputation.\" Privacy should be a product issue, not just a policy issue. Protecting user privacy will enable you to drive more revenue and gain more customers. Safeguarding customer privacy is more than a protective measure; it is also a strategic opportunity for brand growth and a potential business opportunity for startups and entrepreneurs, as well as large companies. Now that the Administration and Congress are clearing the way for ISPs to collect and sell customer information, more than half of Americans are saying they will investigate additional ways to safeguard their personal information, according to the survey. Related: How Do Google, Apple and Others Stack Up When It Comes to Protecting Your Privacy? Much of that concern may stem from the increased number of connected technology devices that contain personal information. Gartner, Inc. forecasts that 8.4 billion connected devices -- everything from phones to new household devices swept into the internet of things market --  will be in use worldwide in 2017, up 31 percent from 2016, and will reach 20.4 billion by 2020. This increase in connected devices, combined with the increasing consumer concern around security and privacy breaches, will further drive the already substantial market opportunity around privacy. While the previous billion-user companies like Google and Facebook have been built on collecting data, it's projected that the next billion user companies are going to be built around protecting user data. Entrepreneurs and startups have an opportunity to build new business as a result of this emerging reorientation around privacy and trust. Business opportunities will surface around privacy platforms and services for businesses and consumers.

      "content": "If this year's Consumer Electronics Show taught us one thing, it's that every consumer electronics company is trying to \"appify\" its hardware in order to become an internet of things company. But the key word here is \"trying.\" Many of the ideas we saw weren't, shall we say, fully baked; and as a result they fell flat. Related: The 'Internet of Things' Is Changing the Way We Look at the Global Product Value Chain It's easy to fall into the \"app trap\" and connect a product for the sake of saying you're mobile-friendly. But not everyone wants vibrating clothing that helps direct you to your destination via your smartphone's Bluetooth -- that's a real thing by the way. Never heard of it? Spinali Design shorts connect to their wearer's smartphone and helps direct the wearer through urban environments by buzzing when she needs to turn right or left. While the shorts are an interesting application for what technology can do, their contribution is not necessarily something a consumer needs tech to do. That's not to say there is no value in having a connected product, but it's critical to evaluate the \"why,\" the \"how\" and everything in between before you fall down a costly rabbit hole. If you find yourself at a crossroads as to whether or not to connect your product or service, make sure you ask yourself the following seven questions: For many companies, the motivation to create a connected product comes from an executive initiative to be \"tech-forward,\" rather than from a clear customer or business need. Also, if you're a hardware startup, you may be motivated by investor demands: Those people are looking for recurring revenue and SaaS, not hardware, widgets. But if you're building an IoT product and don't know why, you're doing it wrong. It's imperative that you know what your business goal is in delivering this connection. Have you surveyed customers? Is there a white space in your market that's untapped? Take a look at Nest, for example. At a time when IBM's Watson was defeating Jeopardy's champions, the founders of the startup Nest Labs decided they wanted to make an equally thrilling, super sexy . . . thermostat. Why rethink a device in homes that most people ignore? Because there was a huge opportunity to help homeowners reduce their energy bills. And helping people save money will always help you generate money. Related: The Internet of Things Promises a Future of Being Coddled by Your Appliances Before you app, however, be prepared to answer the \"why\" question -- whether you're a startup looking to take a risk, or a veteran organization trying to evolve. Many companies building a connected product realize that the data collected from those products can be extremely valuable. But too often they don't go through the effort of understanding where that value comes from or how they will utilize it. Are you going to look for issues and errors so you can provide service and support proactively? Do you have specific burning questions about your customers that data can help you answer? Do you have a retention problem with current customers and want to know how data can help improve those numbers? Having data doesn't create value on its own -- you have to do something with it. Often, the \"next big thing\" has a much shorter shelf life than anticipated. Take smartwatches, for example. The wearable industry is set to take off  -- and the smartwatch was the first of these products to test the waters. What's more, expectations for the market were initially high; but, contrary to forecasts, IDC reported late last year that shipments were down 51.6 percent year-over-year for the third quarter of 2016, and even tech giant Apple saw shipments drop 71.6 percent. So, why is the smartwatch industry floundering? Because these items don't solve any burning problems, so the market doesn't extend far beyond early adopters. Pay attention to your product's staying power. It may be overused and talked about ad nauseum, but it may not stick around. A great example of a device with staying power? Alexa. Why? It capitalizes on consumer demand and provides next-generation convenience to its users by acting as a virtual assistant. Other big name companies are picking up on Alexa's longevity. Starbucks, for example, announced this year that it's \"taking the next step toward evolving the digital customer experience by launching voice-ordering capabilities within the Starbucks mobile iOS app and the popular Amazon Alexa platform.\" This latest move will let consumers order their favorite coffee on demand without having to lift a finger. Starbucks essentially simplified an already relatively easy task -- ordering through your phone. But now, thanks to Alexa's voice messaging capabilities, Starbucks has brought the barista to you by connecting its mobile app to your in-home personal assistant. The moral of the story is that assessing the practical application of your product will help determine the difference between fad and forever. While staying competitive with other vendors is crucial for the life of a company, creating a copycat product when the competition is the current authority on that niche isn't going to garner the desired results. If anything, you'll just look like you're playing catch-up -- and that's the last thing you need when coming out of the gates with a connected product. LG rolled out its Smart InstaView refrigerator at this year's show but industry talking heads said it was virtually the same as Samsung's Family Hub refrigerator. Both appliances offer a large touch screen that allows consumers to track their groceries and expiration dates. Both offer -- believe it or not -- a full Alexa integration, meaning that those consumers can use voice commands to build grocery lists and order more groceries. The only real difference right now is that the Samsung product was revealed almost a full year earlier. Of course, time will tell how well it tests in the market. But, for LG, coming on to the scene under a veil of skepticism and observers' mentality that \"This has already been done\" isn't an ideal way to launch. That's why before you launch, you should ask yourself what other improvements or offerings you can offer that show you're one step ahead, instead of two steps behind the competition. Finally, there's price. The average hairbrush costs around $10, and most people today brushing their hair don't need any kind of direction. However, if you want stats on the health of your hair and advice on how to best brush, L'Oreal has created the Hair Coach -- an \"under $200\" product. Will it fly? Who knows? Related: The Internet of Things Demands That Customer Service Catch Up With any kind of change in a company -- be it new leadership or a shift in your business model -- there's going to be an element of risk to any new product. But before you take the plunge into connected products specifically, assess the true value you'll provide the customer and whether or not you need to put time and energy into something that could be either brilliant, or simply \"excess tech.\" Zach Supalla is the founder and CEO of Particle, an IoT startup that's making it easier to build, connect and manage internet-connected hardware products deployed at massive scale.

      "content": "When I started my task management app Moo.do with my co-founder, Grant Watters, our goals seemed too ambitious for the two of us alone. In order to make everything work, we would need to hire developers to build the backend and manage the servers. To afford that, we would be stuck investing months into getting VC funding. And then it would take a few more months to hire employees and ramp them up. And all of that would be before we could start validating whether customers would like the product. Fortunately, we started Moo.do right when the Google Drive Realtime API and Firebase were launching. We realized we could skip the backend completely, save a huge amount of time and money, and bootstrap the company ourselves. Serverless is the hip new trend in web development these days. The idea is that your server code runs \"in the cloud\" and you don't have to worry about scaling or managing servers. It's a great way to reduce the work required to build a web app. But, we took it even further: Moo.do is fully client-side and we use free external services as our backend. Related: 10 Steps to Building an App People Will Love OK, that's actually a little bit of a lie. We do have a small server just for minor user account details like settings and billing, but that's it. Moo.do is an email client, to-do list, kanban board and calendar, with real-time collaboration on all desktop and mobile platforms. This is a big undertaking, and it would have been impossible if we had to build the backend required for large-scale data storage and real-time collaboration as well as the web and mobile apps. All of a user's private data is stored in his personal Google Drive account and Moo.do uses client-side APIs for everything:  When you launch Moo.do, the whole app is downloaded and stored locally in Application Cache so that it can work offline and to speed up load time. It loads any local data stored in IndexedDB and then connects to the Google Drive Realtime API to set up the real-time sync, and syncs with the Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Drive APIs. And finally it quickly pings our server to confirm the user's premium account status. Related: How I Overcame My Fear of Hiring Outsourced Developers In typical web apps, most of that would happen on the server side instead of on the client side. Doing it all client-side might sound crazy, but I'll explain why it works so well. We added real-time collaboration to our initial prototype in just a few days with the Google Drive Realtime API. This allowed us to quickly build a working product to prove the idea. Otherwise, we would have had to invest a huge amount of time in building a real-time collaboration system before we could even validate whether people liked the product. These services and APIs are free, so we're running at near zero variable costs. We don't have any extra money to waste since we're bootstrapping our company, so lower cost extends our runway. A downside to a freemium business model is that the free users can drive up costs that need to be offset. But in our case, free users cost us almost nothing. We don't need backend engineers because we have no complex backend to engineer. And we don't need systems administrators because we have no systems to administrate. We are able to build this as just two founders with no employees and no VC funding. Related: 3 Ways to Build a Mobile App With No Tech Skills Building a backend for real-time sync and collaboration would be a tremendous amount of work. Ain't nobody got time for that, so we skipped it. And a heavily used API that's well tested by Google is going to have fewer bugs than code we write from scratch. Of course, every API or service needs some work to fit into the app. We have a lot of client-side integration code, like conflict resolution to support offline usage, but everything else is taken care of by Google. Because we're running our backend almost entirely on Google services, we're able to run at Google scale. Moo.do could gain a million new users overnight and everything would be fine. We don't need to throttle signups or worry about being taken down by a Reddit Hug of Death. Moo.do uses Google OAuth to sign in, which has the huge security advantage that we never receive a user's actual password. All items, tasks and attached files are stored in each user's personal Google Drive account. Gmail and Google Calendar are synced completely client-side, which means that emails and appointments do not pass through and are never stored on our servers. Not storing users' private data on our servers protects their privacy and limits their potential exposure to hacks. Related: 4 Things You Should Know About Google's Rebranded G Suite So in conclusion, everything is great and there's no downsides. OK, that's another lie. Giving up control of our backend does have some drawbacks: Google has been known to shut down services. This presents a risk, but the company typically gives a warning beforehand and a long window to migrate away. It is investing heavily in Google Drive, and we don't see Gmail going away anytime soon. The dependency on Google is a risk, but we feel confident that these services will stick around. There's always a risk that a new bug will appear that is out of our control to fix. The Google Drive Realtime API had some issues in its early days, but the developers were responsive and fixed bugs quickly, and it has been stable for the past two years. Based on the track record of stability and responsiveness, we feel safe. Since Moo.do is served by a CDN instead of a server, it has to be a static page. We cannot send user-specific data with the initial page, so everything has to be loaded by JavaScript. Offline-first apps work best as static pages anyway, so this constraint is fine for us. The only true downside of a static page for us is that it's harder to A/B test because there is no server to decide whether to send the user A or B. So for A/B testing we have to send the user both A and B and then display the right one in client-side JavaScript.

      "content": "We're now exiting a long era of skill specialization, when workers could flow through entire careers in the same field, if not the same job. Now, machines are better than us at performing specialized and repetitive tasks. But, while machine intelligence may replace workers in many jobs, some experts -- like Miguel Nicolelis, the co-founder of Duke University's Center for Neuroengineering -- say that no engineering can ever replicate the capacity of a human brain. Consciousness does not work in an algorithmic, digital way. By tapping our innate ingenuity and adaptability, we can guide intelligent machines and create new work. It's on us to learn how to learn anything. Individuals and companies must get better at transferring knowledge from one field and applying it in another. It's less important to specialize than to recognize equivalents across disciplines. Are you a coal miner who excels at working in teams, handling complicated engineering technology and focusing on one thing at a time? If so, the founders of Bit Source believe that you could also be a great coder.  Related: Will a Robot Take My Job? In another example, the Tesla Gigafactory needed tilt-rotor helicopter mechanics to work on construction. Positing that military veterans with that skill might not be aware of how it could transfer, Tesla used targeted ads on RallyPoint, a networking site for the military and veteran community, and sussed out likely candidates. Take inventory of what you know and what skills you have, and then start imagining how they could apply or transfer in different contexts. The internet is a \"choose-your-own-adventure\" of learning options, ranging from Wikipedia, instructional videos on YouTube and online courses from Coursera, Udemy and EdX. The Renaissance revitalized humans' interest in self-directed learning, especially across diverse knowledge sets and skills. Just think of Leonardo Da Vinci's work in art and science. We're in an analogous time today. Traditional education denotes expertise with letters after your name, but businesses engaged in rapid innovation are recognizing the value that self-taught people, or autodidacts, bring to the table. Becoming a casual expert is more than simply geeking out and taking a few online courses. Practice is key to how human brains retain and improve knowledge. As learning expert Eduardo Briceno described in his TED Talk \"How to get better at the things you care about,\" people tend to master something conceptually, and then go straight to execution without being good at it. Although the temptation to wing it -- to \"make it up as you go\" -- is strong in our fast-paced world, you must intentionally practice learning to move knowledge and skills into long-term memory. There are critical differences between an enthusiastic amateur and high-functioning autodidact. Related: Emerging Ethical Concerns in the Age of Artificial Intelligence What does intentional practice look like? Essentially, it looks \"lean\" (experiment, measure, iterate). The methodology for entrepreneurs has proven applicable to learning across fields like healthcare and higher education -- industries where training and improving knowledge is a daily process. Some of the most innovative companies study an issue from every conceivable angle to form, test and solidify their knowledge of an issue. Beyond learning as students, they can play the part of teachers and their own dissertation committee. When repetitive practice gets boring (because it does), think like a \"freak\" or apply game tactics to keep up enthusiasm and curiosity. Remember, learning happens when we overcome challenges. In his TED Talk, organizational psychologist Adam Grant talks about how fear and anxiety in the right amounts can spur creativity. Discover what works for you and discard what doesn't. Do it mindfully and skip analysis paralysis. Related: How to Train Your Robot: 4 Ways Startups Can Apply AI Much is being said about the importance of emotional intelligence in the age of AI. Social behavior requires neural capabilities that machine algorithms cannot replicate. Alan Turing never designed a test for creating inside jokes or analogies to explain the quasi-religious feelings associated with seeing a provocative piece of art. Remember, learning by cataloging is just the beginning; reliably applying knowledge in any context is the goal. Deepening emotional intelligence will help you abstract knowledge by analogy and apply it reliably in new situations, even ones that appear to be unrelated or unknown. Embrace social networking and take time to become conversant in the communication styles and points of view of other professionals and areas of expertise.   Technology will continue changing how people acquire knowledge, but the fundamentals of human learning have not changed since \"Renaissance man/woman\" became a metaphor for polymath. Humans will continue to be makers and pathfinders in entirely new, AI-supported contexts. Jobs will certainly change over the next 10 to 20 years in the face of AI. The people who thrive will have interdisciplinary skills and an eclectic outlook. You don't have to be an expert in everything; just remember how to learn anything.

      "content": "I was at an event recently that screened a 1956 short film -- Key to the Future -- in which GM envisions what self-driving cars would look like in 1976. The footage -- with a uniformed guy in a control tower directing a singing family along a highway for autonomous vehicles -- inspired chuckles from the audience. One aspect of the video that did become a reality is the interstate highway system, a major milestone in vehicle transportation that better connected rural communities and big cities and cut travel time. But they also displaced entire urban neighborhoods when they were constructed and divided others once the work was complete. They enabled mass migration to suburbs for the more affluent, who could now easily commute by car into cities for work. But this sapped the tax base of large cities, setting up prolonged urban decay during the 60s and 70s. Sixty years since the GM film, we're now are on the cusp of another major transformation in transportation with self-driving cars, and some are concerned they will have similarly negative unintended consequences.  Experts think we'll first see fully autonomous cars in urban areas, with city dwellers and commuters alike buzzing around in autonomous pods, freed from the drudgery of driving. Ford, for example, has promised to mass produce fully self-driving cars for ride-sharing purposes by 2021. Uber is already testing autonomous vehicles, while the self-driving tech start-up Nutonomy currently offers robo-taxis rides in Singapore. Urban designer Peter Calthorpe, one of the top minds who spoke at the TED conference earlier this week, has a more pessimistic view of autonomous vehicles and how they could affect cities. While autonomous vehicles offer myriad benefits, such as increased mobility for the disabled and others, Calthorpe is concerned about further isolating people already detached by compulsive interaction with portable devices. \"Putting people in their private bubbles, whether they have a steering wheel or not, is the wrong direction,\" Calthorpe told TED head curator Chris Anderson following his talk. He worries about people using self-driving cars as solitary electronic chauffeurs or butlers that run errands and don't require their owners to ever leave the home. Calthorpe's other concern is that autonomous vehicle \"will revitalize sprawl\" as society becomes more urbanized. Others are also questioning whether self-driving cars could lead to longer commutes if people can be productive while in the car, making traffic worse in urban areas. Hesham Rakha, an engineering professor at Virginia Tech who studies traffic flow, told NPR in February that it's difficult to predict whether self-driving cars will improve traffic congestion. \"I don't know the answer,\" he admitted. \"If the road is less congested, more people are going to be attracted to that road, and so basically it will become congested because it's supply and demand.\" And all those utopian visions of driverless cars making traffic and accidents a thing of the past could look just like as silly as GM's Key to the Future film from 60 years ago.

      "content": "Apply now to be an Entrepreneur 360(tm) company. Let us tell the world your success story.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Started >> Financial struggles, tech experiments and the rise of online shopping -- those are the dominant narrative elements of today's retail industry. But just because people are less likely to walk through the doors of certain stores nowadays does not mean they're not interested in stores in general. The problem, many analysts argue, is that certain retailers are not interested enough in their customers. They're interested in what their customers end up buying from them, sure. But they have a harder time determining what those customers want in the first place. \"Big stores try to be something for everyone,\" says Marshal Cohen, chief industry retail analyst of the NPD Group, \"and they end up being nothing for anyone.\" Related: These 5 Retail Innovations Could Actually Make You Want to Shop in a Store Again The Limited, Wet Seal, Gander Mountain and Payless have all filed for bankruptcy. The head of Sears Holdings has admitted \"substantial doubt\" about the company's ability to stay in business amid closing 150 stores. There are too many big-box stores in suburbs, and today the U.S. urban population is increasing faster than the national population overall. Meanwhile, Amazon is planning a three-day summit to try to lure consumer packaged goods brands away from their retail partners. Amid these shifts, smaller players can't simply look the other way. They should be watching and learning from big retail's shortcomings -- and viewing this moment as one filled with opportunity. It's an oversimplification to suggest that the reason big-box stores are closing is because people are shopping online. The truth is more complicated. For one, a group of traditional retailers is actually growing its ecommerce business faster than the U.S. retail ecommerce market is growing overall, according to the 2016 Deloitte Retail Volatility Index report. When we think of ecommerce sales replacing brick-and-mortar sales, we don't often think of it happening within a company. Retailers who pursue omnichannel strategies may just be taking business away from themselves. \"Unless you are stealing someone else's business by selling online, you're not going to grow your business,\" Cohen says. \"Macy's online business represents 15 percent of their total sales, and yet they're now closing 13 percent of their stores. That number's too close to be coincidental.\" You also can't generalize the state of the retail industry down to one ratio that represents all online sales vs. all in-store sales. Purchasing behavior varies too much from industry to industry. For example, Cohen explains, 30 percent of transactions for technology products or services happen online, compared with only 16 percent of apparel sales. Selling online isn't the key to success -- even the big, struggling retail giants are doing that. At the same time, off-price retailers (think T.J. Maxx and Nordstrom Rack) have been thriving by comparison, competing on price and convenience even though they don't have much of an online presence. Moody's analysts expect the sector's sales to increase by about 7 percent this year. \"The conventional wisdom of what's going on actually doesn't bear itself out when you look at the data,\" says Kasey Lobaugh, chief retail innovation officer and omni-channel retail practice leader for Deloitte Consulting LLP, as well as a co-author of the Retail Volatility Index report. \"The barriers to entry for retail have fallen.\" Online sales aren't the only tech development shaking up retail. Today, you can sell nationally without a chain of stores and without owning any of your inventory or assets. You can outsource your call center and marketing campaigns. You can reach a large audience via social media. Or you can manufacture and sell your own products rather than selling through a third party. Look across industries, and you'll recognize tech-driven increased competition in the sharing economy, online marketplaces, digital publishing, you name it. Related: Are Retail Brands Ready to Compete in the New Normal? If you're one of countless fish in the pond, what can you do? Reframe your thinking, Lobaugh suggests. He notes that one category of retailers that are performing well today is made up of those that are competing on what's cheaper, faster or easier. It's difficult to achieve success in this way if you don't have scale, he explains. At the other end of the spectrum, there are retailers who have differentiated themselves by offering an exclusive product or experience. \"The way you win is you find opportunity, you find where there's an unmet need, where there's scarcity or where you can build perceived scarcity, and you go after it in an unapologetic, very focused way,\" Lobaugh says. \"But recognize that those windows of opportunity open and close at a faster rate when the competitive fervor is high. So being nimble, to me, means being able to find those, take advantage of them, move out of them and move on to new ones, fast.\" Small retailers, because of their size, are more likely to find a niche and be nimble. But the big question is: How do you stand out? How do you create a unique experience in a sea of competitors trying to do the same thing? If you're an independent retailer with at least one brick-and-mortar store, that's an advantage. But you have to make the most of that physical space. Farla Efros, president of HRC Retail Advisory, says she buys all of her casual clothing from a small store in Toronto. The woman who owns the store keeps a customer book and stays in close contact with her patrons via email blasts, Instagram posts and even text messages. She'll sometimes text Efros to say she's set aside a few items she thinks she might like to try on. \"It's more intimate, like shopping in somebody's closet,\" Efros says. \"That is the difference between success and not in today's world. Even larger retailers are always working toward that.\" This approach fosters loyalty, something that is hard to come by in a fragmented marketplace. Efros emphasizes that competing on price will work in the short-term, but that a long-term relationship is the ultimate differentiator. Establishing a dialogue with your customers also helps you serve them better. As Cohen explains, \"A merchant is someone who can go in, scour the market and pick the best products to fit the personality of their store that openly matches the personality of the consumer who wants to shop in that store.\" To help you cater to that personality, you have to listen to your customers. A shopkeeper who strikes up a conversation with everyone who comes in their store might notice a pattern, say, of multiple people who come in looking for a pair of cowboy boots. When this happens, that entrepreneur might decide, I'd better start selling cowboy boots, this seems like the hot new trend. \"That's the difference,\" Cohen explains, \"the ability to drive your business based on the pulse of the consumer.\" Bob Phibbs, CEO of The Retail Doctor, argues that struggling stores are \"reaping years of poor customer service.\" Generally, people want someone to greet them and they want the store to be clean. But serving them beyond those bare minimum requirements is a prime opportunity to gain insights into what they want -- and seal the deal if they're on the fence about a purchase. Phibbs and Cohen both stress the importance of maintaining a dialogue with customers before, during and after each transaction so there's no guesswork as to whether they're satisfied with the selection. Related: You Need to Stop Making These 5 Customer Service Mistakes \"Yes, there are going to be some customers who don't want your help,\" Phibbs says. \"But at the end of the day, if you're not curious about each and every one who you have coming in the door, you're settling for crumbs when you could have the whole feast.\"  Personalization is key, but that goes beyond offering a combination of products that your customers want. Nordstrom and Converse are among the retailers that have installed customization workshops within their stores. Efros, who studies the shopping behaviors of Generation Z, notes that a desire for uniqueness is especially true of younger customers. Not every retailer can offer made-to-order sneakers, but every retailer should work to curate a one-of-a-kind experience, rather than a one-size-fits-all one. Experience, in and of itself, is what today's customers desire more than material possessions. Research shows that doing makes people happier than owning. Cohen explains that the Great Recession and the internet are two factors that have created a dynamic in which customers no longer aspire to own the latest, greatest products for materialistic reasons. They instead seek items that are going to foster an experience -- think computers, widescreen TVs and even stand mixers in the kitchen. People have \"started building memories, not wardrobes,\" Cohen says. If you want your customers to buy stuff from you, one strategy might be to frame it around an experience a customer might be gearing up for. \"At a big store, the luggage department is not going to say, 'You can put your dresses in my luggage department.' No way, they're not giving up their floor space. They're so structured in their way of doing things, they can't get out of their own way,\" Cohen says. \"A specialty retailer has the ability to say, 'If you're going on a trip, here are all these things together in one place. This all works together.' A holistic attempt at creating this full package.\" Technology has enabled many retailers to start up, but it also presents a dizzying number of options. In-store beacons? Self-serve kiosks? Smart mirrors that enable virtual try-ons? Retailers should be wary of being lured by these shiny objects. \"Why the hell would I go out of my house to go have an alone experience in a mall or in a store?\" Phibbs says. \"Why in the world would I go to find a robot when I could do that with Alexa or Siri or Google just as easy from my home?\" Don't feel like you have to add bells and whistles just because another store is. Ask yourself: What value is this really adding for the customer? \"Like a chatbot,\" Phibbs says. \"It's going to answer common questions, like, 'Where's the bathroom?' and 'Where are the men's socks?' You really think that's a differentiator?\" If you know your customers, you'll be less likely to experiment with irrelevant gimmicks that many customers will find pathetic, such as a DJ in the middle of a men's department. Then there's data. The internet is what has led customers to expect hyper-personalization, and as a niche retailer, you might benefit more from targeting tools than someone who sells to the masses, Lobaugh says. \"I think the small retailer is more empowered today than they once were in terms of reaching the consumer,\" he says. \"Say my products appeal to women between 35 and 40 who have two kids and live in the Kansas City area. If you went back 15 years, my ability to get to that consumer would've been very difficult. I probably would've marketed in a very generic way out to Kansas City. But today, I can be very, very specific, and I can target those consumers in a really formal and sophisticated way.\" The question is whether you have the skills and expertise to use those tools. If you think this type of targeting, or any other type of technology, truly has the potential to take your business to the next level, learning how to leverage that technology could give you a leg up on your competitors. You're better off being a leader than a follower, or doing something others aren't, Lobaugh says. You have to find the solution that works for you. \"Beacons are not disrupting anybody -- today. Artificial intelligence is not disrupting anybody -- today,\" Lobaugh says. \"Those things will take time, and as they become real, you evaluate them and determine how, when and where you can apply those to win.\" Lydia Belanger is an associate editor at Entrepreneur.com.

      "content": "There's a new, dystopian risk to using internet-connected gadgets: If you complain, the company that made it might remotely kill your product. This is what happened to one customer who bought Garadget -- an internet-connected garage door opener. It lets you remotely lock or unlock your garage with an app, or see if it's open. But after they complained about it online and left a negative review, he got an unpleasant surprise -- Garadget had bricked their device. (We first heard the news via Ars Technica.) The customer had left a comment on the support forum complaining about technical issues, asking \"wondering what kind of piece of shit I just purchased here.\" They then followed it up with a negative Amazon review, saying: \"Junk -- DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY -- iPhone app is a piece of junk, crashes constantly, start-up company that obviously has not performed proper quality assurance tests on their products.\" Well, Garadget did not like that one bit. The company disabled the disgruntled customer's device by denying it access to its servers -- and announced it had done as such on its forum (emphasis ours): \"Martin, \"The abusive language here and in your negative Amazon review, submitted minutes after experiencing a technical difficulty, only demonstrates your poor impulse control. I'm happy to provide the technical support to the customers on my Saturday night but I'm not going to tolerate any tantrums. \"At this time your only option is return Garadget to Amazon for refund. Your unit ID 2f0036 ... will be denied server connection.\" Garadget defended itself in a subsequent post, saying it took action to \"distance from the toxic individual\": \"Ok, calm down everybody. Save your pitchforks and torches for your elected representatives. This only lacks the death threats now. \"The firing of the customer was never about the Amazon review, just wanted to distance from the toxic individual ASAP. Admittedly not a slickest PR move on my part. Access restored, note taken. \"A quote from a random guy. \"PS: Anybody has Streisand's phone number?\" But the company has come under heavy criticism on the support forum -- and elsewhere online -- as a result of the action. \"I don't own your product, so I can say this without fear of retribution: What a terrible way to do business. I'll leave an Amazon review, too, just because I can,\" one poster wrote. \"P.S. Please don't change my locks while I'm at work.\"  \"Ironically it seems you have much poorer 'impulse control' and are much more prone to 'tantrums',\" said another. \"Maybe you should stop working in customer support. Doesn't seem like you're much good at it.\" Garadget did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment, though Grisek told Ars Technica that \"there isn't much more to add.\" The whole incident raises a broader issue with the \"internet of things\": If your devices rely on someone else's servers to run, and they can be remotely disabled at any time, do you really own them? In 2016, smart-home company Nest decided to discontinue a line of products built by Revolv, a company it acquired -- bricking customers' devices. The decision sparked outrage from customers, and raised questions about consumer rights in the internet age. \"When software and hardware are intertwined, does a warranty mean you stop supporting the hardware or does it mean that the manufacturer can intentionally disable it without consequence?\" one disgruntled Revolv customer wrote. \"[Then-Nest CEO] Tony Fadell seems to believe the latter. Tony believes he has the right to reach into your home and pull the plug on your Nest products.\" Nest subsequently offered compensation to affected customers to make amends. But what's happening with Garadget shows the issues around internet-connected devices is only just getting started. Rob Price is a technology reporter for Business Insider. ",

      "content": "The term \u201coutsourcing\u201d has become a bit of a dirty word in the software development industry. However, outsourcing software development, -- or \u201cdigital outsourcing,\u201d as it's called -- is a great way to maximize efficiency. Outsourcing certain tasks, a once-taboo subject, is quite common: Accenture, IBM, Microsoft, Intel, Amazon, P&G, Bank of America\u00a0and Hewlett-Packard have all jumped on board.Related:\u00a05 Reasons Why It's a Bad Idea for Startups to Outsource Software DevelopmentThe list of fears surrounding digital outsourcing can be lengthy, but those fears can be alleviated. Below are four of the most common concerns regarding outsourcing software development and how to mitigate them to make outsourcing work for your business.Many business leaders have expressed concern about the hidden costs associated with outsourcing. Hidden costs include money wasted on unproductive operations abroad, money lost due to cultural differences, transition-related costs like temporary decreases in productivity\u00a0and the costs of managing the outsourced team.Luckily, good communication will do a lot to mitigate these costs. In addition to informal daily communication with your \"abroad\" team, schedule teleconferences or meetings regularly to discuss larger issues that might be hindering productivity or cohesion. The more you can get to know your abroad team, the better: You\u2019ll be able to verify that this particular team is the right fit for your company.You can also avoid hidden or extra costs by planning ahead. Establish clear productivity and team-building goals, and have the outsourced team commit to accomplishing those goals within a set period of time. Make milestones frequent and achievable by adjusting them as necessary.The fear of choosing the wrong vendor to handle your development needs is valid and common. However, you can take certain precautions to make sure you\u2019re happy with whom you choose.Related:\u00a0Should You Outsource Mobile SaaS Development?Pick your outsourced vendor wisely. Instead of just choosing the cheapest service, look into experience, success metrics, testimonials\u00a0and potential language barriers. Also, ensure that the vendor will be willing to work on your schedule. Depending on your project, close collaboration might be necessary; as such, you\u2019ll want your abroad team to operate on your local team\u2019s hours.Most importantly, don\u2019t be afraid to switch! One great thing about outsourcing development is that outsourcing opens the door to many viable options. If you\u2019re unsatisfied with the work product of your outsourced team, you can easily find another team for a comparable, or even lower, price.Another common fear is that leaders won\u2019t be able to ensure efficiency due to skill gaps between outsourced developers and local developers. Creating strong ties between the two groups, however, is an easy fix.Depending on the structure of your company, consider keeping a few skilled developers in-house. You can then implement systems to check the outsourced work as it is created, to avoid receiving a subpar work product.For example, re-compile and build your software every time a developer submits work for a \u00a0product. Doing this will help detect problems immediately so they can be remedied without delay. You can also require that outsourced team members develop and run individual tests for their products during development.Creating tests prior to the implementation of a feature can\u00a0help clarify what the software should ultimately do. These tests can then be run again and again throughout development. Testing needs to be automated and thorough, and the end-user experience should always be kept in mind.Collaboration is another valuable method to mitigate the skill gap. If possible, in addition to frequently communicating with your outsourced team members, strive to collaborate with them to better resolve potential problems that occur during development. Using Scrum is a great way to facilitate this collaboration.Finally, require that your outsourced team members create technical documentation so you can better understand their work. If you switch vendors in the future, you\u2019ll need the technical and architectural specifications for the tasks your current outsourced developers are working on to avoid future delays.Security is a concern for many developers who work with trade secrets and other types of private data, so it\u2019s imperative to take this into account when selecting a vendor. International certifications for data privacy exist, and most reputable vendors should meet the certification requirements.When choosing an outsourced vendor, look for past incidents regarding client security. How did the vendor handle it? How would you handle it? By considering possible security issues beforehand, you can avoid potential disaster later.Related:\u00a0Outsource Your App Development Effectively With These 5 TipsAJ Agrawal is the CEO and co-founder of Alumnify. an alumni-engagement platform.",

The rules reclassified broadband internet service providers as public utilities in an effort to create a more open internet, not weighted to those entities that could pay more to receive faster service.Led by Engine, Techstars and Y Combinator, more than 800 members of the tech community, including Chartbeat, Etsy, Medium and Matter Ventures, signed their names to an open letter protesting the move.Read the full letter below.Related:\u00a0FCC Chairman Pledges to Undo Net Neutrality RulesThe Honorable Ajit PaiChairman Federal Communications Commission445 12th Street SWWashington, DC 20554Chairman Pai:As a group of startups, entrepreneurs, investors, and the organizations who support them from all 50 states, we were excited to hear about your recent regional tour with startups and innovators and learn about your plans to drive better, faster broadband deployment across the U.S.During your tour, you noted that \"High-speed Internet access, or broadband, is giving rise to what I have called the democratization of entrepreneurship. With a powerful plan and a digital connection, you can raise capital, start a business, immediately reach a worldwide customer base, and disrupt an entire industry.\" We couldn\u2019t agree more. Each of our businesses is an example of the sort of innovation and investment that meaningful broadband access has fueled.But the success of America\u2019s startup ecosystem depends on more than improved broadband speeds. We also depend on an open Internet -- including enforceable net neutrality rules that ensure big cable companies can\u2019t discriminate against people like us. We\u2019re deeply concerned with your intention to undo the existing legal framework.Without net neutrality, the incumbents who provide access to the Internet would be able to pick winners or losers in the market. They could impede traffic from our services in order to favor their own services or established competitors. Or they could impose new tolls on us, inhibiting consumer choice. Those actions directly impede an entrepreneur\u2019s ability to \u201cstart a business, immediately reach a worldwide customer base, and disrupt an entire industry.\u201d Our companies should be able to compete with incumbents on the quality of our products and services, not our capacity to pay tolls to Internet access providers.Fortunately, in 2015 the Federal Communications Commission put in place light touch net neutrality rules that not only prohibit certain harmful practices, but also allow the Commission to develop and enforce rules to address new forms of discrimination. We are concerned by reports that you would replace this system with a set of minimum voluntary commitments, which would give a green light for Internet access providers to discriminate in unforeseen ways.Rather than dismantling regulations that allow the startup ecosystem to thrive, we urge you to focus instead on policies that would promote a stronger Internet for everyone. We applaud efforts to remove unnecessary barriers to construction of new networks, which would foster increased competition and faster, more affordable, open Internet access. We appreciate your consideration and stand at the ready to provide insights that support this work.Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

      "content": "With all the attention surrounding outsourcing, some might be surprised that it\u2019s lost a bit of steam recently.\u00a0According to an Information Services Group study, traditional outsourcing\u00a0fell 25 percent\u00a0during the last quarter of 2016, in comparison to the last quarter of 2015.Related:\u00a05 Things Small Businesses Should OutsourceThis dip, the industry\u2019s largest since 2009, raises important questions for small companies, most notably: Which tasks are worth keeping in house, and which ones should be doled out to the experts?Most companies wait until a round of funding comes through before outsourcing. Accounting and HR can afford that, but needs like legal consultation should go external from day one, no matter how much capital you have on hand.Going external helps efficiency.Some entrepreneurs fear outsourcing could have adverse internal effects -- specifically,outsourcing could impact a company\u2019s productivity.However, a\u00a0Deloitte survey\u00a0on global outsourcing positions outsourcing not only as an approach that doesn\u2019t dampen productivity, but one that also sparks innovation, which can further boost productivity. Fifty-nine percent of survey respondents said outsourcing reduces costs, 47 percent believed it\u2019s useful in finding unique ways to address capacity issues and 29 percent thought it boosts a company\u2019s chances to scale globally.With those three variables looming large in the productivity of any growing company, these numbers point to outsourcing as a trend startups should buy into. It\u2019s just a matter of figuring out how to make it work best for your company.Related:\u00a05 Tasks Entrepreneurs Are Better Off OutsourcingDeciding when\u00a0and what to outsource can seem tricky, but your primary objective should always be to keep production moving. These three tips can help your team make the most of outsourcing without losing any speed:1. Decide what\u2019s a must-have.\u00a0What\u00a0can\u00a0be outsourced successfully is occasionally a surprise. List what is -- and isn\u2019t -- mission-critical for your company, then decide on outsourcing from there.Related:\u00a0These 25 Successful Startups Were Built With Outsourced DevelopmentSlack founder Stewart Butterfield outsourced\u00a0the workplace messaging app\u2019s\u00a0development -- and the creation of its logo and website -- to an agency.\u00a0Butterfield and his team play-tested the design and tweaked it, based on feedback, before releasing it. Within two weeks of its release, Slack received 15,000 invitation requests; and DMR covered Slack\u2019s current stats, which showed the company at\u00a05 million\u00a0daily active users and counting.A great rule of thumb is for a startup team to have a clear understanding of what the company\u2019s mission is so resources can be preserved for that work. Spending time on this process on the front end will get the ball rolling and free up time on the back end.2. Adopt an old-school mindset.\u00a0Nothing beats a real-life recommendation when it comes to connecting with outsourced providers who can meet your needs without becoming a drain on the company. Our firm frequently receives referrals from startups that found out about us through other companies we\u2019ve worked with.Whether it\u2019s at a conference, a shared workspace or a happy hour, face-to-face networking with other founders is invaluable.\u00a0\u201cWho are you using for _______?\u201d\u00a0is an easy question to ask, and it may save you a lot of headaches in the long run.3. Leverage existing service providers.\u00a0Once you find a high-quality outsourced service provider, remember that the company can frequently offer resources in areas beyond its specialty. Asking these service providers whom they\u00a0work with can initiate unexpected solutions -- these service providers typically work across all industries because the operational foundations of many businesses are very similar.GitHub CIO Scott Chacon met the company\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Chris Wanstrath, at a chance meetup in San Francisco. Upon hearing about Chacon\u2019s knowledge of Git, Wanstrath brought him in as\u00a0a consultant\u00a0for what would eventually become Gist, a GitHub sharing feature.Related:\u00a0In-House or Outsourced?

      "content": "Since Facebook\u2019s 2017 F8 Developer Conference kicked off on Tuesday, the social media giant has made a raft of announcements about the new features it has in the works. From advances in augmented reality to virtual assistants, read on for the latest offerings from Mark Zuckerberg and company.During his keynote, Zuckerberg highlighted various forms of AR technology that could soon appear on our smartphones. He previewed tools that will allow users to place virtual objects in real places, such as a note on a refrigerator or artwork on blank white walls. In one demonstration, he showcased the ability to turn flat images into 3D scenes and overlay directions or set up a gameboard.Two tools within the Facebook app\u2019s camera are now available. AR Studio is in closed beta, and developers can apply for access to create effects based on object detection (think virtual steam billowing from a cup of coffee). Frame Studio is available to the public and allows users to create their own image filters and overlays.The company announced the beta launch of a social virtual reality app called Facebook Spaces. If you own an Oculus Rift headset, with the app, you can make a cartoon avatar of yourself, and you and three friends can virtually hang out in just about any setting you can imagine, from Paris to outer space.Related:\u00a0Why Mark Zuckerberg Is Excited About an Augmented Reality FutureFor those who have held off downloading the Messenger app until this point, it seems that Facebook is hoping to lure more users with the promise of a more multilevel experience. Messenger will soon integrate the ability to play games such as Words With Friends, and an Apple Music extension is on its way, on top of the current partnership with Spotify. Users can also look forward to a mobile payments function in Messenger for purchases such as event tickets.M, Facebook\u2019s answer to Siri or Alexa, will now be able to drop into users\u2019 conversations in Messenger. If someone asks a question about what to order for dinner, M can offer suggestions and then launch a window within the app where the user can make a purchase through a third party.Related:\u00a021 Hidden Facebook Features Only Power Users KnowAt F8, the company also launched Chat Extensions. Now in Messenger, a chat bot can be a group experience, rather than a one-on-one interaction. For example, a group might use theScore\u2019s bot to follow a game or Kayak\u2019s to make travel plans.Owing to Zuckerberg\u2019s goal of merging the digital and physical worlds, Facebook and Udacity are partnering to organize meetups in cities all over the country, where developers can learn new skills and work together.At the conference, Regina Dugan, the head of the company\u2019s research and development moonshot division Building 8, said that she and her team are currently working on a neural interface that would enable someone to type with just their mind -- up to 100 words per minute.Building 8 is also developing skin sensor technology that would essentially allow someone to hear through their skin. The team is at work on software and hardware that would make the skin mimic the way that the ear and brain process sound frequencies. This artificial cochlea would allow the brain to recognize symbols, words and patterns based on what a person touches.At F8, the company also rolled out a pair of Surround 360-degree cameras -- the x24 and x6. The cameras will be completed later this year. The company plans to license the technology to manufacturers in lieu of an open-source model. Last year, a 360-degree camera was announced at F8. It reportedly cost more than $25,000 to produce.Facebook laid out a few initiatives at F8 toward its goal of providing internet connectivity in places that do not currently have access. Tether-Tennas are tethered helicopters meant to act as a backup when natural disasters interrupt connections. Another program, the Terragraph project, uses antennas to close wireless coverage gaps in cities. The ongoing Aquila project is working on drones to provide internet connectivity.During the conference, Michael Abrash, the chief scientist at Oculus Research, made the prediction that by 2022, augmented reality glasses will be available to consumers, and they could eclipse the popularity of the cell phone.Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

      "content": "Though his title may be a mouthful, The Global Director of Platforms and Product Partnerships for Messenger at Facebook has a singular vision: to make technology that levels the playing field for every person, no matter what. Anand Chandrasekaran is doing just that with Messenger, helping to further develop strategies for Messenger that have been incredibly successful, including the integration of open-API chatbots into Messenger.Messenger, which has more than one billion monthly users and more than 100,000 active developers building bots and AI powered conversational experiences, is one of Chandrasekaran\u2019s passions. In his previous posts as CPO of Snapdeal and Bharti Airtel, Chandrasekaran was a leader at some of the world\u2019s leading enterprises, and his own experience launching successful startups has given him unique insight into what both developers and consumers want and need from the AI that is coming onto the market today.I meet Chandrasekaran at Shoptalk and in the first of an in-person, two-part interview, I asked Chandrasekaran to give me a look into what wisdom he\u2019s gleaned on bots, and how they will play a role in enterprise in the future.Related:\u00a0Top 10 Best Chatbot Platform Tools to Build Chatbots for Your BusinessNewlands: What is your opinion on how bots are functioning in today\u2019s marketplace, and what specifically stands out to you?\u00a0 Chandrasekaran: I think it\u2019s a very exciting time right now. As we took in all of the excitement about the platform, what we realized was: bots are not a one-size-fits-all use case. People want a variety of development options. What I mean by that is that businesses and developers want to know the customer really well, and then provide a great experience for them. For example, in the case of Gyant, they are a bot that offers a symptoms check for the Zika virus and offers other health-related information. They ask a lot of information to gain context, and sometimes they even ask for evidence or photos of the symptoms. Obviously, there are a lot of questions. But what they find is about 90% of the time, people who start on question number one get through all of the questions. This is one of the awesome things about Messenger platform experiences: you can make it super conversational while getting to know the customer.But not every experience requires this type of approach, like in the instance of airlines or telecom companies. They\u2019ve invested a lot in certain flows. They\u2019ve understood how their customers do what they do, and they\u2019ve mapped it out in terms of user experiences. Our goal is that the platform should empower them to leverage their existing infrastructure while still enabling them to build new and engaging experiences to make their customer interactions even better. So, today you can have a combination of a conversational and visual experience. For example, if someone wants to buy roses, they should be able to see a visual of flowers. But if you\u2019re just saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to a number of questions, then it\u2019s better to have conversational experience rather than open up something or having to click out of Messenger.What we are trying to do is give developers the canvas to build these creative opportunities. In messaging, what people find is while they like to be really expressive and share a lot of content, they also like the immediacy; the person asks a question and I just say \u201cyes.\u201d The answers to, \u201cWhat can a bot do,\u201d are becoming far broader now. It can be a great user experience for airlines, or a telephone company, or a sports team offering experiences to their users. We are also seeing a lot of celebrities using chatbots to build relationships with their fans. A lot of celebrities are becoming entrepreneurs in their own right, and they are building one-to-one relationships with their fans, which is not unlike a brand developing relationships with their loyal customers.Related:\u00a0How to Create a Facebook Messenger Chatbot For Free Without CodingNewlands:\u00a0What is your perspective on people selling through Messenger?Chandrasekaran:\u00a0We want to extend that opportunity to anyone who can benefit, though we feel very strongly about needing to set some guidelines on what constitutes a spammy experience for the consumers -- and that\u2019s probably the only thing that we have a strong opinion about. We want Messenger to be a place where people feel comfortable getting high-quality signals and high-quality communication. I think our stand will be strong in that area, and somewhat unwavering.Related:\u00a07 Ways\u00a0Chatbots\u00a0Can Benefit Your Marketing StrategyNewlands:\u00a0If a business wants to sign customers up for a user experience, but then wants to sell products, are you in favor of that?Chandrasekaran:\u00a0What we find is that selling a product to a consumer is a conversation. Nobody comes to any platform and just buys. They have some questions, they want to choose from a couple of options, they might want to check if it\u2019s the right size. Even in the real world, people like to have a conversation about what they are buying. In that regard, we feel that bots lend themselves nicely to a conversational user experience.In addition, there are only two options for consumers right now: the very low commitment experience of mobile web, and then the very high commitment experience of apps. For mobile web you don\u2019t need your users to do anything --\u00a0 they go to the page, but they\u2019re probably not logged in, their payment information is not there, and so on. On the high end, they\u2019ve got an app, and all their stuff is there, but it\u2019s a pretty high bar for someone to go download something and set it up. I think there is an intermediate experience, where people already have Messenger as do over a billion people, and already have a great\u00a0experience\u00a0on Messenger, so they are in between.Not to get very Goldilocks about it, but it\u2019s neither on one end of the spectrum or the other; it\u2019s just right in terms of level of level of commitment and user experience.Murray Newlands is an entrepreneur, investor, business advisor and speaker.

      "content": "Kevin Busque says he was confounded. He just couldn't understand it.It was 2012, and of all the employees at his company, TaskRabbit, he estimated that only around 34 percent had signed up for a 401(k). So he held an informal discussion with them to dig into this issue. It turned out, this group of Silicon Valley workers found the whole system too confusing.\"It was very clear the younger generation was not investing even though they were the ones that were really interested in savings,\" says Busque, who co-founded TaskRabbit with his wife, Leah. \"So there was an issue there, and it kind of smacked me in the face a few times. The system is completely broken.\"Related: The 10 Best Cities for RetirementSo he made it his goal to replace ADP, the company's 401(k) provider, with something digital that offered investment advice. But after searching for something like that on the internet, Busque says he came up empty. So he did what any entrepreneur would do: He decided to build his own solution.The result of those efforts is Guideline, an online-only 401(k) provider that launched last August after about two and a half years of work. The company spent the bulk of that time building a system to keep records, an essential part of any operation that deals in 401(k)s in terms of client privacy and legal compliance. Guideline charges an upfront $500 fee then $8 per participant a month, and it integrates employees' plans with a business's payroll provider and has an opt-out system, contrary to many traditional firms' confusing opt-in processes.According to Busque, the model is already a huge success. Guideline is bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars every month and is \"almost forking over to profitability.\" It's also the exclusive 401(k) provider for Gusto, the unicorn payroll company.\u201cKevin is a remarkable entrepreneur -- visionary and humble at the same time,\" says Tomer London, chief product officer and co-founder of Gusto. \"We love working with him as he\u2019s truly committed to enabling more people to save towards better retirement.\"Related: 3 Steps to Secure a Rich RetirementBusque is not alone in his goal: Captain401, ForUsAll and Money Intelligence also aim to use technology to simplify 401(k)s. Honest Dollar hopes to do the same with IRAs. Feex says it helps people root out fees in their retirement accounts. There are also startups that help people invest, such as Stash and Betterment.To grasp the appeal of these startups, it's important to understand the main players in the 401(k) industry, such as Great-West Financial, ADP and Fidelity. Employers enroll for their services, and employees can sign up for an account based on their employer's HR policies. For plans that require employees to opt in, participation rates hover around 69 percent for businesses with 100 or more employees and 36 percent for smaller companies. Plans with automatic enrollment see much greater participation.Anyone who's ever had to sign up for a 401(k) knows how confusing it can be.\"To be honest, nobody takes finance classes other than nerds like me,\" Tim Guilford, a registered principal at Raymond James Financial Services, told USA Today. \"So when you're presented on your first day of work with a list of all our funds and asked how much you want to put in our plan, people are poorly equipped to make those decisions.\"And because many 401(k) providers aren't allowed to offer financial advice, many people just choose options that sound good. Meanwhile, the firms also take in fees, which has led to several lawsuits. And they don't even have to work in your best interests, as President Donald Trump delayed an Obama administration rule that would have required financial institutions to do so. (Last Week Tonight With John Oliver did a digestible segment on the industry's problems.)Guideline recommends plans not only based on your age, but your family status and where you live. The app will ask you about life changes every year. It's a solution built for today's internet consumers, or \"the most employee-focused 401(k) for small business,\" as Busque puts it.Related: This Startup Aims to Help Older Professionals Find Jobs\"I like to solve problems with technology,\" he says. \"[Businesses] don't know that they have access to great 401(k)s and participants want great 401(k)s with low fees. They don't trust banks. They don't trust brokers. We're not either of those. We have to do what's in the best interest of the plan participant.\"He sees Guideline, which employs about 35 people, as a software company that is \"B2B2C.\" And while the ethos in Silicon Valley is to disrupt industries, Busque says that wasn't the right approach with Guideline.Stephen J.

Nowhere has that journey been more dramatic than in the wired heart of San Francisco\u2019s high-tech universe, where the San Francisco Giants have excelled on several fronts.Last season,\u00a0the team hit a major milestone and moved just behind the Boston Red Sox to steal the second-longest sellout streak in Major League Baseball from the Cleveland Indians, selling out 456 consecutive regular-season games at AT&T Park.\u00a0What\u2019s more widely known are the team's\u00a0World Series wins in 2010, 2012 and 2014, and while we\u2019re about to kickoff an \u201codd year\u201d the 2017 squad has back many of the star players that brought\u00a0them victory in years past. What\u2019s more,\u00a0 even in the down years when the team wasn\u2019t winning the pennant, the Giants sold every seat. Since opening the new ballpark doors in 2000, the team has welcomed more than 50 million fans.Related: 5 Essentials For Connecting With Your Ideal Target Market on Social MediaThe Giants have done it by appointing executives with a keen sense of product-market fit, such as SVP and CIO Bill Schlough, who became the first CIO ever appointed by a professional sports team when he joined the Giants in April 1999. I recently had the chance to speak with Schlough, who shared lessons he\u2019s learned over the years. He covered the intricacies involved in fostering a brand that maintains one of the most loyal fan bases in sports today. Many of Schlough\u2019s lessons translate for startup founders building their target audience and customer base in highly competitive markets.The Giants don\u2019t only compete on the field, Schlough said. \u201cWe think of ourselves as a member of several markets: baseball, broadcast, entertainment, real estate. But, ultimately, we\u2018re in the happiness business. Our product is bringing joy to our fans.\u201dOf course, different people have very different ideas of what joy is -- and not everyone who goes to a Giants game is there solely for the joy of baseball. As Schlough noted, \u201cIf we just focused on baseball fans, we\u2019d sell 15,000 to 20,000 tickets each game. There\u2019s much more to it than that.\u201dThere\u2019s garlic fries, of course. There\u2019s Wi-Fi (the Giants were the first team to install it). There are craft beers and a new \u201cvirtual reality experience.\u201d Additionally, there are special events that target specific demographics, such as Jerry Garcia Tribute Night, Cancer Awareness Night and Yoga Day. There is a Star Wars Day and even a Peanut Allergy Friendly Day. In all, there are 33 special days and nights that attract fans that otherwise might not buy a ticket to a baseball game.

      "content": "When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg took the stage today to open F8, the social giant\u2019s annual developer conference, he wanted to address the elephant in the room. Another big tentpole event named F8 had already kind of stolen his thunder: the recent premiere of his buddy Vin Diesel\u2019s latest movie, the eight installment of the Fast and the Furious franchise.Moving on to his main focus, Zuckerberg shared with the crowd Facebook\u2019s mission going forward, riffing quite literally on the\u00a0comprehensive treatise he published in February (he held up a sizable stack of paper that may or may not have been the printed open letter). The Facebook founder said the company's next steps would be to bring the digital and physical together and to \u201cwork on building common ground.\u201dTo that end, Facebook\u2019s next technological leap, now that it is the owner of four out of the five most downloaded apps in the world, is to step into the world of augmented reality. But Facebook isn\u2019t the only company with designs on augmented reality.Related: Watch Mark Zuckerberg 3-D-Print a Mini Version of His DogThis week, Snap rolled out an AR feature that lets users add special effects to their photos, in addition to the already popular face mask effects, according to The Wall Street Journal. Other major companies dipping into AR include Microsoft, Google and Apple.Zuckerberg announced that today will see the beta launch of an open AR platform through a new camera function of the app that will allow developers to create their own filters and frames.He also shared what future AR innovations could look like. He offered an example of a still photo that could be transformed into a 3D scene, where the user could pan around, change lighting and add effects such as filling the room with water, bouncing balls or skittles.Related: Watch Mark Zuckerberg Ask Fellow Harvard Dropout Bill Gates for Advice on His Harvard Commencement SpeechZuckerberg spoke about transforming blank walls into street art and how AR could be used to leave notes for friends in specific places, such as marking a table at your favorite bar or leaving a note for your spouse on the refrigerator.\u201cThis is going to be an important technology that changes how we use our phones,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cThere is a long road map of technology to build for years. I am confident that we are going to push this augmented reality platform forward.\u201d That long road map included creating glasses and eventually contacts to see the world through an augmented reality lens.Meanwhile, the Facebook CEO took a moment to offer his and the company\u2019s condolences to the family of Robert Godwin, Sr., whose alleged killer posted a video of his murder on the social network and then confessed in a live video.

      "content": "In mixed reality technology, which includes virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), there are some companies that you cannot avoid watching. They include most of the world\u2019s biggest, richest and most innovative personal tech companies.\u00a0This group includes Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Sony, Nintendo, Huawei\u00a0and others. I think the most important company to watch is Apple, who will begin to announce a myriad of devices all connecting to its new iPhone. This will trigger a rapid escalation of AR and VR adoption.That said, I see all sorts of categories that are ripe for the private sector and early-phase companies to enjoy rapid and significant growth. In many of these niches, there is more than one promising player.Related: Virtual Reality Is About to Change Your BusinessI asked experts Robert Scoble and Shel Israel of the Transformation Group, LLC, a consulting firm dedicated to helping big brands develop and implement mixed reality (MR) strategies, to help me examine the hundreds of mixed reality organizations to uncover the best positioned and the wherewithal to scale quickly.Mark Zuckerberg has called VR the most social platform he has ever seen, and we agree. It is different and far more experiential than social media. It allows people located all over the world\u00a0to share experiences in a single virtual space. This can range from playing games,\u00a0to touring historic points of interest,\u00a0to new forms of distance learning, to corporate training experiences.There are five companies that we believe show promise in this area:Every aspect of entertainment is embracing mixed reality:\u00a0players, fans and sponsors. Some niches, such as playing games, have been obvious to most observers. Others are not so obvious.Music. In mixed reality, people think mostly about 3D visual experiences. But, there is also stereoscopic music, which enables listeners to be immersed in the middle of the band or orchestra pit. MicrodoseVR provides one of the wildest experiences we know. As the company name implies it is like being on a small dose of LSD, as the music hits you from all sides, vivid 3D imagery shapeshifts in time to the music all around you, and you undulate to the beat with others who may be in their living rooms thousands of miles away.Sports. Mixed reality is being used to enhance fan experiences of just about every sport including the NBA, NFL and the PGA. The companies to watch are the startups that are gaining traction at delivering mixed reality experiences to fans on a global level. The one that so far impresses us the most is NextVR, which partners with Fox, the NBA, CNN and others to provide AR fan experiences in major sports. For example, fans can watch an NBA VR Game of the Week.\u00a0Related: 7 New Opportunities Virtual Reality May CreateSearch remains the most popular application in the current 2D, but as the people behind Google and Bing search are aware search changes dramatically when it moves into immersive technologies. Internal mapping is allowing people to find all the blue jeans available in a mall, perhaps while shoppers are escorted by the virtual celebrity of their choice.In fact, it is far bigger than that. Every square centimeter of the planet is being 3D mapped. It is the core of the great transformation that moves us from smartphones to smart glasses. It also makes search more visual. We will search for things by image so that barriers of language disappear. A company we are watching is Sketchfab, an NYC-based startup that allows people to search for and share more than a million 3D objects through use of a VR headset. Each object can be rotated to allow the searcher to look\u00a0at an object from all possible perspectives.Related: 5 Startup Ideas for Jumping Into Virtual RealityWhile they are a small step short of being VR or AR, 360\u00b0 cameras have shrunk from over $10,000 to under $100 in just a few short years. These cameras can now be clipped onto your smartphone, where an app allows you to become the center of a photo that surrounds you in all six directions.\u00a0These cameras\u00a0are constantly improving in quality and affordability. They have not yet become a commodity, but they are well on their way. The four we like the best: Insta360, which has cameras ranging from $3500 down to $129; Giroptic, which is praised for ease of use; JauntVR for the cinematically inclined; and our favorite, 8i, which is leading in volumetric human capture, a technology that makes virtual humans increasingly lifelike.The headsets of tomorrow are the equivalent of the smartphone of today. Like phones, the componentry is vital to the product, particularly important is the quality of optics, and Lumus seems to be making the best. They could become the \u201cIntel Inside\u201d of the next generation of hardware.Of course, the big players will dominate in the headset area. As we stated, we expect Apple to be a big winner in his area. But, it will not be the only winner, and some of the players may not be brands you know today.\u00a0Related: How Augmented Reality Will Shape the Future of EcommerceThere are two headset companies, you may not have heard of that we would definitely watch.ODG\u00a0is the first commercially successful AR headset company.\u00a0Founded before the turn of the century, the San Francisco-based, privately held company is working on its eighth generation headset and is the product of choice for many enterprises and government organizations, particularly the military. We would not be surprised for it to cut a deal for a consumer-level headset in the next two to three years.\u00a0We are also optimistic about the future of Meta. The Israeli-born company, now located in Silicon Valley, has raised nearly $200 million, most notably from Lenovo. We recently saw a preview of the not-yet-announced Meta3 and were impressed on several levels. This is another company focused now on enterprise customers that just might find its way onto the retail shelf -- perhaps via Lenovo.\u00a0We also see a bright future for Daqri, a more recently started headset company that serves hardhat applications ranging from construction to oil rigs to jet fighter pilots and perhaps someday into football or motorcycle racing. The AR helmets are\u00a0tough\u00a0and relatively lightweight.\u00a0Related: How This Augmented Reality Company Hopes to Compete With Microsoft and GoogleAs we move from handsets to headsets, we will interact with devices in new ways, leaving the hands mostly free to do other things. There will be voice as AI devices that we call Digital Genies come to market.But, now we have LeapMotion,\u00a0a company to watch because it is the leading provider of headset technology that lets people do what they wish by natural gestures, operated by natural gestures.\u00a0We would have also included Eyefluence as a company to watch, but Google bought the company, which has moved into Google facilities and is tight-lipped about its next moves.Gestures and eye interaction are technologies for the near-term future. There are also companies that are helping people interact with technology directly through brainwaves and mixed reality. Mindmaze is the furthest along. With over a billion dollars in investment backing, the Swiss company uses customized headsets to treat or eventually cure such traumatic issues as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, stroke and the pain caused by traumatic loss of limbs.Mark Fidelman is a globally recognized marketing leader with a focus on influencer marketing and mixed reality.

      "content": "In my opinion, the next hotbed of innovation is Africa, specifically the nations of South Africa, Rwanda\u00a0and Kenya. Numerous industries are being disrupted at the moment, from the African mobile money market -- the undisputed leader of which is Kenyan startup M-Pesa --\u00a0to job hunting, by South Africa\u2019s Giraffe, a mobile recruitment app for low-income workers without internet, but with smartphones.Yet the largest revolution that\u2019s sweeping across the continent\u2019s emerging markets is in renewable energy, specifically solar power. Today, solar is growing so quickly that\u00a0of the nearly 600 million Africans living off-grid, experts estimate that approximately 10 percent\u00a0are using clean, renewable energy to power their homes.Related: 11 African Entrepreneurs Who Are Changing the Business LandscapeSo how did solar come to dominate Africa so thoroughly? And specifically, what lessons can American business owners learn from the ingenious, resourceful entrepreneurs operating in the challenging conditions of the African continent? Plenty, as it turns out.Without a doubt, solar energy faces considerable obstacles, not only in Africa, but internationally as well. The biggest barrier may well be integration into existing infrastructure, particularly power grids, which may not be able to accommodate the variability of solar\u00a0-- cloudy days produce less power, for example.African solar startups have taken this reality into consideration. They understand that building large solar farms, then connecting homes with extensive power grids is a lengthy undertaking that, absent public and government backing, can take years, if not decades. Instead, entrepreneurs have seized upon decentralization, skipping big infrastructure to bring power directly to the people.Take M-Kopa, arguably the leader in African solar energy. The company\u2019s bundle, which costs $35, provides a solar panel, multi-device charger, several charging cables, lights, radio\u00a0and a SIM card for mobile payment. M-Kopa has already sold 300,000 kits across Kenya, Uganda\u00a0and Tanzania, leapfrogging extant power grids entirely and empowering their customers. Now that\u2019s not to say that big solar farms don\u2019t exist; rather, they\u2019re far less prevalent, and much less important, than the small-scale, personalized touch of a startup like M-Kopa.The lesson here? Rather than relying on large, centralized networks, devise a decentralized, low-cost solution that could reach hundreds of thousands of households. One such example is Blockstack, a startup that uses the encryption-based technology Blockchain to guarantee anonymity while surfing the web.Related to the above tenet of decentralization, it\u2019s important to note that while government subsidies and intervention can help your business, such assistance may never come.This is doubly true when it comes to many African nations. Consider this -- in 2014, Transparency International estimated that nearly 75 million Africans were forced to pay bribes\u00a0-- often for access to basic services like water, sanitation\u00a0and yes, electricity. Furthermore, poverty and bribery are inextricably linked, and\u00a0as a result, those who pay the most bribes are also those least able to afford it.Related: From Bootstrapped Startup to More than $1 Million in Annual RevenueWith that in mind, two entrepreneurs founded Juabar, a Tanzanian franchise centered around small, solar-powered kiosks that offer cell phone charging. Rather than wait for the government to build the requisite infrastructure, Juabar\u2019s two founders simply stepped in and created a network of solar powered, micro-entrepreneurs. Such franchise owners earn, on average, between $75-150 per month, in a nation where the monthly average is around $45 per month. In the future, Juabar plans to offer Wi-Fi and other information services.The lesson here? At the risk of getting political, it\u2019s true that certain, well-established industries receive a lot of funding and subsidies from the government. But if you\u2019re an underdog, don\u2019t despair. Even if the government ignores your industry in favor of those with powerful lobbies, you still have a fighting chance. How? Use low-tech, decentralized solutions, start at the grassroots level, and remember to...Given that disruption is the mantra for the digital age, this one should come as no surprise. To return to the case of M-Kopa, the startup\u2019s success --\u00a0a $19 million round of funding in 2015\u00a0--\u00a0owes a lot to the convergence of two factors.First, consider that solar panels have been declining in cost. In America alone, the price of solar panels has dropped by 5 percent\u00a0for residential households, and 12 percent\u00a0for large-scale solar farms. Further, some reports estimate that the costs of solar energy will drop 60 percent\u00a0by 2040, to three cents per kilowatt hour, which is far cheaper than gas or coal in many areas.Second, recall the earlier mention of Africa\u2019s burgeoning mobile payments market, led by startups like Kenya\u2019s M-Pesa. Developed by Vodafone and its African partner Safaricom, M-Pesa revolutionized the payment landscape, allowing users to pay off anything from cab rides to M-Kopa\u2019s solar energy bills. In fact, MIT researchers have found that services like M-Pesa improve access to capital by the poor and increase their consumption -- a boon to startups like M-Kopa.The lesson here? Leverage existing and emerging\u00a0tech to carry out your core business better, faster\u00a0and cheaper than the competition.Financing is something of a dilemma. Without a solid financing plan, potential customers won\u2019t be able to buy your product or service. But if your plan is perceived as unfair, you\u2019re likely to lose customers.Take a look at Off Grid Electric, another solar energy startup that\u2019s quite similar to M-Kopa. Rather than force their customers to pay off loans at exaggerated interest rates, OGE charges its customers $7 a month for services. After three years, customers own their own unit. Considering that it costs around $100-140 per year for kerosene lamps and candles, users can save a lot of money by paying off their OGE unit within three years.Related: 5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Worldwide Can Learn From Israeli CultureThe lesson here? Balance company profits with customer interest to provide a win-win situation for everyone. After all, happy customers are repeat customers, and you can bet that both OGE and M-Kopa have ancillary products to offer.Ultimately, given the numerous challenges that African solar energy startups face, it\u2019s logical that they would have much to teach entrepreneurs the world over. Ultimately, their most important lesson may well be the vital role of creativity. After all, without a forward-thinking vision and the courage to challenge existing circumstances, none of these innovative companies would exist today.Dr. Ping Jiang is one of the world\u2019s foremost macro traders, due to his successful track record of investing in emerging markets and undervalued investment vehicles.

      "content": "The latest autonomous robots to hit the streets with food delivery orders are from Marble, a San Francisco startup that is partnering with Yelp to navigate crowded city streets and deliver your pad thai before it gets cold.Marble's robots are about waist-height, a bit larger than the dog-sized models of its competitor\u00a0Starship. They're also brimming with technology borrowed from self-driving cars. Each Marble delivery bot -- there are a few of them cruising the streets of San Francisco's Mission and Potrero Hill neighborhoods -- includes lidar, cameras\u00a0and ultrasonic sensors to monitor their surroundings.The idea is that they can avoid pedestrians and safely use crosswalks by relying on the sensor data to locate themselves on the super-accurate 3D maps that Marble is building. The company says it plans to map the majority of San Francisco's sidewalks over the coming year. That map-assisted approach is the same approach that many automakers are taking for self-driving cars, too, including Cadillac's upcoming\u00a0Super Cruise\u00a0system.Visitors and San Francisco residents can order delivery from Yelp's Eat24 app for a chance to be served by a Marble bot. If you're selected, you'll be offered the opportunity to accept the service\u00a0and the restaurant will then pack your order into one of the robots' cargo bays. Once it arrives, you'll enter an access code to unlock your breakfast, lunch\u00a0or dinner.Although delivery robots are still relatively rare, the Marble-Yelp partnership comes as the technology is ripening and the market is heating up. In January, Starship announced\u00a0partnerships\u00a0with DoorDash and Postmates to deliver food and other goods within a four-mile range. Last month, Starship also began\u00a0delivering pizza\u00a0from Domino's locations in Germany and the Netherlands. If those trials are successful, Domino's could expand the service to more of its 2,000-plus\u00a0stores worldwide.Tom is PCMag's San Francisco-based news reporter.\u00a0",

      "content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Entrepreneur\u2019s \u201c20 Questions\u201d series features both established and up-and-coming entrepreneurs and asks them a number of questions about what makes them tick, their everyday success strategies and advice for aspiring founders.In the intense world of Silicon Valley, your stock rise and falls by the state of your startup. And for those founders who don\u2019t make it their number one focus, they are often judged harshly.That is something Randi Zuckerberg learned first hand, first as the head of marketing at Facebook during the social media giant\u2019s early years, and then as the CEO and founder of her own marketing firm, Zuckerberg Media.\u201cWhat is life without being a three dimensional person? It\u2019s so boring,\u201d she says of the people who believe a startup should be the only thing on your plate. \u201cHow can you tell someone to put away the things they are passionate about?\u201dIn addition to running Zuckerberg Media, she is a speaker, radio host on SiriusXM and the author of bestselling business and children\u2019s books -- Dot Complicated and Missy President.She is also a lifelong student of technology and explores how it has impacted our lives through her 5-year-old online community, which is also called Dot Complicated. And in 2014, she achieved her childhood dream of making her Broadway debut.We caught up with Zuckerberg and asked her 20 Questions to see what makes her tick.1. How do you start your day?I start my day with a little bit of a cheesy mantra that I\u2019ve been using for about 10 years. It says, \u201cwork, sleep, fitness, family, friends -- pick three.\u201d There is a lot of pressure, especially on women, to do everything well, every single day. I like to give myself permission to do three things really well each day, and it can be a different three tomorrow, as long as it all balances out in the long run.2. How do you end your day?In my ideal mind, I want to do something relaxing, like meditation or yoga. In reality, I\u2019m in bed on social media, on my laptop and on my phone all at the same time. That\u2019s an area of my life that I\u2019m actively trying to work towards. I know that sleep and relaxation is so important, but I would consider myself a work in progress when it comes to the end of the day habits.3. What\u2019s a book that changed your mind and why?Me, Myself and Us by Dr. Brian Little. I struggled for a long time because I\u2019m really an introvert, but I have to act extrovertedly, because I\u2019m giving speeches or meeting with entrepreneurs. I felt very alone in the world and then Dr. Little came out with this book about being pseudo extrovert, and it was all about introverts that have to pretend to be extroverts for their business lives.It totally changed my life and opened up a whole world of thinking for me. The book said if you go out there and have to act extraverted, don\u2019t forget you\u2019re an introvert at the core, which means you\u2019re going to need to build in downtime to your schedule, otherwise you're going to burn out. We don\u2019t run on the same kind of social energy that extroverts do. So I know that if I have a day where I am on camera or giving a talk, I\u2019ll actually build \u201cdo not schedule\u201d blocks of time into my calendar. That\u2019s not something I would have done before his book, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s really effective in my business and personal life4. What\u2019s a book you always recommend and why?Year of Yes by Shonda Rhimes. It\u2019s an awesome book. She\u2019s an incredible woman and I think that we can all get out of our comfort zone a little more.5. What\u2019s a strategy to keep focused?I like to carve out blocks of time that I\u2019m going to be unplugged, which is sometimes frustrating to the rest of my team. But I find that it\u2019s hard to do creative, thoughtful tasks when you are interrupted by emails and text messages. I like to carve out two to three hours, where I do a deep dive into writing a piece or working on a speech. That is the most effective hours of my entire day.Related: This Founder Shares the Mindset That Helps Her Stay On Track6. When you were a kid what did you want to be when you grew up?For a while, I wanted to be a mermaid, but apparently that was not a tangible goal. I really wanted to sing on Broadway. That was my big goal my entire life. I eventually gave it up to go into something reasonable, like technology and entrepreneurship.7. What did you learn from the worst boss you ever had?I learned about how to treat people, but I also learned that is is better to give people feedback in the moment. Early in my career, I had these bosses that would check in with me every six months -- and tell me for last six months that I\u2019ve been doing x, y and z and that\u2019s not good. I\u2019d sit there thinking, \u201cWhy didn't you tell me six months ago, so that I wasn\u2019t just making the same mistakes?\u201d That impacted my own management style, because I always want to give feedback in the moment.8. Who has influenced you most when it comes to how you approach your work?I\u2019m so lucky to have a great mentor in Kathleen Kennedy, who is the president of LucasFilm. She\u2019s given me great advice on what happens when you\u2019re the only woman in the room, and how to find mentorship and peer guidance around you even if you have to look in other industries.We\u2019ve definitely spoken about the fact that sometimes your best mentors are right around you, and you don\u2019t even know. A lot of times we look for someone high above us to be a mentor, but often peer-mentor groups are actually going to be the most effective and helpful.9. What\u2019s a trip that changed you?About a year ago, I traveled to Kuwait. I spoke at one of the first women in business conferences they had in the entire country. It really opened my eyes and challenged my viewpoint. I met some wonderful entrepreneurs that I\u2019m still in touch with on social media. I feel really grateful for that opportunity, and it made me realize that I need to take more trips like that to get out of my own bubble and to expand my view of entrepreneurship in different regions in the world.10. What inspires you?Definitely art, theater, culture. Anytime that I want to feel inspired I go to the theater. I spent so much time in my life building platforms, and it\u2019s easy for techies to forget that platforms are nothing without art to go on them.Related: The Co-Founder of Gilt on What Her First Job at Ebay Taught Her About Running a Company11. What was your first business idea and what did you do with it?A snow-shoveling subscription service when I was in middle school. I grew up in New York, and I was making a little bit of pocket money shoveling our own walkway. I then thought, what if I went door to door and say, here\u2019s my price for today, or you could pre-order for the entire season. If it snows a lot you\u2019ll get a good deal, but it if it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s the risk you take. I had a few houses our block that took me up on it, mostly because the cute neighborhood kid had an idea, but now I see all the subscription services out there, and I think I was a little\u00a0ahead of my time.12. What was an early job that taught you something important or useful?My dad is a semi-professional bridge player, and from a very young age, I used to be an assistant at the bridge club. It was fun, except it gets really stressful during certain times of the match when everyone needs to say their scores at the same time and pretty much every person raises their hand and calls for the caddy, and you have to run like a frantic animal collecting scores. Very early on it taught me about time management, how to deal with difficult and impatient people and how to pace myself and enjoy the downtime between the craziness..13. What\u2019s the best advice you ever took?Someone once told me, when we were talking about how easy it is to Google yourself and go on social media and see what they are saying about you, they said to me, \u201cyou know what Randi, you\u2019re never as good as they say you are, and you\u2019re never as bad as they say you are. You can\u2019t let it get to your head or your heart.\u201d14. What's the worst piece of advice you ever got?Someone once told me to be less interesting. I think they meant it in a constructive way, because in Silicon Valley there is a culture that you have to be 24/7 invested in your startup, otherwise you\u2019re not taken seriously. It\u2019s a very \u201call in\u201d culture, especially if you\u2019re a woman. People already expect you to be distracted by your family, so you need to go even more down that road to show you\u2019re all in.I always loved theater and art, so I got some advice to be less interesting, because they felt like people might think I was distracted if they knew I also had an interest in theater. It took me a few years to realize that was probably the worst piece of advice I had ever been given.\u00a015. What\u2019s a productivity tip you swear by?I swear by Evernote and note-taking apps. I\u2019m constantly writing notes to myself and sharing them with my team and my husband. With email I respond either instantly or never. If I\u2019m sitting there I can respond right away, but if I walk away, I get buried by a hundred more emails that come in. I wouldn\u2019t be able to function without it.Related: This Founder Shares the Secret to How to Make Your Business Last16. Is there an app or tool you use in a surprising way to get things done or stay on track?It\u2019s old school, but I set a lot of alarms during the day, like for when when I want to be done with something. Sometimes I follow them, sometimes I don\u2019t, but it does bring mindfulness into my day.17. What does work-life balance mean to you?To me, it\u2019s a long-term goal. A lot of people put pressure on themselves to make it a short-term, everyday goal. I like to give myself permission to be lopsided on a given day.18. How do you prevent burnout?I have two toddlers, and I\u2019m on the road over 100 days a year for work. It\u2019s really easy to put yourself last. I found that I was always thinking about work and then rushing to be home for my family. So self care was at the bottom of my priority list. If you don\u2019t carve out time for yourself, you\u2019re not going to be good to anyone else in your life.Now I block out those do not schedule chunks. I\u2019m the only one that is going to create those boundaries for myself and my time, not anyone else. I would definitely encourage more entrepreneurs to not feel bad or guilty about doing things like that.19. When you\u2019re faced with a creativity block, what\u2019s your strategy to get innovating?I just try to force myself to sit and write -- even if what I write is nonsense, and I end up throwing it out. Creativity and writing is a muscle, and you need to discipline yourself to actually sit and write ideally at the same time every day to get used to it. Before you know it, if you keep going, you\u2019re going to write something. I was able to write my whole business book in less than a month, because I decided that I was going to write four to six hours every day.20. What are you learning now? For me, I even see social media and technology as constant education. The tech is changing so quickly for someone like me. If I didn\u2019t constantly work to keep educating myself, I wouldn't even be hired as a junior social-media manager today. \u00a0I\u2019m constantly in a state learning, researching what\u2019s going on, what the innovations are, what the social media platforms are doing. There is not day that goes by that I don\u2019t try to educate myself in tech.Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

      "content": "Many startups spend huge amounts of money on advertising, yet neglect app store optimization. App store optimization is the most cost-effective method to organically increase your installs for a couple of reasons:Here are a few\u00a0tips and tricks:\u00a0The title of your app ranks more heavily than the rest of the meta-data, so choose it wisely. Make sure you target words in your title that you want to hit the most, words that you're confident about. Tools like SensorTower\u00a0and AppAnnie can provide you accurate traffic volumes and difficulties of certain keywords. Also, make sure you don\u2019t keyword stuff the title; the app store will reject your app.Related: How Can App Makes Improve Revenue and Keep Users Engaged?Depending on how many downloads and how much traffic your app is already getting, you must adjust your keywords. For example, if your app is already getting high traffic and downloads, you can target more competitive keywords that have higher traffic. If you are just starting up an app that nobody knows about and isn\u2019t getting featured, I recommend choosing keywords that have a low difficulty level and medium traffic (according to analytic tools like SensorTower or AppAnnie). There are likely some keywords that are gems that others are not targeting and may have decent traffic.As every app store is separated geographically by country, it is really wise to localize your app to optimize it for discovery across different languages. The app store allows you to change the meta-data within your app depending on which country is searching for your app. Some companies have used a mixture of Google translate and native speakers to help localize their apps, so it shouldn't be too difficult for you to localize as well. Localization is a huge aspect of having an effective presence globally. Just think of all these untapped markets that you can reach and how easily you could acquire more users with these markets. \u00a0Related: The Top 5 Myths of Mobile Apps -- And Why Believing Them Will Hurt Your BusinessOnce people are able to discover your app, the rest is up to how well your app listing converts into downloads. To optimize conversions, you must use beautiful images to entice users to want to download your app. Make sure to include the most attractive aspects of your app and to include captions in the pictures as well. You\u2019d be surprised at how a simple tweak of an image or word can translate in terms of conversion percentages.When was the last time you downloaded an app that had one star? Ratings and reviews don\u2019t factor in as much to discovery as the keywords and the title, but they do have a huge impact on conversion rates. Users are probably more likely to download your app if it has received a large number of positive reviews. Make sure to also include an interesting and enticing\u00a0description to explain to users what your app does!Related: 10 Steps to Building an App People Will LoveApp store optimization is an ongoing process that takes experience, time\u00a0and testing to get right. Make sure to thoroughly test out keywords over periods of time, and also test out the images/description of your app to see which ones are converting the best.\u00a0At the end of the day, data doesn't lie, so\u00a0make sure you follow the data and find out what works for your app specifically.Andrew Tang is the founder and CEO of Keybloc.

      "content": "Despite nationwide venture funding hitting a multiyear low, venture capital deployed to artificial intelligence startups has reached a record high.Last year, VCs struck 658 deals with AI companies, nearly five times the number that signed on the dotted line four years before. To date, the market contains 2,045 AI startups and more than 17,000 market followers, with more joining by the day.Related: How Artificial Intelligence Startups Struck GoldAI\u2019s rapid rise has swept up startups and enterprises alike, including U.S. automaker Ford, which recently bought AI startup Argo for $1 billion. The acquisition cements experts\u2019 suspicions of Ford\u2019s coming foray into self-driving technology. Other startups -- so many, in fact, that entrepreneurs need a \u201cbest of\u201d guide -- are betting heavily on bot platforms.So while we\u2019ve just glimpsed the tip of this innovation iceberg, it\u2019s clear AI is no longer some nebulous technology of the future. Sixty-eight percent of marketing executives, according to media research firm Weber Shandwick, report using AI in their operations. For a technology that only went mainstream in 2016 and barely existed four years ago, that\u2019s a remarkable adoption rate. How, regardless of the platform you choose, can you join forward-thinking entrepreneurs and build your business with AI? So far, four ways stand out:A politician wouldn\u2019t dream of delivering a small-town stump speech to her urban constituents. Why? Because you\u2019ve got to know your audience. The same is true for entrepreneurs. Before you broadcast your message, you need to know who you\u2019re trying to reach.Node, an account-based intelligence startup, uses natural language processing -- a fancy term for teaching a computer to understand how we humans speak and write -- to develop customer profiles. Node is crunching vast swaths of data to connect the dots between marketers and the companies they\u2019re trying to reach.Once you have ample customer data -- Node uses data crawlers to scrape information from social media, news sites and more -- pair machine learning and natural language processing models to extract sentiments from unstructured data. Then, just as senators segment constituents into demographic groups, Node uses cluster analysis to sort clients\u2019 customers into like cohorts.Related:\u00a0Top 10 Best Chatbot Platform Tools to Build Chatbots for Your BusinessIf, heaven forbid, you forgot to tag your neighbor at last week\u2019s house party, Facebook was no doubt there to remind you of your error. How does Facebook know which of your friends you left untagged? It has gone all-in on an AI technique called convolutional neural networks.Convolutional neural networks, which loosely model how the brain\u2019s visual cortex interacts with the eyes, work by separating an image into tiny portions before running each of those specks through a multilayered filter. It then \u201csees\u201d where each speck overlaps with other parts of the image, and through automated iterations, it puts together a full image.Many different ways exist to apply this technology, but retail businesses can start with image classification. Try using a convolutional neural network to break down photos of your products posted online. The model can identify customer segments that frequently use your product, where they\u2019re using it and whether they commonly pair other products with yours. Essentially, this automated image analysis can show you how your products fit into customers\u2019 lives, allowing you to tailor your marketing materials to fit.Related:\u00a04 AI Technologies Impacting Business Operations Right NowSuccess on social media requires careful listening and quick action. When a social campaign isn\u2019t working, it\u2019s best to put it out of its misery quickly. On the other hand, when one strikes a chord with customers, doubling down pays dividends.But to do so, you need real-time insights about customers\u2019 reactions to your content. Fortunately, AI can take the emotional temperature of thousands of customers at once. Dumbstruck, a video-testing and analytics startup that I advise, has added natural language processing to its emotional analytics stack. This allows it to provide moment-by-moment insights into viewers\u2019 reactions to media. Dumbstruck\u2019s model grows stronger with each reaction analyzed, producing a program that perceives human emotions even better than some people can.Customer service is -- or should be, according to consumers -- the department that never sleeps. More than half of people, 50.6 percent to be precise, believe a business should be available 24/7 to answer their every question and concern. When asked whether businesses should be available via a messaging app, the \u201cyes\u201d votes jump to nearly two in three.Fortunately, bots don\u2019t sleep, eat or go off-script. A well-built bot can offer cost-effective, constant customer service. Of course, grooming your bot to serve customers requires front-end data -- ideally hundreds of thousands of example conversations -- but you can get started with a human-chatbot hybrid. With this approach, the bot answers run-of-the-mill questions, while a human takes over for the more complex ones. Then, as the data builds and the model matures, you can phase in full automation.Related: The New Reality: AI-Enhanced RelationshipsTaco Bell, for example, knows taco cravings come at all times of night. Its TacoBot takes customer orders via Slack chat. Ticketmaster, a popular concert ticket provider, also offers an automated chat widget that informs users about new events and provides order details.Artificial intelligence is not just the stuff of Netflix shows and sci-fi paperbacks.

      "content": "While companies such as\u00a0Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Samsung and HTC have invested billions of dollars into virtual reality, startup castAR co-founder Jeri Ellsworth sees an augmented reality future. Anyone who\u2019s played the 2016 hit mobile game Pokemon Go has had a taste of augmented reality, which blends virtual characters with the real world.Serial inventor and entrepreneur Ellsworth worked at Valve Software, helping to found and grow the hardware department. The hardware department teams went on to release other products including the HTC Vive and the Steam Box controller, while she\u00a0focused more on augmented reality. \u00a0Related:\u00a0 10 Amazing Uses of\u00a0Virtual RealityThat augmented reality platform allowed players to wear specially-designed glasses and use a wand to interact with holographic creations that came to life on a flat surface like a tabletop, much like a real-world version of the HoloChess concept introduced in the original Star Wars back in 1977.In 2013, Ellsworth decided to leave, and since Valve was focused on virtual reality, she asked Valve president and owner Gabe Newell if she and colleague/programmer Rick Johnson could take that still-early prototype technology with them. He agreed, and castAR was born.\u201cWhat I learned from working at Valve and some of the amazing people there was that the company is hyper-focused on the customer experience,\u201d Ellsworth said. \u201cAlmost every decision that\u2019s made is studied under the microscope of how it impacts the end-user experience.\u201dEllsworth has a solid track record of succeeding across multiple male-dominated industries. She dropped out of high school in her small hometown of Dallas, Ore.,\u00a0and decided to build and race cars -- with no experience.\u201cI\u2019ve always been an inventor and tinkerer since I was a kid,\u201d Ellsworth recalled. \u201cI was always dismantling everything in our home and making something different of things. My father was perpetually frustrated that any device he brought into the house was going to be dismantled.\u201dEllsworth has spent her career learning from mentors and putting in the work. She found a local machinist in Oregon to teach her how to weld in exchange for her cleaning up the shop. She spent six years designing, building, racing and selling custom racecars. She also spent time dirt track racing with her father and competed in the I5 Challenge.Related:\u00a07 Reasons You Need a\u00a0Mentor\u00a0for Entrepreneurial SuccessShe went from designing racecars to customizing PCs in the \u201890s, running her own retail store called Computers Made Easy.\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to run a\u00a0retail business or coordinate teams, but when I opened up my first store I had an insurance guy who came over at lunch and taught me how to run a business and work with employees and keep customers happy,\u201d Ellsworth said.Once the profit margins dropped for custom PCs, Ellsworth headed to Silicon Valley and began building semiconductors and tackling system-level engineering challenges at companies like Intersil, Ubicom, Rapport, and Zenverge. She designed complicated toys in the early 2000s like the all-in-one video game joystick C64 Direct-to-TV, which put her on the radar of the video game industry. It was ultimately her in-depth weekly science educational webcast with George Sanger, Fatman and Circuit Girl, which dove into tough engineering problems, that attracted Newell\u2019s attention.Ellsworth\u2019s success in every industry she\u2019s tackled has drawn the attention of very successful entrepreneurs.\u201cComing to Silicon Valley without a traditional education, it was mind-blowing the type of mentors I was able to learn from,\u201d Ellsworth said. \u201cSteve Wozniak and Lee Felstenstein took time to give me advice.\u201dRelated:\u00a0How\u00a0Augmented Reality\u00a0Will Shape the Future of EcommerceOne of those mentors along her journey was Andy Rubin, who she first met at Danger Inc. When Ellsworth was looking to evolve castAR from a successful million dollar Kickstarter campaign into a mainstream business, she heard Rubin was doing a venture fund incubator program for startups, Playground Global. So she sent him an email, and eventually (following a successful tour of the Silicon Valley VC circuit) he replied, and invested.\u201cA few weeks into working with Andy and his team, he told us the key to creating a successful product is to leverage the talent of the developers out there,\u201d Ellsworth explained. \u201cIf there\u2019s something that\u2019s difficult for them to do, focus on making a tool to make it easier. That same lesson applies to making things easy for the end-user.\u201dEllsworth said Rubin will randomly drop by the office in Palo Alto and help the team stretch its thinking.\u201cHe\u2019ll spend a lot of time talking about where I want to go with the company two or three chess moves out,\u201d Ellsworth said.That blueprint is to launch a rock solid augmented reality experience this fall that anyone, including her father, can reach into and mold virtual clay or play a driving game with the grandkids plowing a tractor through virtual corn fields. By the third generation of the platform, Ellsworth wants to lift the experience off the table and allow them to watch movies in the kitchen on a virtual screen or cook with a virtual recipe book next to the smart stove or use the smart thermostat to see how energy consumption has been over the last month. Within 10 years, the goal is to start to replace today\u2019s smartphones and tablets and some general computing with augmented reality\u00a0and start to use AR for navigation.\u201cAndy helps you draw a line through all of these things we want to do and how to take the customer on this journey with you,\u201d Ellsworth said. \u201cWe talk about creating graphics on glasses and how we can train them up so by the time they\u2019re off the table and moving around they\u2019re already familiar with and comfortable with the technology.\u201dEllsworth also learned the lesson of moving the company forward, even if it means taking a loss to satisfy the past. After the successful Kickstarter campaign, castAR engineers were torn between building and shipping the older version of the platform, which connected to a home PC, and the newer (and final) retail project, which doesn\u2019t require a PC. Rubin and his team sat Ellsworth down and asked what she wanted to do. And she said she wanted castAR customers to wander around the world tetherless and enjoy these experiences.\u201cAndy told us to refund the Kickstarter backers\u2019 money and focus on the future,\u201d Ellsworth said. \u201cWe decided to give back their money and give them a free pair of the fully-integrated glasses when they\u2019re ready. Our CFO had a hard time with us giving away hundreds of thousands of dollars in free AR glasses, but the marketing guys said this was great for marketing the technology.\u201dWhile introducing brand new technology to consumers will be a challenge, it\u2019s just another hurdle for Ellsworth to navigate. And she has plenty of experience, and great mentors, to help her on this journey.John Gaudiosi is the Editorial Director at Shacknews.com.",

      "content": "After years of experimenting with 3D-printed footwear, Adidas on Friday announced that its first mass-produced 3D-printed shoe, the Futurecraft 4D, will go on sale this fall.The shoe's sole is shaped using digital light projection, a technology you might be familiar with if you shopped for a rear-projection TV 20 years ago. Despite rear-projection's demise, the technique is still alive in the\u00a03D printing\u00a0industry: it projects patterned light onto a liquid photopolymer resin, shaping and hardening it into layers.To make the Futurecraft 4D's sole, Adidas partnered with the Silicon Valley startup Carbon, which\u00a0says\u00a0that its digital light synthesis technique is more efficient than ordinary 3D printing, and thus better-suited to making large quantities of durable goods. According to\u00a0Texas Instruments, which originally developed the digital light processing concept in the 1980s, it's now used to quickly print everything from prototypes, jewelry casting, custom medical implants\u00a0and complex automotive and aerospace components.In Adidas's case, digital light synthesis results in a sole that works just as well as one made in an injection mold and has similar costs and production times. The company plans to sell 5,000 of the Futurecraft 4D this fall, and an additional 10,000 next year. Pricing hasn't been announced yet; Reuters\u00a0reports\u00a0that the shoes will sell at an \"unspecified premium price,\" but Adidas plans to lower the cost as the technology develops.Despite the benefits that 3D printing promises to bring to shoe design and manufacturing, it has been a gradual development process for Adidas and its competitors, at least compared to the consumer tech lifecycle. In 2013, New Balance became the first athletic brand to have a track athlete -- middle distance runner Jack Bolas -- compete in 3D-printed spike plates. But it wasn't until three years later that the company managed to\u00a0sell a 3D-printed shoe\u00a0to the public in the form of a limited-edition $400 sneaker.Adidas, meanwhile, unveiled the Futurecraft 4D's predecessor as a\u00a0concept shoe\u00a0in 2015. It used thermoplastic polyurethane instead of resin shaped by digital light projection.Tom is PCMag's San Francisco-based news reporter.\u00a0",

      "content": "Web and mobile apps are now a dime a dozen as more ventures join the rush to roll\u00a0out the next killer app. According to AppBrain, there are nearly\u00a02.8 million apps\u00a0on the Android market to date. Search for a particular interest or functionality and there is likely a dozen or so web and mobile apps that would pop up. The volume and pace of app creation lead to a sizable percentage of poorly developed apps that almost\u00a0a quarter of users\u00a0abandon them after first use.What is worse, these bad apps can leave users exposed. A\u00a0study\u00a0by Codified Security found that 40 percent of published apps leave vulnerable backdoors that can be exploited by attackers. These vulnerabilities can leave user data exposed or allow malicious actors to gain access to computers and servers used in testing and development.Related: How Do Google, Apple and Others Stack Up When It Comes to Protecting Your Privacy?The competitive nature of the industry demands ventures to ship software quickly.\u00a0However, shoddy coding and careless testing can leave the venture and its users exposed to cyberattack risks with potentially disastrous ends. The issue becomes even more pressing as new technology trends such as the wider adoption of financial technology and internet of things (IoT) devices is set to bring forth a new wave of apps and services.Security must be at the center of all tech startup activities.2016 had no shortage of high profile cyberattacks that involved large tech companies, internet infrastructure providers, banks\u00a0and government institutions. But, for every big name company, there were numerous other smaller organizations that also\u00a0suffered attacks. Among the top threats that persist today are ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS)\u00a0and data breaches.\u00a0Ransomware are consistently identified by security firms such as Kaspersky as\u00a0top threats\u00a0to organizations. Ransomware are malware that encrypt a computer or network\u2019s files. Attackers then demand ransom from victims in exchange for a chance of getting their files back.\u00a0DDoS attacks seek to deny access to a website or service by overwhelming its server with traffic. The biggest DDoS attack on record happened last year when DNS provider Dyn was hit. The outage also affected popular sites and apps that were under Dyn\u2019s network such as Netflix, Spotify and The New York Times.\u00a0Among these attacks, data breaches pose the real threat to end users. Stolen confidential information are commonly shopped around to criminal entities in the dark web. Data containing personal, financial\u00a0or proprietary information can return a profit when sold in the black market. Sites and apps that store customer information are prime targets for such attacks.Related: We Scored High on This Cybersecurity Quiz. How About You?Any form of downtime or disruption is costly for any business. Network security solution Incapsula estimates the cost of downtime caused by DDoS attacks to an ecommerce site to average\u00a0$40,000 per hour. Other attackers also perform DDoS attacks for ransom knowing that companies may be willing to pay in order to avoid the costs of downtime.An IBM and Ponemon Institute study says that each stolen record costs the company\u00a0$158 each\u00a0in damages. Getting hit by a data breach can heavily impact a company\u2019s valuation as well. The sale price of Yahoo! has dwindled since its disclosure of past massive data breaches. Verizon asked for a $3$350 million\u00a0discount\u00a0after the data breaches were publicized.As for ransomware, while attackers may only ask for\u00a0$722 on average, getting locked out critical files can be catastrophic for organizations that do not have backup systems in place. There is no assurance access will be restored even if the ransom gets paid.\u00a0Beyond the outright financial impact, businesses also risk loss of customer trust and reputation when hit by cyberattacks. For a startup, such fallout can sink the whole venture before it even gets off the ground.Related: The Worst Hacks of 2017 -- So FarBusinesses get exposed due to a variety of reasons. Non-tech startups are especially vulnerable. Often without dedicated personnel to oversee the proper use of IT resources, it is common for computers and networks to be left unsecure. Lack of training on fundamental IT security practices also leave staff vulnerable to social engineering attacks such as phishing which in turn pave the way for more serious attacks.Tech companies should know better. If they intend to market themselves as experts with superior products, they should be making security a critical part of their work. A good portion of tech startups effort is involved in product development so ensuring that their software is secure is vital.Mirai, the malware responsible for a number of massive DDoS attacks last year, exploits unsecure IoT devices and use them to carry out attacks. Many of these devices, which include IP cameras and network devices, were poorly designed and lacked security features that could have prevented Mirai infections. Leaving out security in the product design and making product development shortcuts can have serious consequences.The Codified Security also revealed that the app vulnerabilities are often due to careless coding. Developers may leave out information in their published code such as server credentials. As some apps use the same server instances when they go live, access to those servers can ultimately compromise all server data which, by that time, may already include customer information.Related: 4 Easy Ways to Protect Your Company From a CyberattackSo how can tech startups mitigate these risks?For developers, security should be a fundamental consideration in the software design. Code should be vigilantly reviewed in order to track vulnerabilities which can be exploited. It is critical to subject all software to intensive QA. Testing and should not be skipped in favor of accelerating shipping or launch dates.\u00a0Organizations should perform security audits to identify vulnerabilities in their operations. Educating staff regarding the best practices ensure that IT resources are used in a secure manner and that no company or customer data get compromised. Tech ventures should also be implementing security measures to cover other business activities especially those that involve customer data such as sales and marketing.Customer information should be held in the strictest confidence. Startups owe it to their customers to safeguard the privacy and security of those who entrusted the company with their business.Ralph Tkatchuk is a data security consultant and and an IT guy with 15 years of field experience working with clients of various sizes and verticals.

Inside the tube, pods filled with passengers and cargo will magnetically levitate and accelerate via electric propulsion to speeds approaching those of a commercial airliner. Such high speeds are attainable because of the tube's low atmospheric pressure, which contributes to reduced aerodynamic drag.The company plans to have a team of 500 engineers, fabricators, scientists\u00a0and other employees working on its technology by the end of the year. That's a big increase from last year, when the company had fewer than 100 engineers, many of them ex-NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory employees based at the company's headquarters in California.Last May, those engineers\u00a0demonstrated\u00a0their propulsion technology in front of hundreds of journalists. A small white sled accelerated to more than 100 miles an hour over a straight track of a few hundred meters, and the entire test lasted less than five seconds. One of the ex-JPL engineers, Cassandra Mercury, said at the time that the company was looking forward to testing the completed design.\"We're going to have it levitating, in a tube, with a pod, at vacuum,\" she told PCMag. \"That's why they're calling it the Kitty Hawk moment.\" With the tube now completed, those tests can begin, although the company did not offer a timeframe.In addition to overcoming technological hurdles, the company has also faced legal ones: co-founder and CTO Brogan BamBrogan, along with other former employees,\u00a0sued\u00a0the company last summer for wrongful termination, alleging, among other things, that they were forced out for speaking to investors about cultural issues within the futuristic firm.Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Wednesday that the technology will \"transform transportation as we know it.\" He is currently promoting the hyperloop as a feasible alternative to driving or flying between cities in the same region, such as Los Angeles to San Diego, Miami to Orlando and Seattle to Portland.Tom is PCMag's San Francisco-based news reporter.\u00a0",

According to Gallup, just\u00a013 percent of smartphone owners have a digital wallet app, while the majority of those who do have an app (76 percent), rarely use it.That may be disheartening for those of us involved in the industry, but there\u2019s always a silver lining.Business Insider\u00a0is forecasting that in the U.S. alone mobile payments volume will increase to $503 billion by 2020 and will be used by 56 percent\u00a0of the consumer population during that year. Meanwhile,\u00a0Sweden, Singapore, the Netherlands, France, Canada, Belgium\u00a0and the U.K. are already on their way to becoming cashless societies - with Australia, Brazil, India and much of Africa following suit.Related:\u00a0How Digital is India Towards a\u00a0Cashless\u00a0Future?While there are still barriers and limitations, such as security concerns and limited number of compatible vendors, digital wallets, and mobile payments are not only changing how we pay for goods and services, they also have the power to go beyond payments because of how they\u2019re constantly being evolved - which is going to be important for both businesses and customers.The idea of a digital wallet, which is basically just a digital version of a physical wallet, isn\u2019t new. In fact, David Chaum, an American cryptographer, created digital cash all the way back in 1983. That was\u00a0the beginning of cryptocurrencies.Once we entered the '90s, however, things began to accelerate rather quickly. Thanks to the internet and advances in technology, we had the ability to start ordering pizzas online (some claim that happened in 1994 when a customer ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza from Pizza Hut) and purchase movie tickets using a phone (Ericsson and\u00a0Telenor\u00a0Mobil accomplished this in 1999). We also saw the introduction of PayPal in 1998, which is considered the first digital wallet.By 2003, mobile devices started\u00a0picking up\u00a0momentum, which was followed by developments like the invention of bitcoin in 2008 and the introduction of Google Wallet (2011) and Apple Pay (2014).Related:\u00a0Looking for a New Payment Company?

Besides being a minor hassle, you no longer have to be concerned if you forgot your cash, credit card, or ID at home. All that information is stored\u00a0on\u00a0your smartphone. And, unlike your wallet, you probably never leave home without your phone.Additionally, using digital and mobile payments saves you time. Instead of inserting a card into an EMV terminal, you can just swipe and go. And, when shopping online, you no longer have to\u00a0race\u00a0against time to complete a purchase before your session expires, like when buying concert tickets. As long as you have a digital wallet, you can make instantaneous payments online.Digital wallets also come with customer perks like promotions, cash back rewards, and keeping track of your accounting easier. Most importantly, they\u2019re convenient. You can split a dinner tab with friends, pay bills, and avoid expensive transaction fees when you\u00a0travel.For businesses\u00a0you have access to funds almost immediately, you save money on transaction fees by removing third parties, and you don\u2019t have to invest in an expensive POS system. Additionally, digital and mobile payments provide access to real-time data, helps you maintain a competitive edge, and most importantly, improves the customer experience since you\u2019re providing fast and secure payment methods.Related:\u00a0Uber Reinvents Its Payment Model, Introduces\u00a0Digital WalletsDigital wallets and mobile payments are rapidly evolving\u00a0in order to enhance the experience for both customers and business owners.

      "content": "Computer-based artificial intelligence (AI) has been around since the 1940s, but the current innovation boom around everything from virtual personal assistants and visual search engines to real-time translation and driverless cars has led to new milestones in the field. And ever since IBM\u2019s Deep Blue beat Russian chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, machine versus human milestones inevitably bring up the question of whether or not AI can do things better than humans (it\u2019s the the inevitable fear around Ray Kurzweil\u2019s singularity).As image recognition experiments have shown, computers can easily and accurately identify hundreds of breeds of cats and dogs faster and more accurately than humans, but does that mean that machines are better than us at recognizing what\u2019s in a picture? As with most comparisons of this sort, at least for now, the answer is little bit yes and plenty of no.Less than a decade ago, image recognition was a relatively sleepy subset of computer vision and AI, found mostly in photo organization apps, search engines and assembly line inspection. It ran on a mix of keywords attached to pictures and engineer-programmed algorithms. As far as the average user was concerned, it worked as advertised: Searching for donuts under \u201cImages\u201d in Google delivered page after page of doughy pastry-filled pictures. \u00a0But getting those results was enabled only by laborious human intervention in the form of manually inputting said identifying keyword tags for each and every picture and feeding a definition of the properties of said donut into an algorithm. It wasn\u2019t something that could easily scale.More recently, however, advances using an AI training technology known as deep learning are making it possible for computers to find, analyze\u00a0and categorize images without the need for additional human programming. Loosely based on human brain processes, deep learning implements large artificial neural networks --\u00a0hierarchical layers of interconnected nodes -- that rearrange themselves as new information comes in, enabling computers to literally teach themselves. \u00a0As with human brains, artificial neural networks enable computers to get smarter the more data they process. And, when you\u2019re running these deep learning techniques on supercomputers such as Baidu\u2019s Minwa, which has 72 processors and 144 graphics processors (GPUs), you can input a phenomenal amount of data. Considering that more than three billion images are shared across the internet every day --\u00a0Google Photos alone saw uploads of 50 billion photos in its first four months of existence --\u00a0it\u2019s safe to say that the amount of data available for training these days is phenomenal. So, is all this computing power and data making machines better than humans at image recognition?There\u2019s no doubt that recent advances in computer vision have been impressive . . .\u00a0and rapid. As recently as 2011, humans beat computers by a wide margin when identifying images, in a test featuring approximately 50,000 images that needed to be categorized into one of 10 categories (\u201cdogs,\u201d \u201ctrucks\u201d and\u00a0others). Researchers at Stanford University developed software to take the test: It was correct about 80 percent of the time, whereas the human opponent, Stanford PhD candidate and researcher Andrej Karpathy, scored 94 percent.Then, in 2012, a team at the Google X research lab approached the task a different way, by feeding 10 million randomly selected thumbnail images from YouTube videos into an artificial neural network with more than 1 billion connections spread over 16,000 CPUs. After this three-day training period was over, the researchers gave the machine 20,000 randomly selected images with no identifying information. The computer looked for the most recurring images and accurately identified ones that contained faces 81.7 percent of the time, human body parts 76.7 percent of the time, and cats 74.8 percent of the time.At the 2014 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2014, Google came in first place with a convolutional neural network approach that resulted in just a 6.6 percent error rate, almost half the previous year\u2019s rate of 11.7 percent. The accomplishment was not simply correctly identifying images containing dogs, but correctly identifying around 200 different dog breeds in images, something that only the most computer-savvy canine experts might be able to accomplish in a speedy fashion. Once again, Karpathy, a dedicated human labeler who trained on 500 images and identified 1,500 images, beat the computer with a 5.1 percent error rate.This record lasted until February 2015, when Microsoft announced it had beat the human record with a 4.94 percent error rate. And then just a few months later, in December, Microsoft beat its own record with a 3.5 percent classification error rate at the most recent ImageNet challenge.Deep learning algorithms are helping computers beat humans in other visual formats. Last year, a team of researchers at Queen Mary University London developed a program called Sketch-a-Net, which identifies objects in sketches. The program correctly identified 74.9 percent of the sketches it analyzed, while the humans participating in the study only correctly identified objects in sketches 73.1 percent of the time. Not that impressive, but as in the previous example with dog breeds, the computer was able to correctly identify which type of bird was drawn in the sketch 42.5 percent of the time, an accuracy rate nearly twice that of the people in the study, with 24.8 percent.These numbers are impressive, but they don\u2019t tell the whole story. \u201cEven the smartest machines are still blind,\u201d said computer vision expert Fei-Fei Li at a 2015 TED Talk on image recognition. Yes, convolutional neural networks and deep learning have helped improve accuracy rates in computer vision \u2013 they\u2019ve even enabled machines to write surprisingly accurate captions to images -- but machines still stumble in plenty of situations, especially when more context, backstory, or proportional relationships are required. Computers struggle when, say, only part of an object is in the picture \u2013 a scenario known as occlusion \u2013 and may have trouble telling the difference between an elephant\u2019s head and trunk and a teapot. Similarly, they stumble when distinguishing between a statue of a man on a horse and a real man on a horse, or mistake a toothbrush being held by a baby for a baseball bat. And let\u2019s not forget, we\u2019re just talking about identification of basic everyday objects \u2013 cats, dogs, and so on -- in images.Computers still aren\u2019t able to identify some seemingly simple (to humans) pictures such as this picture of yellow and black stripes, which computers seem to think is a school bus. This technology is, unsurprisingly, still in its infant stage. After all, it took the human brain 540 million years to evolve into its highly capable current form.What computers are better at is sorting through vast amounts of data and processing it quickly, which comes in handy when, say, a radiologist needs to narrow down a list of x-rays with potential medical maladies or a marketer wants to find all the images relevant to his brand on social media. The things a computer is identifying may still be basic --\u00a0a cavity, a logo --\u00a0but it\u2019s identifying it from a much larger pool of pictures and it\u2019s doing it quickly without getting bored as a human might.Humans still get nuance better, and can probably tell you more a given picture\u00a0due to basic common sense. For everyday tasks, humans still have significantly better visual capabilities than computers.That said, the promise of image recognition and computer vision at large is massive, especially when seen as part of the larger AI pie. Computers may not have common sense, but they do have direct access to real-time big data, sensors, GPS, cameras\u00a0and the internet\u00a0to name just a few technologies. From robot disaster relief and large-object avoidance in cars to high-tech criminal investigations and augmented reality (AR) gaming\u00a0leaps and bounds beyond Pokemon GO, computer vision\u2019s future may well lie in things that humans simply can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) do. One thing we can be certain of is this: It won\u2019t take 540 million years to get there.Ophir Tanz\u00a0is an entrepreneur, technologist and the CEO and founder of GumGum, a digital-marketing platform for the visual web.

The four-time Bachelor, Bachelorette, and Bachelor in Paradise star has a new endeavor: a men's grooming startup called The Polished Gent.  \"I'm 36 years old, and I think I look young as f*ck. And we can all agree that I've polished up over the past few years. How did I do it? I have been using this amazing combination of products religiously,\" Viall said in an Instagram video announcing the line's launch.  Excited to finally announce my Men's Grooming line The Polished Gent! Coming May 8th. Follow us @thepolishedgents. Link in BIO for more info!  #getpolished #startup #comingsoon A post shared by Nick Viall (@nickviall) on May 4, 2017 at 4:09pm PDT The video is pretty self-aware -- it pokes fun at Viall's career alternatives post-Bachelor, aka selling tooth whitener and Fit Tea on Instagram. Since the 21st season of The Bachelor ended in March, Viall has competed on Dancing With the Stars and stayed engaged to the woman he proposed to in the finale, Vanessa Grimaldi.  Now Viall will enter the hallowed realm of subscription boxes. The Polished Gent sounds basically like Dollar Shave Club -- a curated selection of men's grooming products for thick, full hair and hydrated, smooth skin delivered to your home. From the startup's materials so far, the box sounds like a curated selection of different products, not Viall's own line.   The Polished Gent launches May 8, and you can request access now.  Maybe one day Viall's startup will sell for $1 billion? Sure beats selling software.   ",

The entrepreneur and Fresco Capital founder is launching a startup accelerator based in Rome -- and in part at the Vatican. The accelerator will focus on for-profit, mission-driven companies (aka companies that care about more than just turning a profit). The accelerator will accept applications from startups until June 5, which will probably have to be chosen through some sort of judging process.  Forte announced his plan in a Medium post Thursday night titled \"Why I'm Running an Accelerator at the Vatican.\" He was inspired to start the accelerator by, yep, Pope Francis.  \"I'm motivated to start a global conversation in the investment community on the value of for profit mission driven companies. As a global citizen with young children, I'm called to respond to His Holiness Pope Francis' challenge,\" Forte wrote.  Along with washing people's feet and giving homilies, Pope Francis has also supported mission-driven for-profits and challenged tech companies to do more for social good and to fight climate change, Forte noted.  The accelerator will operate in Rome from July 13 to Sept. 9 and is open to startups that have already gotten off the ground but haven't yet raised a Series A funding round. The program will provide a $100,000 for a 6-to-8 percent equity investment. The accelerator also includes a virtual component before and after the startups' time in Rome and ends with a Demo Day at the Vatican in December.  The program will choose startups working on ideas related to water, urban communities, \"human potential\" or easing suffering from migration, health and climate change, environmental conservation, and finance and industry as it relates to environmentalism and climate change.  Amen.   ",

It is only the fourth Indian startup to make it to the hallowed Harvard Business Publishing platform, after Flipkart (India's largest online retailer), Paytm (India's biggest mobile wallet) and GOQii (India's leading health and fitness startup). SEE ALSO: This health and fitness startup is now a Harvard case study The case titled 'Byju's - The Learning App' will outline the startup's unique usage of content, media and technology that has enabled it to create a compelling product for students.  Byju's now has over 400,000 annual paid subscribers, and over 8 million downloads so far. It also claims that the average time spent on the app is a handsome 40 minutes.   What makes Byju's -- a two-year-old company -- unique? In the words of its founder, Byju Raveedran, \"Learning through technology triggers changes in how students consume content. It offers them newer ways to explore concepts and initiate learning on their own.\" Perhaps that is what drew the attention of Mark Zuckerberg as well. Last September as the CZI led a $50 million investment in Byju's, the Facebook founder wrote, \"I'm optimistic about personalized learning and the difference it can make for students everywhere.\" \"That's why it's a major focus of our education efforts, and why we're looking forward to working with companies like BYJU's to get these tools into the hands of more students and teachers around the world,\" he added. Not only Zuckerberg, Byju's drew an undisclosed investment from World Bank's International Finance Corporation too. With these dollars, the startup plans to roll out new products and expand into the US and the UK.  Meanwhile, the Harvard case study, which has been authored by John Jong-Hyun Kim, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School, and Rachna Tahilyani, associate director, Harvard Business School India Research Center, is available for teaching purposes within and outside Harvard. \"It is very humbling to have our brand story as a Harvard Business School case study.

      "content": "India's Silicon Valley, Bangalore, was a startup darling just two years ago, but now its star appears to be dulling. Don't get us wrong, Bangalore has a lot going for it -- Amazon and Uber have offices there, it is home to over 2,000 active tech startups -- but according to a recent report ranking startup hubs, the city has fallen five spots to No. 20 out of 55.  Hot new Asian hubs, Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore, have surpassed it, according to Startup Genome's startup ecosystem report. SEE ALSO: Apple patent suggests an iPhone VR headset in your future So what's causing the decline and what can be done to stop Bangalore from losing its edge?   Image:  STARTUP GENOME Despite being a \"magnet\" for technology talent, Bangalore seems to have a quality problem. The report notes: \"Engineers haven't been hired very quickly, experience is average and visa success is low.\"  Also, there's a lot of churn among employees who move around to seek better opportunities. This could be because Bangalore is among the least-paying startup cities in the world for software engineers, who draw an average annual salary of $8600 -- 13 times less than that in the original Silicon Valley.  Better salaries could possibly arrest attrition and attract better quality talent.  Bangalore ranks a decent seventh globally when it comes to valuations, but has a \"very low exit sub-factor.\" That basically means that venture capitalists who invest in the city's startups have seen little or no success. Often times, companies have shut down within a year of their operations, drowning investor dollars with them.  Low exits, the report explains, could mean two things: Either the city has a bright future as these startups mature or there is trouble at the top of the market with acquisitions. \"Exits are tough in the Indian ecosystem only when they are incorrectly evaluated. A lot of times I have seen Indian companies making projections similar to their Silicon Valley peers without actually having the penchant to create global brands like the Silicon Valley companies do,\" says Kanwaljit Singh, founder and CEO of Gaussian Networks.  Getting real is the solution. Me-too startups have to be pruned. And the genuinely scale-able ideas with a potential for impacting millions of lives have to be backed.   Most startups in Bangalore are cash-strapped. Even Flipkart, the poster-child of India's startup economy, has yet to turn a profit after 10 years.  While funding seems fine, profitability has been the Achilles' heel for the city's startups. Even Delhi, India's capital, reportedly has more profitable startups. There is a widespread belief in India that marquee startups are justified in going through a long period of heavy losses because Google, Facebook and Amazon went through this.  While Bangalore is still India's Silicon Valley, cities like Chennai and Pune are catching up.  Chennai down south has already evolved as the SaaS hub of the country with companies like Zoho and Freshdesk, backed by rich investors.  And Pune in the west, which houses one of the three Microsoft data centers in India, is emerging as a strong competitor to Bangalore because of its vast IT pool, cheap real estate and favorable investment climate. Some reckon that it might soon outpace Bangalore completely. But if Pune and Chennai want to unseat Bangalore, the cities' startups must learn from its mistakes.   ",

      "content": "Thanks to a partnership with London-based fashion technology company Farfetch, you can soon get Gucci clothing and accessories whisked to your door within 90 minutes.  Farfetch announced the partnership Wednesday, as the company showcases what it's calling \"The Store of the Future\" -- software and devices that aim to help luxury brands gather more information on customers in stores and online. Customers will be able to shop for select items of Kering-owned Gucci goods via Farfetch's app and website, and have those orders fulfilled within 90 minutes from Gucci stores in London, New York, Dubai, Los Angeles, Madrid, Miami, Milan, Paris, Sao Paulo and Tokyo. The Gucci collaboration with Farfetch comes as competition heats up in online luxury. In a call with investors Tuesday, LVMH's chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said the world's largest luxury group would be the latest to ramp up multi-brand e-commerce, considering a new site for its luxury department store Le Bon Marche.  \"Retailers need a way to collect information about their customers while they are browsing in-store, just as they collect data from online searches,\" Jose Neves, Farfetch's founder and chief executive officer, said in a statement. Founded in 2008 as an e-commerce platform for luxury boutiques, Farfetch has increasingly positioned itself as a technology provider working directly with high-end brands. In March, it launched the e-commerce portal for high-end shoe designer Manolo Blahnik, pushing into a space where competitor Yoox Net-A-Porter Group SpA has been a leader, operating white-label websites for brands including Yves Saint Laurent and Armani.  Among the in-store technologies Farfetch is showcasing is a scanner that will enable customers to \"log-in\" with a smartphone when they enter a store, allowing a sales assistant to view the customer's profile, including what items they may have bought previously or saved to a wish list in the brand's online store.  A clothing rack has been designed to record what items the customer picks up, storing the item on an app on the customers' phone as well as for the retailer. The customer can later swipe left or swipe right to move items to a wish list. A smart mirror in stores will enable shoppers to move between browsing the online and in-store selections, Gavin Williams, a Farfetch director of product development, said in an interview.  The company is also showcasing a holographic display that will enable customers to create and order customized shoes -- experimenting with different leathers, skins and colors -- from luxury brand Nicholas Kirkwood. The technology, which Farfetch is calling Store of the Future, will be rolled out later this year at luxury boutique Browns in London, which Farfetch bought in 2015, and the flagship Thom Browne store in New York.  \nThis article originally published at Bloomberg\nhere\n ",

      "content": "We're hurtling towards a future where everything from cows to toasters will be internet-connected. But do we have the infrastructure to support this digital web? An Australian startup wants its nano satellites to help form the backbone of the internet of things. Founded in 2015, Adelaide-based Fleet announced a A$5 million ($3.8 million) Series A funding round Tuesday, to help build its satellite constellation. SEE ALSO: These American tech companies are heading south to list. But why? CEO and cofounder Flavia Tata Nardini said the team realised early on that the estimated 75 billion devices due to come online by 2025 couldn't do so without the right tools in place. \"Our idea was to try and enable this revolution, because it's really happening, it's going to change the industry, but it's not as simple as everyone says,\" she explained. In the past, nano satellites have been used for scientific missions, but more recently for commercial activities like Earth observation and mapping. Plant Labs, the California company founded by Australian Chris Boshuizen, is one player in this space. But Tata Nardini wants her constellation to help network smart devices and sensors across industries.  \"Fleet is playing in a space -- device connectivity -- which is quite unique. We want to be frontrunners,\" she said. Atlassian cofounder and Fleet investor Mike Cannon-Brookes said in a statement the company was solving an important problem: \"How do we bring all the devices and technology we've created together to work as one?\" \"Once live, Fleet will solve an innumerable amount of the world's problems as it enables the potential of technology to be turned on,\" he added. Of course, telecommunication companies such as Vodafone are also looking at 5G mobile networks, among other measures, to support the internet of things, but Tata Nardini thinks her tiny satellites could play a role.  \"Connecting people is actually quite different than infrastructure for things and devices,\" she said. \"It's less data, different timing -- things need an infrastructure themselves.\" There's also the matter of getting the devices into space, and the team is currently working on locating launch procurement in the U.S. \"Connecting people is actually quite different than infrastructure for things and devices.\" For now, Fleet plans to run pilot programs in different markets including agriculture, transport and oil and gas, before launching the first couple of satellites in 2018.  If all goes to plan, the entire 100-nano satellite constellation should come online over the next four years. Originally from Italy, Tata Nardini moved to Australia \"for a love story.\" She's worked with the European Space Agency, among others, but said Fleet's devices will be designed and built in Australia. After launch, they will serve a significant part of the globe. \"Most of South America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and in the future, we hope to cover part of the United States and Europe,\" she added. \"Europe is well connected, however when you go into oceans, imagine cargo or shipping containers moving from one continent to the other -- connectivity is just not there. There's a big opportunity.\" But while the private space industry is taking off globally with headline-grabbing companies like America's Space X and Blue Origin, Tata Nardini is adamant Australia need its own dedicated space agency to keep pace. She called for the government to step up. \"A space agency forces collaboration and innovation. I do think it's necessary,\" she said. \"The government has to keep up support and make radical changes in the coming years.\"  ",

      "content": "American technology companies are traveling to the other side of the world to raise a buck. The underwater drone company Aquabotix is one U.S. startup eyeing the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) as a venue to publicly list, rather than looking for venture capital at home.  If successful, it will join 12 U.S. tech listings to take place in Australia since 2013. There's fellow drone tech company Droneshield, which listed in 2016, as well as the troubled HR software startup, 1-Page in 2014. So why are they all heading south?  SEE ALSO: Meet the podcast proving that the future of sex tech is female For the most part, it's about size. Not only can such companies potentially raise capital in Australia at a better price, they may also find it easier to attract the attention of the press and analysts in a smaller pool. The phenomenon hit its peak in 2015, with seven U.S. tech listings. But Josh Collard, business development manager at the ASX, suggested the attraction is the ability to list at a relatively young age. While many companies see venture or private equity as the only options, the ASX thinks of itself as an alternative for companies at Series B or onwards. \"If you want to go public in the U.S. and you're less than A$1 billion ($757 million), you really are a very small fish in a big pond,\" he said. \"If you're too small for the public markets in the U.S. but are interested in going public, then we believe the ASX is a very interesting venue for you.\"  That's the case for Aquabotix, according to company chairman, Peter James. \"The amount of money we're looking to raise is only small -- A$5 to 7 million ($3.8 to $5.3 million) -- and in the U.S., you don't get any visibility or attention for that,\" he said. \"Certainly, the ASX is one of the few options.\"  It expects to list in May, and as James is also on the board of Droneshield, he has experience working with a U.S. company listing locally. There are benefits for the Australia exchange, too. It's about \"diversifying the menu,\" as Collard put it. \"We've got 2,200 listed companies on the exchange -- around 10 percent are foreign at the moment -- and there's real demand for more foreign listings.\" In fact, the ASX is actively wooing companies to list, not only in tech but healthcare and other fields through IPO roundtables held in places like Minneapolis. As a means for raising technology funds, the tactic is not without its skeptics.  Rick Baker, cofounder of the venture capital fund Blackbird Ventures, said he applauded all founders who managed to raise capital \"through whatever means.\" Still, he had some reservations.  \"Potential investors should look closely at why these companies are choosing to list on the ASX when there is such a deep and well formed venture capital market in the US,\" he said over email.  \"They should check that these are not just the companies which have failed to get funding over there.\" So, is the ASX being treated as a last resort? \"They should check that these are not just the companies which have failed to get funding over there.\" There's also been concern locally about the viability of reverse takeovers, otherwise known as backdoor tech listings, where a defunct ASX-listed resources company is used as a shell by a private company to gain entry to the market. This was a route taken by the aforementioned 1-Page, which is now reportedly fighting for its future. \"People in the tech scene in Silicon Valley think it is strange we are listing in Australia but when we explain all the advantages they think it's a genius idea,\" 1-Page cofounder and CEO Joanna Weidenmiller told the Financial Review in happier days. Most critics are concerned that companies listing this way are untested, presenting risks for the un-savvy investor. There are similar fears for foreign technology companies that list through the front door while still young, unproven and with little revenue. While Aquabotix made A$1.1 million ($832,282) of revenue in 2016, its classmate Droneshield listed with under A$124,000 ($93,821) of revenue in the first nine months of 2015. While he acknowledged concerns about backdoor listings, James argued Aquabotix is going \"straight through the front door.\" While he's familiar with the venture route, he suggested the company had always been bootstrapped and a listing is the next logical step. Unlike some others, it's also profitable. \"I think it's a fair comment that there's a lot of [venture capital] activity in the U.S. -- that's 100 percent true -- but we can be an alternative,\" Collard added.  \"Like every opportunity, it needs to go through its normal checks and balances.\"  ",

      "content": "Finding a place to rent can be hellish, but does transferring that process online make it better? One startup argues yes, but tenancy advocates are doubtful. Alex Lubinsky, the CEO of the Californian company Rentberry, is aggressively confident about the usefulness of his product. He even characterised the heavy criticism levelled at it in the U.S. as \"good publicity.\" His site allows prospective tenants to make offers against others to secure properties. While Lubinsky would prefer those offers be called \"custom submission,\" it's not hard to see why it's been called an \"eBay-style\" platform on which tenants will rush to outbid each other, potentially pushing prices to new heights.  If the landlord accepts, the tenant then pays Rentberry A$25, although the company has floated changing that to a percentage model. SEE ALSO: A floating techno-libertarian city might be coming to the Pacific The startup launched in 10 cities across the U.S. in 2016, and is now rolling out to at least 1,000. First reported by Domain, Rentberry has announced its intention to launch in Australia. With no set launch date, Lubinsky said he also has his sights set on Canada and the UK. There's plenty to fix about renting, no doubt. Attending a house inspection, filling out a form and rushing to the real estate agent's office all in one day is de rigueur. Some automation wouldn't hurt. And it's not uncommon in Sydney for potential renters to offer the landlord a little more rent each month to secure a lease. Ned Cutcher, senior policy officer at the Tenants Union of New South Wales, acknowledged such a situation is happening \"on the sly.\" Still, he doubts Rentberry is the solution. \"This idea sells itself on making that transparent, but I don't think that's the right response,\" he said. \"The secret business of pushing up rents doesn't not push up rents by taking the secret out.\" Lubinsky claimed the site in fact had the opposite effect over nine months in its 10 launch cities, saving tenants 5.1 percent on rent.  However, Toby Bozzuto, CEO of the real estate development company Bozzuto Group, told the Wall Street Journal those numbers might be helped along by an oversupply of apartments across the U.S. In Australia, the situation may be different. Sydney, for example, is reportedly dealing with oversupply in some suburbs and undersupply in others. \"I'm not convinced of how encouraging people to bid up a price brings that price down.\" Tenants saved money because landlords want the most qualified, trustworthy people as their renter, Lubinsky argued. \"When somebody submits an application, landlords, they are not eager to take the highest bidder. Everyone knows this, but people disregard this and say, 'oh, it's all about money' -- well, it's not,\" he said.  Cutcher, however, was was unconvinced. \"Scarcity is a key factor. If you've got more people who are looking for properties than there are available, the only real impact this can have is pushing rents up,\" he said. \"I'm not convinced of how encouraging people to bid up a price brings that price down.\" Rentberry also forces transparency on the renter that's not quite expected of the landlord. There are fears, raised by Grist, that user profile pictures could prompt landlords to racially discriminate against prospective tenants. Lubinsky, for his part, dismissed that, suggesting users could use cartoon avatars if they wished. In the U.S., the company also supplies the applicant's credit score and background check results to the landlord, but he could not disclose which companies it would be working with in Australia to provide those details. The tenants, of course, don't see quite as much information about their landlord. What if they're notorious for letting properties fall into disrepair, for example? Lubinsky suggested the ability for tenants to review and rate landlords after they leave will take care of that. Either way, as many have noted, it's clear landlords have the power. If they chose to use Rentberry, tenants may be forced to follow them there.  ",

      "content": "There's a little bit of a rebel within us all. Brad and Gazz -- two Welsh lads with a passion for all things beer -- decided to take their love for beer a step further back in 2008 and the result is Tiny Rebel Brewery, an award-winning brewing company whose beers can be found in fridges worldwide. Tiny Rebel's humble beginnings can be found in a Welsh garage, where Brad and Gazz spent their weekends on their hobby brewing beer. As self-confessed \"beer geeks\" the pair got pretty good at the brewing lark and began to take it a little more seriously -- in 2010 thanks to a few thousand pounds of investment, some more robust brewing equipment and a shed-load of ingredients Tiny Rebel was born and they set about creating their first Tiny Rebel beers. Speaking to Mashable, co-founder Bradley Cummings shared more on Tiny Rebel's beginnings. \"We wanted Tiny Rebel to represent us and things that we were interested in growing up - urban culture, 90's music, being a bit rebellious and not taking ourselves too seriously.\" This ethos has carried through from the early days to now -- the company may now be a global success but it's still unapologetically built on a sense of fun. Like with most startup ventures, the team faced their fair share of barriers to success in the early days -- especially given the economic climate within which they were trying to launch. \"Pubs were closing around the time we were setting up, which meant investment was a challenge.\" Bradley recalls. \"We were also creating a new market for Wales that didn't really exist\", something which is a risk in itself. The team soldiered on though and made it to the development stage. The Tiny Rebel team must've been thankful for their \"beer geek\" roots -- especially given the gruelling development process that went into the creation of their first staple brews. The development stage of the company saw Brad and Gazz create north of 150 different brews, finally settling on two of their core offerings in February 2012 -- FUBAR and Urban IPA went on to become award-winning beers, and are still two of the company's most prized brews. Just a year after the company's official launch the team went global in 2013, exporting beers to Denmark and Australia. While things took off overseas though, the boys made sure they stayed grounded and remembered their roots. \"There's some great beer coming out of Britain at the moment and it's awesome being a part of it\" Bradley told Mashable, and their achievements at home are a testament to this. In the same year the team began exporting abroad, they also cleaned up at the Great Welsh Beer Festival, taking home gold, silver and bronze awards for their Dirty Stop Out, FUBAR and Urban IPA brews respectively. Later down the line their Cwtch beer took the Champion Beer of Britain accolade in 2015, and in 2016 the company won brewery business of the year from The Society for Independent Brewers.  Image:  tiny rebel The Tiny Rebel team was busy in 2013. Not content with just brewing and exporting their wares, racking up awards and watching their sales figures fly up, the company also opened the very first, fully devoted craft beer bar in Cardiff. Physical premises have expanded since then too: \"November 2015 saw us open our second Tiny Rebel bar in the heart of our home town of Newport\" Bradley told Mashable, \"And we kept on setting ourselves ambitious goals.\" So what's next for the Welsh brewers? \"We've just invested PS2.6m in a new brewery giving us the facilities to become fully self sufficient in brewing and packaging, which was always a goal of ours when we were brewing in the garage just over 5 years ago\" Bradley divulged. The team plans on opening the doors of its brewery to the public, too, sharing their story and the entire brewing process with their customers.  ",

SEE ALSO: China's big, beautiful, green 'vertical forests' will suck up toxic smog One of the biggest contributors to toxic emissions are vehicles. So an Indian startup is approaching the problem from the rear end. Literally. It blocks diesel emissions at the point of contact with the atmosphere, recycles the leftover carbon and uses it to make art.  Anirudh Sharma pictured with his Kaalink device. Image:  Matt Crossick/PA Wire Graviky Labs has developed a device called Kaalink which attaches to diesel exhaust pipes and can capture up to 95 percent of carbon soot, stopping it from entering the atmosphere.  The soot is then recycled into ink and transformed into marker pens, called Air-Ink.  This is what ink made from car exhaust pipes looks like. Image:  John sanders According to Graviky Labs co-founder Anirudh Sharma, the simple plugin tech could provide up to 30 trillion litres of cleaner air for Londoners annually. And a whole load of pens - one pen is filled with ink extracted from approximately 50 minutes of diesel car pollution. It's not the first time they have used the ink to paint a powerful picture about the issue in polluted cities. Previously, they teamed up with street artists in Hong Kong to paint the street with its condensed polluted air.   Mr Doodle (left) and Anirudh Sharma join forces for some air pollution art in London. Image:  John sanders Now they're in London hosting the world's first Clean Art Gallery in Brixton. The pop-up exhibition features five artists from the UK's most polluted cities. Coincidently, Brixton has already surpassed its 2017 air pollution limit. And it's not even halfway through the year.   Artist Kristopher Ho turns London's air pollution into a wild animal. Image:  John Sanders The pop-up exhibition coincides with what is described as a 'unique' clean air initiative unveiled by London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Khan, working alongside Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, wants to introduce restrictions on vehicle emissions and upgrades on public transport, urging a swift shift to tackle a pressing problem. Clearing the air we breathe, they say, is an urgent priority that requires transforming how cities flow.  Pleased to announce my latest initiative to clean up London's air. Our online cleaner vehicle checker is a world first of it's kind. pic.twitter.com/WBpUrEmVns -- Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) March 29, 2017 For Sharma, too, that is the main priority. Creating art using his soot-capturing technology is just one side of the coin. He is now looking to collaborate with other disciplines, and with people like London's Mayor, to scale up the technology and make a larger-scale impact. One of most important developments for Air-Ink is improving its quality so that it's suitable for printing. For the moment, though, turning air pollution into safe and rather decent art supplies is no small feat.  Inside the Tiger Beer 'Clean Air Gallery' in Brixton Image:  Matt Crossick/PA Wire  ",

      "content": "Small businesses, as the saying goes, need all of the help they can get these days. Clate Mask, CEO and cofounder at Infusionsoft, is one who helps small businesses and lends a hand. Mask is a visionary leader who took Infusionsoft from a struggling startup to an eight-time Inc. 500/5000 winner. Clate has helped this company land four rounds of venture capital, including a $55 million Series D led by Bain Capital Ventures with contributions from prior investors that included Signal Peak Ventures and Goldman Sachs. Clate Mask has been named an Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year finalist, a Top 100 Small Business Influencer by Small Business Trends, one of the 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs of 2013 by Goldman Sachs, and Business Leader of the Year by the Arizona Technology Council. Mask also co-authored the New York Times bestseller, \"Conquer the Chaos: How to Grow a Successful Small Business Without Going Crazy.\" But what Mask does exceedingly well is help other entrepreneurs understand how to determine and accept the right funding for their businesses as well as how to assess what type of funding may not be right for them. I was able to catch up with Mask and learn more about his continued success and how his transition to Infusionsoft has progressed: Why did you start Infusionsoft?  Scott Martineau, the Co-Founder, and I started Infusionsoft to create a team of innovators, industry experts, tech geeks and small business zealots that were focused on our mission to help other small businesses succeed. As entrepreneurs ourselves, we understood the struggle of turning an idea into a viable business and getting the funding needed to do so.  What had to change about the product in order to get investors interested? We knew we had a powerful piece of software that did a lot for automating sales and marketing. However, we quickly realized that we needed to streamline the implementation experience so customers could tap into that great power much more easily and shorten the time it took to start enjoying the benefits of the software. Once we really got the automation process in place, it changed interest and we knew we had something special. What can an entrepreneur do to ensure they have something investors may want to fund? Have a big problem to solve that involves a large segment of the market. Be prepared to go the distance with passion and tenacity to get through the barriers, especially one of the big barriers - rejection. Creating a big vision keeps you focused on what you are trying to accomplish. What types of problems did you experience when trying to accomplish what you were creating with Infusionsoft? The first three years essentially involved not being sure we were going to make it as a business or be able to get enough funds to even begin to have an income. We then ended up with considerable funding, raising approximately $19 million, but we still had some problems in terms of adjusting our business model. This led to our churn going sky high and that caused our business model to get screwed up. An unstable business model nearly cost us the company because we were close to using up all those funds in the process. Did this funding nearly kill the business or was it a particular situation? It's really a combination of things that can make you succeed, but it's critical to get the right investor and right funding in the first place. Having the right funding and investor can prevent making the mistakes we did - that nearly killed our company. When we received the $19 million, it just seemed like those funds would last forever and we would be able to do whatever we wanted to with it. However, if we were to do it all again, I would say that it would help to have investors that participated more in the strategy and build-out so we could learn from their experience and be guided a bit more through the decision-making process on how the funds should be spent. We needed someone with experience with funds who would be willing to help us with the knowledge of what were essentials for purchase in a business and which items can wait. Having investors who doubled as mentors and who filled in the skills gaps really helped us to ensure we didn't waste funding. You've received even bigger amounts than $19 million so how did you stay grounded and use those funds wisely?  It's important never to focus on the size of the funding. Instead, only look at what you want to accomplish and then thoughtfully determine how you can get those processes done, talent hired, or company expanded on as lean a budget as possible. Stay scrappy and tell yourself you have to survive on scraps rather than assuming you are utterly successful and can spend like there's no tomorrow just because the funding is there. Do you have other suggestions about what else is important for an entrepreneur to know about raising money? You aren't raising the money in the first place to completely change your strategy. You are looking for funding to fuel the strategy you already crafted and help accelerate the transition from idea into full-blown business. Stay focused on what you need the money for as your marker for going out and finding investors who share that same vision of what your company is intended to become.  Maintain that reality check for yourself as founders and for the talent that comes on board and hears how much money has been raised. Communicate how the funding will be spent on enacting your existing strategy and how those who join you can help achieve the company goals. Do you have any advice on how to spot a bad investor for your company? We learned that having common interests doesn't mean the investor is necessarily right for you. Sure, they are in your industry as well as understand and believe in what you are developing. Maybe they even have great connections to help you. However, if they don't share your common vision, it's never going to be successful. This vision is about where the company is headed, how it will get there, how big your company will become, how the business plan for the company will evolve, and what will happen to plans in the future. If there are conflicting opinions on this vision, this could be the death knell, or the last tolling of the bell for the company. Make sure you know what each investor's vision is for the company before taking their money. What else can an entrepreneur look for to determine if it's a good or bad investor for their company? Do your research and study the investors that are out there and especially any investors which have shown interest in providing you with funds. You can find out what these investors or companies have invested in before and why and how they have helped other ventures, as well as how the investment operations ended up. Also consider how experienced a company is at investing in general in your industry, and in your particular solution. The company which wants to become a part of your business experience and reputation will also tell you what you can expect from the relationship. How has this investor handled previous challenges? You can even check in with other startups where your investor has supplied funds to learn more about how the experiences were for that founder. This due diligence can then provide the answer as to whether this investor is right or wrong for your company. Entrepreneurs are taking a risk just like the investors they are pitching to because the entrepreneur is inviting someone else into their company to share in its development in exchange for a significant chunk of money that they will have to return at some point. Mask noted that, the more time you can spend doing your investor homework, the better chance you will have for finding the perfect match that takes your startup to the next level.

Softbank is reportedly \"orchestrating\" a merger between Flipkart, India's biggest online retailer, and rival Snapdeal, and could possibly have a deal by the end of next  month.  SEE ALSO: India's biggest online retailer is acquiring eBay's India business, report says Interestingly, Softbank is the largest investor in Snapdeal with a 30 percent share.  Snapdeal though is struggling to survive in the face of stiff domestic competition, especially after the aggressive expansion of Amazon which is now the second-biggest online retailer in the country.  It has been in talks with various domestic rivals for a possible merger. Snapdeal even considered merging with Alibaba-backed Paytm, according to reports. The Chinese internet giant is an existing investor in Snapdeal too.  Not only Snapdeal, but even Flipkart is feeling the Amazon heat.  Most recently, it was reportedly in talks to acquire eBay's India business as part of a $2 billion fund raising that saw investments from Tencent and Microsoft. The online retailer has been devalued by Morgan Stanley twice in quick succession and is now valued at a mere $5.37 billion from $15.2 billion in 2015.  Softbank, meanwhile, is looking to invest about $1.5 billion for a 15 percent share in the Flipkart-Snapdeal combine, the Times of India report added. If and when the new entity comes about, it would be Amazon's primary competitor in India.  Last year, Amazon's gains had come at the expense of Flipkart and Snapdeal's market share in the $15 billion online retail industry. Currently, the Jeff Bezos-owned internet giant is doing a business of about $4 billion and is the No. 2 in India after Flipkart. India is a particularly important market for Amazon, especially after its failure in China. \"Success in India means that Amazon's retail model can work outside of 'traditional' markets in North America and Europe, and helps provide better visibility in how Amazon can continue to grow for many years in the future,\" a San Francisco-based analyst was quoted as saying.

Data Does Good, a company founded by two students at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, lets you donate your Amazon.com shopping history and turn it into hard cash for good causes -- at no extra cost. SEE ALSO: This Chrome extension helps you find ethical shopping alternatives -- and saves you money The website takes your anonymous and encrypted shopping history and sells it to brands and retailers looking for trends and valuable marketing information about its consumers, like gender and age. As a public benefit corporation (essentially a hybrid between a for-profit company and a nonprofit), Data Does Good earns money to make the business sustainable, but it donates the majority of its proceeds to any charity of your choice. The tool aims to use technology and data to change the way people donate, and also increase financial support for worthy causes.  Data Does Good cofounder and CEO Scott Steinberg used to work in market research, where he learned people's information had untapped potential. He believed people could do good with their data, but they just didn't have the option. \"This is something everyone has and everyone can use.\" Inspired by modern technology's effects on fundraising, like the 2014 viral Ice Bucket Challenge, he and his cofounder, Eric Peter, decided to create Data Does Good to combine data and impact, helping consumers and nonprofits alike. \"This resource -- your data -- is something that everyone has, whether you're a low-income person living in an urban city center or a mother of three of a rural area,\" Steinberg said. \"This is something everyone has and everyone can use. We're really excited about this as not just a new way to raise money for valuable causes, but as a way to allow everyone, across the demographic spectrum, to participate in fundraising.\"  Image:  Data Does Good Here's how it works: You go to the Data Does Good site, select a nonprofit you want to support, and then share your Amazon shopping history in one of two ways. You can either download an Excel spreadsheet of the list of purchases you've made in the past and upload it to the site, or you can link your account and Data Does Good automates the process for you. You also need to provide some information, like your age and income. That kind of info is gold to brands and retailers, helping them understand how consumers shop online. By including it yourself, Steinberg said, it allows Data Does Good to completely anonymize your shopping history and strip it of any personally identifiable information before it sends it to brands. \"It's really just something you do one time. You may take two or three minutes to do this today, but it will raise money for years to come, without you having to do anything,\" Steinberg said. Alarmed by the situation in #Syria? Donate your shopping history below to provide future aid through @SyriaRandD https://t.co/B3y9ZIGNz8 pic.twitter.com/yCvyZzOE3p -- Data Does Good (@DataDoesGood) December 21, 2016 With the proceeds it gets from its market research tool, Data Does Good then donates $15 a year per user to a nonprofit of their choice. That may not sound like a lot, but Steinberg said when a large number of people participate, the impact magnifies. \"One way to think about it is, 'Oh, it's only $15.' But another way to think about it is, 'I do this thing that only takes me two minutes ... and it raises $15 per year.' If thousands or millions of people do this, that's when it starts to have a substantive impact,\" he said. \"If thousands or millions of people do this, that's when it starts to have a substantive impact.\" While users can donate to any charity, Data Does Good also partners with about 50 nonprofits. Those organizations can create custom donation pages, and when they send the tool to their supporters, those individual contributions can be even more beneficial. But $15 per year for each user is just a starting point. The company is starting with Amazon to perfect the tool, gather feedback and make sure it's done right -- before attempting to expand to other other types of data. \"Everything you do on the internet, you're generating data about yourself -- when you go to Google, when you watch something on Netflix,\" Steinberg said. \"The goal is really to use Amazon as a proof point, and then expand beyond that in ways that people feel comfortable with, but help them get value from all their different data points.\" Today it might be $15 per year, he said, but in three years, it might be $150 or even $200 per year.  Image:  Data Does Good Data Does Good officially launched in November 2016, when it started collecting donations, after the team worked on it for about a year. They wanted to make sure they understood needs from consumers, nonprofits and businesses to make sure it was something desired. The feedback they've received so far has confirmed that. Consumers have said it's extremely easy to use, while nonprofits have found it to be even more efficient that traditional fundraising, both in terms of reaching new supporters and reinvigorating older relationships. \"That's not to say we're replacing traditional fundraising at all,\" Steinberg said. \"But I think it's a good complement to that.\" We're trying to change people's behavior, and that takes some time Data Does Good hopes to be a standardized fundraising tool for nonprofits of all sizes -- but especially for smaller nonprofits, which may not have a lot of time or resources for big fundraising efforts. Short-term, Data Does Good wants to expand its number of partnerships with nonprofits and reach as many consumers as possible. \"Our goal over the next nine to 18 months or so would be to just really nail Amazon shopping history and create a couple of million dollars of new funding for nonprofits,\" Steinberg said. Ultimately, he wants Data Does Good to be a \"trusted intermediary and partner,\" so consumers can get value out of the data they might not realize they possess, and share what they're comfortable with for a higher purpose. \"We're trying to change people's behavior, and that takes some time,\" Steinberg said. \"It's doable, but it needs to be done in the right way, and be a good experience for everyone involved.\"   ",

On a journey that may seem alien to most, Edinburgh startup FanDuel began their venture in North America, and only recently brought their platform to their UK home. The company got its start back at 2009's South by SouthWest interactive festival in Texas, where its five co-founders came up with the idea of daily fantasy football during a backyard brainstorm. Making a departure from season-long online gaming tournaments, the team hit on the idea of creating shorter gameplay, with more opportunity for players to opt in on a daily basis. Its website pegs FanDuel as \"a new way to play fantasy -- fan vs. fan in a test of sports knowledge and fantasy knowhow -- where winners can taste victory on any given day. Not just once a year.\" Fantasy sports brings a whole new dimension to the lives of sports fans -- whenever a fantasy team player is on the pitch IRL, there's an element of extra excitement and personal involvement for users. The company claims to have increased sports content consumption by 40% simply by making sports \"more exciting\" -- 60% of FanDuel users watch more live games as a result of being a FanDuel member. From its inception until now, the company has won a variety of awards for excellence in mobile innovation, including 2016's The Webby Award: Judges Selection award for best sports app on a handheld device. Its accolades are underpinned by its impressive stats - valued at over a billion dollars after several funding rounds, FanDuel has over six million registered users and counting. FanDuel users in the US and Canada can play in the National Football League (NFL), the National Basketball Association (NBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Hockey League (NHL) and England's Premier League. When the company expanded into the European market with its UK launch the team focused primarily on the English Premier League -- the Prem is a pretty big deal in the UK and it's not so often you'll meet a big baseball fan in the UK. What's in the future for FanDuel? It's heavily focused on expanding its user base -- the company invests heavily in advertising across its territories in order to retain its place as a market leader in the fantasy sports sector. We could see a global expansion of the platform in the future, but for now the team seems set on growing their presence back home in the UK.   ",

The deal is said to be structured as part of Flipkart's ongoing $2 billion fundraising. The Bangalore-based company is seen to be strengthening its arsenal to wage a war with Amazon that might soon define India's $15 billion e-commerce sector. SEE ALSO: Flipkart acquires Jabong for $70 million to create India's biggest online fashion retailer EBay, which debuted in India in 2004, three years before Flipkart and almost a decade before Amazon, could never quite crack the market.  Currently, it ranks sixth in the pecking order of e-commerce firms after Flipkart, Amazon, Shopclues, Paytm and Snapdeal. Incidentally, eBay is a minority investor in Snapdeal and has made failed attempts in the past to acquire the Gurgaon-based firm.  In November 2016, eBay fired its entire product and tech team in India, except 15 officials, who were reportedly being moved to the U.S.  Mashable reached out to Flipkart and eBay for comment.  \"EBay does not comment on market speculations,\" an eBay India spokesperson said.  Flipkart in March closed in on a $1 billion funding at a valuation of $10 billion, with backers that included Microsoft, Chinese giant Tencent and eBay itself. The poster child of India's startup ecosystem has been in advanced talks with multiple investors for fresh capital after talks with American retail giant Walmart for a $1 billion infusion fell through last year.  The company has had 13 rounds of fund infusion since early 2009. Late last year Morgan Stanley had slashed its valuation by over $5 billion as losses mounted and management reshuffles continued to haunt the company. Amazon, meanwhile, continues to take giant strides in the market, growing its shipments by over 150 percent, and narrowing the market-share gap with Flipkart. India's startup commentators don't seem too positive about the Flipkart-eBay merger.  One of them writes: \"Culturally, the two companies are totally different. eBay is a pure play marketplace, while Flipkart is a forced marketplace due to funding structure... It's just different DNA.\"  ",

Or, perhaps more realistically, in the next 20 years -- depending on battery technology advancements. Wright Electric, an aircraft manufacturer startup based out of Massachusetts, debuted its idea for a no gas 150-seat plane at Tuesday's Y Combinator Demo Day in Silicon Valley as part of the incubator's bi-annual showcase of new startups.

Woo hoo!\"  The company went on to spell out what needs to happen to make the idea a reality. The plane's shape and design won't be anything new since, according to Wright Electric, those components have already been mostly perfected.  It's the battery technology that will power the plane that needs to come together in the next decade. It's the battery technology that will power the plane that needs to come together in the next decade.  The company talked about a potential hybrid electric motor if battery advances don't continue on pace like they have for the past century. Some experts are skeptical about the company's plans. Graham Warwick, an aviation expert from Aviation Weekly told the BBC, \"The battery technology is not there yet.\" \"It's projected to come but it needs a significant improvement,\" he added. \"Nobody thinks that is going to happen anytime soon. And there's all the [safety] certification - those rules are yet to be created, and that takes time.\" However, the company remains optimistic, and has been working with Chip Yates, who clocked the longest electric flight recorded at about 1,000 miles.

      "content": "Plastic is a problem. It's a problem that Scottish startup MacRebur is taking on one mile at a time. MacRebur is aiming to challenge three major world issues: Repurposing millions of tonnes of waste plastic, saving millions in the cost of road repairs and strengthening our existing roads. The idea for the startup was born when CEO and co-founder Toby McCartney - who happens to live on a road plagued by potholes himself (delete 'himself') - visited India and witnessed people melting down plastic they found on local landfill sites to repair potholes. While the method he witnessed on that trip wasn't particularly environmentally practical, McCartney left with the idea of using waste plastic to replace and reinforce the roads here in the UK and beyond. Both potholes and waste plastic are potentially hazardous - uneven road surfaces increase the likelihood of road accidents, whereas plastic lying dormant in landfill sites is harmful to our environment. Repurposing that waste plastic to work towards improving the safety of our roads whilst creating stronger, more resilient roads that will stand the test of time is at the heart of MacRebur, and their startup is hitting the road hard. While McCartney's trip to India saw him witness waste plastic being crammed into potholes, doused in petrol and set alight, MacRebur's approach to using plastic in new and existing road composition has a little more strategy and environmentally conscious thought behind it. Rather than simply filling holes with the plastic that may wear away faster than traditional road materials, MacRebur is pelletising a mix of waste plastics and adding them to existing road materials, strengthening the material used to fill potholes and create new roads. Traditional road materials such as asphalt and bitumen are costly - road repairs are funded from the tax-payers' purse, making innovation in this space in the greater interest of everyone and their neighbour. By adding the waste plastic pellets to the road the cost of producing the material is reduced, waste plastic is recycled effectively and the roads themselves will last longer - a win-win situation for all. The company has conducted extensive testing into just how well these roads will perform, and has created road surfaces for lorry parks, airport runways and council roads. The company hopes that their expertise will help to change the way we build roads and recycle waste plastic in the UK, Europe and eventually worldwide, and as the 2016 winner of the Virgin Media Business Voom competition the company has gained national support for their venture. Its success in this competition has helped the team build their business from an idea to a tried and tested offering, and with its funding mission in full swing, the team seem to be on the right road to changing the way we travel for the better.

      "content": "Australia is a one ride share company town. Want to take a trip in someone else's depreciating asset? Uber's almost your only option (sorry, GoCatch). Americans, of course, have an alternative: Lyft. So when director of strategic partnerships, Insiya Lokhandwala, appeared on the schedule of Brisbane's Myriad startup festival in late March, you had to wonder: Was Australia's moment finally here?  SEE ALSO: Uber wants to wean drivers off Google Maps and onto their new system Lyft's communication director was noncommittal. \"Nothing to share at this time,\" Sheila Bryson said in an email. \"FWIW our execs speak all over.\" On the phone Tuesday, Lokhandwala maintained the party line: The company is ruthlessly focused on America, despite rumours to the contrary. \"There is still a lot of work we have to do in the U.S,\" she said. \"Our investors are happy for us to continue to focus here.\"  And fair enough, it does have a lot of work to do: Lokhandwala said Lyft completed more than 162 million rides in the U.S. in 2016, but according to Quartz, Uber booked 78 million in December alone. Lyft is shaping up to be extra aggressive in 2017, quickly meeting its goal of expanding to at least 100 new cities by March. Still, Lyft's America-focused rhetoric obscures a few key deals. Although Lokhandwala couldn't comment on the fine details, Lyft did enjoy international partnerships with some of the largest local ride hailing companies in Australia's region.  In China, it was linked up with famed Uber slayer Didi Chuxing, which also made a small, undisclosed investment in Lyft in 2015. In India, it partnered with Ola, and in southeast Asia, with Grab. This arrangement integrated the apps, allowing users to find rides whenever they travel in those markets.  Once deemed the \"anti-Uber alliance,\" it's all been a bit quiet of late, and Didi and Grab confirmed to Mashable Wednesday the roaming arrangement had been suspended. So any new international partnerships planned? No comment. You can chalk up the international strategy so far to Lyft's \"attitude of partnerships,\" Lokhandwala was able to say. \"That's kind of how we think about scale, to partner with the best partners in the industry in their own field. \"That was really the incentive for our partnership with Didi and Grab ... to give the users the choice of when they go to those markets, to direct them to those services that are the local best.\" Lyft as well as Ola have been approached for comment about the end of the deals. \"Our investors are happy for us to continue to focus here and keep growing our market share.\"  Lokhandwala does hope to share a vision during her visit to Australia, although for the moment it seems unlikely Lyft will be the one to deliver it in Sydney or Melbourne: A future where transport becomes a service.  When cars become fully-autonomous, Lokhandwala thinks people will access them through a fleet of networked cars, like Lyft. \"You're used to opening your app and ordering a Lyft car ... so that's how we think cars will be accessed by users,\" she said. Lyft has partnered with General Motors since early 2016 to develop autonomous driving technology.  \"That's where we think the true disruption of this comes in,\" she said. \"In the world of autonomous, that's the true disruption. There's no need for cars to be sitting idle. That means less cars, less congestion. It's better for the environment and far more affordable.\" But given this is a view of the future shared by everyone from Uber to Steve Wozniak, why will Lyft be the one to win? In Lokhandwala's view, its brand will be the trump card. \"Because it has been such a mission driven company, the brand has evolved very organically into this fun, friendly, reliable brand that people trust,\" she said. \"That's not something you can buy in the market, it's just something organic to Lyft.\" In the mean time, with Uber working on building its own maps of Australia's cities -- a very valuable piece of the self-driving car future that Google and Tesla are also pursuing -- Lyft's vision may be on the back foot locally. If it ever comes at all, that is. UPDATE: March 22, 2017, 6:05 p.m. AEDT Update added from Didi and Grab.  ",

      "content": "Anyone who has ever been a caregiver for an aging loved one is well acquainted with the anxieties that accompany such a role: Is Nana safe while home alone? Is mum's bedroom warm enough in the middle of winter? Is grandpa wandering out of the house in the middle of the night?   There are currently 3 million UK citizens tasked with a seemingly impossible juggling act every day: Balancing a full-time job with caregiving responsibilities. One in six individuals in the UK, in fact, ultimately chooses to give up work in order to care for an elderly loved one --which has a significant impact upon a caregiver's ability to go about daily life, as well as a ripple effect upon families.     Howz, a startup that pairs home-monitoring technology with a routine-tracking app to keep families connected with their elderly loved ones, hopes to ameliorate some of these common issues.   The app taps into existing systems such as a home's electricity meter, and uses machine learning and long-term analytics to track daily activity patterns -- all without requiring use of a wearable or invasive devices. Eventually, the app may also pair with a variety of smart-home devices to provide a more robust activity profile. Howz products can be purchased online, and a trained installer will come to users' homes to walk them through the system (self-installation is also an option). Upon set-up, the Howz team speaks extensively with users to develop a custom-tailored monitoring plan based on individualised goals and living situations.   Louise Rogerson, the company's director of service development, says that this holistic approach to  routine-monitoring is not only effective, but that it's also one of the most affordable such systems on the market today. Rogerson, who comes from a background in neurophysiotherapy, also touts the technology's minimally invasive nature: Most of the data points that Howz monitors (electricity usage, home temperature, etc.) are already being recorded in most people's homes. More data  -- door movement, light levels, etc. -- can easily be monitored without an obtrusive or complicated device. Then, Howz brings all of the information into a single ecosystem.    \"It became very clear early on that we needed something passive that wasn't a wearable--so that the house could do the talking,\" Rogerson tells Mashable. \"We needed something that didn't require a huge effort [on the part of the user]. That's where the combination of movement, daily routine, etc. comes in--that's the key indicator for me, as a therapist, when somebody is starting to have a problem. Way before I see anything else, I see that.\" Sometimes, says Rogerson, simply making people aware of activity patterns can lead to improvements -- or raise red flags before a situation becomes dire. The technology can be particularly helpful for personnes with early-stage dementia.  Image:   The Howz team comes from a varied background. Jonathan Burr, the company's CEO, comes from a past life in finance and traffic data analysis. The team also employs a mathematician and an R&D specialist to help build out the app's algorithms and analytics. Obviously, as the company continues to grow -- Howz currently has fewer than 100 active users, but hopes to eventually become commonplace technology in thousands of homes -- it will need to scale accordingly. There are already plans in place for anticipated growth, says Rogerson. In February, Howz was awarded the EDF Energy Pulse Award for Connected Home and Business. As a result, the company received a PS30,000 grant, as well as support from Blue Lab (an innovation accelerator programme), to determine the optimal way to bring Howz into homes on a large-scale level. \"We've got quite a clear vision of where we can go with this,\" says Rogerson. \"There are already countless hypotheses that monitoring [change to routine] is important -- and more clinical research coming out agrees. Our product is able to do this extremely well.\"  ",

      "content": " The health food revolution has seen many of us take a keen interest in what we put into our bodies -- we're more conscious than ever of eating the right things. That doesn't mean we're not all craving a chocolate bar or two though, and there's a UK startup that's putting our favourite naughty snack onto the health food shopping list. iQ Chocolate is the company creating healthy chocolate \"from bean to bar\". Their produce is free from all 14 allergens - including nuts, gluten, wheat and soya - and is low on the Glyceamic index, meaning it won't send your glucose levels soaring. The sweetness of the chocolate comes from organic coconut blossom nectar - which is a superfood itself. It's naturally high in potassium, magnesium, zinc and iron, giving you a healthy boost in vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and C. Chocolate never looked so healthy.  Image:  iq chocolate Founders Kate and Jane describe themselves as \"the kind of folks who want to live for a very, very long time and enjoy the journey\". It's this ethos that underpins the ideas at the heart of iQ Chocolate -- who says you can't eat your favourite foods and be healthy at the same time? After all, the cocoa bean at the heart of chocolate is one of the world's most nutritiously dense foods -- how it ended up at the centre of the health and diabetes crises common in the developing world has to do with the way it's farmed and processed later down the line.  Image:  iq chocolate iQ Chocolate set out to cut the journey from bean to bar, retaining the health benefits of the cocoa bean in its natural state while hitting on a recipe that tastes as good as the chocolate on our supermarket shelves. This proved to be something of a challenge -- co-founder Kate told Mashable that the team of two \"were wrestling with the art and science of making chocolate from the bean -- in the old traditional ways -- testing the results every step of the way.\"   With the help of the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health at Aberdeen University Kate and Jane tried and tested various beans. \"Start up gear included a hair dryer, colander, tin dustbin lid and a washing machine, set at 1400 revs\" Kate recalls -- although thankfully this method is now a distant memory. Following rigorous testing the company finally became Scotland's first bean to bar chocolatier. This rigorous testing went on for some time. Manufacturing became an issue once the company hit on a formula they thought would impress the masses -- and boost their health. Unfortunately as is the case with many budding startups, funding and interest barriers got in the way of a smooth journey to success, and Kate and Jane ended up pooling their own funds to begin the manufacturing process themselves, and their early products weren't a treat for all tastebuds. After hearing \"well, it's OK\" from those with chocolate know-how a few too many times, the pair headed back to the drawing board and eventually got the seal of approval from top chef Mark Greenaway -- his approval sealed the deal.  Image:  iq chocolate When iQ Chocolate eventually hit the shelves, it was Real Foods in Edinburgh and Glasgow's Whole Foods Market that gave the company its first business. Fast forward to today and the company has two stars in the Great Taste Awards and is delving into the chocolate's application in the sporting world along with its potential to slow cognitive decline in old age. The chocolate is now stocked in 13 countries across the globe, and Kate and Jane's plans for world domination are the driving force behind their business's expansion.   ",

      "content": "Uber has been weathering quite a storm lately, but the ride hailing company wants to remind you: It also builds technology, and not just serious sexism scandals. On Wednesday, Travis Kalanick's beleaguered startup officially launched a new navigation system for its drivers. Features include lane guidance, next turn previews and real-time traffic information. It's also introduced a night-time look to make the app easier on the eyes in the dark. SEE ALSO: Hey law students: Want a job? Well, you better learn to code. Rolling out on both iOS and Android, the tool will give Android users access to in-app navigation for the first time. Previously, the latter would have to switch out of Uber's app into Google Maps or Waze to plan their route. On iOS, the update has begun in some cities, but its launch on Android is still in its early stages. According to Maya Choksi, a senior product manager at Uber, the aim is to provide drivers with an optimal navigation experience. One of the main complaints from drivers on Uber's iOS app was small font size, she said, but in the past, Uber had little say in how street labels appeared. That was because the company used a number of different mapping APIs \"to kind of cobble together\" in-app navigation.  \"There were a number of things that were really suboptimal about this,\" she explained. \"We had no control over the size of [street] labels or which labels show or don't show. We couldn't control necessarily the name of the street where the driver is supposed to make a right turn.\"  Image:  Uber Now the team controls more of the mapping stack, and they're able to customise it specifically for the needs of Uber, UberX, UberPool and UberEats drivers -- a far more complicated set of directions than your average commuter trip. If drivers want, they're still free to use the mapping app of their choice. Manik Gupta, head of products in Uber's Maps team and a Google Maps veteran, said the new stack used mapping providers including TomTom to \"mix and match\" with Uber's own proprietary data. The new driver navigation will not involve increased tracking of driver data, he added, although route data information always been collected.  \"From a Maps perspective, you really want to model the real world as closely as possible. So the more data and the more detail you get about that, the better off you are,\" Gupta said.  Image:  Uber Both Uber staffers stressed the rollout isn't perfect. \"We're are still learning, we are getting tons of driver feedback,\" Gupta said. For now, for example, the navigation will not immediately re-route when there's traffic ahead in the way Waze does. The bigger question may be where the navigation tool fits with Uber's self-driving car ambitions. While Gupta would not comment directly, granular features such as lane guidance seem to hint in that direction. Monetising the project by licensing it to third parties was also \"not on our radar.\" Of course, Google is currently suing Uber, accusing the company of stealing self-driving car secrets, but Wednesday's roll out is not about abandoning its historic reliance on Google Maps. According to Uber, anyway. In fact, Choksi said Uber had never used a Google base layer map in the iOS driver app -- a point confirmed later by an Uber spokesperson -- and Gupta added the company continued to use Google for rider-side search. \"If [a rider] searches for something, it's powered by Google,\" he said. \"There's no real solution that really works for us, that's the whole point.\" Under the guidance of former Google Map executive Brian McClendon, Uber launched a global mapping effort in mid-2016 to build maps \"tailored to the Uber experience.\" The project has involved putting cars on the road akin to Google Street View in countries from Australia to Singapore.

Now it is in the spotlight for all of the wrong reasons.   It all started when an anonymous blogpost entitled 'The Indian Uber - That is TVF' was published on Medium on Sunday.  Under the pseudonym of \"Indian Fowler\" (inspired by Susan Fowler, the former Uber employee who cataloged harrowing details of sexism in the company), the writer recounts two years of alleged \"abuse and molestation\" by Kumar. She writes: \"I was in a meeting at Arunabh's house with three other women. The meeting was taking place in the hall of the apartment. Arunabh left the meeting in the middle and went inside. Since he was gone for quite a while, I went inside the next room to call him. Suddenly, I felt someone from behind grope my breasts, and when I turned around, it was Arunabh.\"  She also mentions the time when she'd been called back to office after work hours and subjected to lewd conversations, including references to \"red light districts\".  The allegations prompted other women to publicly share similar accounts on social media:  Reema Sengupta, a Mumbai-based digital content startup co-founder, described Kumar as a \"sleaze\" who creeped her out. In a Facebook post she alleges that Kumar touched her inappropriately several times during a shoot -- \"grazing his hand against my waist\" and \"touching my shoulder tattoo.\"  She says she \"couldn't wait for the shoot to be over\". Another woman, Reshma Patra, working with a global consultant firm who met Kumar with work back in 2012, claimed that he once requested her to come home and strip.  She writes: \"Arunabh asks me: \"Would you go to my place, and dance for me\"? I was like WHAT? I thought he was being funny. But NO, he was Serious. :) He said he would like to get naked & see me stripping & dancing *for him*. He also told me that....he is fond of girls from Calcutta; he has \"made out\" lot of times, with random girls in 'Cal'.

We did send out an instant response, which may have been a bit too quick & emotional.  We recognize that we should have handled that response better. However, it is a fact that we have found no records of any such person on our pay roll, in that given time period, as described in the blog.\" The company adds that it is \"committed to getting to the bottom of these allegations\" and is \"sincerely looking into each one of them.\"    ",

      "content": "Thousands of Indonesian women are launching a new breed of mom-and-pop shop -- one that's entirely contained within a phone or tablet.   A startup called Slingshot lets anyone apply to launch a three-dimensional virtual storefront with the country's biggest retailer, Alfamart. Through micro-franchise agreements, owners can stock their shelves and display racks with any assortment of items from Alfamart's inventory, which includes household wares, clothing and groceries. Sales are made in-person only, and the wares are shipped upon purchase from the shopping chain's warehouses.   SEE ALSO: Netflix teases a gadget that lets you browse with just your brain The set-up is supposed to add a social touch to the online shopping experience and provide a more comfortable setting for people who still prefer real-world stores to the internet. It's also meant to be accessible with the minimum possible initial investment.   A screenshot of the inside one augmented reality store. Image:  slingshot The company claims 7,000 people have now signed up in the eight months since it launched, and 60 percent of them have stayed active users. All but two or three percent happen to be women. Slingshot CEO Daniel Surya says the predominance of female users is a function of prevailing cultural norms that often make it difficult for women to start their own businesses.   SEE ALSO: Amazon's fulfillment centers will soon run on solar energy The company was one of five startups chosen to represent the country at the South by Southwest festival in Austin this week, during which it will announce a global expansion targeting other emerging markets. Most of the businesses operate on the same sort of scale as a tupperware party -- customers are usually neighbors, acquaintances or anyone else the store owner might come across in a social setting.  The stores also have an augmented reality component, where users can decorate a tiny scale model of a building. Image:  instagram:aditafebriyanti Surya said the product is most popular among mothers looking to bring an extra stream of household income. He says a lot of the transactions take place in social settings, like among mothers waiting for kids after school or during neighborhood get-togethers. Some of the more prolific of the business owners seem to be bypassing the storefront altogether and coordinating sales to a wider audience through social media. The company plans to roll out a feature soon that will let owners mix in goods of their own into their inventories alongside those supplied by Alfamart.  The idea is to eventually get to the point where the storefronts are more akin to shops on sites like Etsy with the opportunity for owners to launch their own products on the back of their franchise. From Alfamart's perspective, the benefit comes not just through the added sales but also through valuable word-of-mouth marketing intrinsic to the model. As it strikes out into new markets in the coming months, it will look to make similar partnerships with local retailers. The business model latches onto what's seen as one of the most appealing business prospects of virtual and augmented reality -- the ability to create virtual showrooms in which to sell things with the same intimacy and accessibility of a brick-and-mortar setting without the burdensome costs or logistical restrictions. The product as it is now is far from the most advanced example of this practice, but Surya said it was designed with wide accessibility in mind among people who might not have the latest gadgets.

      "content": "On this International Women's Day, women are striking to make clear their value in the workplace, at home and beyond. That includes the tech world.  According to the Department of Labor, only 26 percent of people employed in computer and mathematics jobs are women. And a big chunk of that 26 percent comes from outside Silicon Valley.  Despite the challenges facing any engineer who doesn't fit in with the testosterone-fueled culture of Silicon Valley, many women have made their mark in the field -- and fought to make it better.  On International Women's Day, it's worth celebrating a few of the tech world's badass women.   Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe. Image:  noam galai/Getty Images for TechCrunch Whitney Wolfe left her job as a co-founder at Tinder amid allegations of sexual harassment at the company, but she refused to quit the dating app game. Instead of going quietly, she founded Bumble, the app that gives women control when swiping.  Not only did Wolfe help create two of the biggest players in online dating, but she did it on her own terms. Bumble has expanded beyond dating to matching friends on Bumble BFF, and raised $40,000 for Planned Parenthood in January. Not bad!   Laura Weidman Powers at SXSW. Image:  jealex photo/Getty Images for SXSW Laura Weidman Powers is one of the tech industry's strongest advocates for diversity. With CODE2040, she supports young black and Latino engineers, working to ensure they are proportionally represented in the field.  Weidman Powers also served in the Obama White House as a senior policy advisor to the chief technology officer.   Ellen Pao. Image:  maria aufmuth/Getty Images for Massachusetts Conference for Women Ellen Pao ran Reddit, and before that she was a junior partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers.  Her name might sound familiar because she sued that company for gender discrimination. Pao lost the suit, but she brought sorely needed attention to bias in Silicon Valley tech culture. She is the cofounder of Project Include, a nonprofit that provides recommendations for startup management on how to build more diverse companies. Laura Gomez is an advocate for diversity in tech, and supports that mission in her day job, too. As CEO of the people analytics tool Atipica, the Twitter alumna helps companies use data to strategize in hiring. That includes using data to help companies build more diverse workforces.   Slack's Erica Joy Baker. Image:  noam galai/Getty Images for TechCrunch Erica Joy Baker is one of the women behind Slack, the communication tool that has taken over offices nationwide. A former Googler, she splits her time between her roles as a senior engineer at Slack and as an advocate for diversity and more widely accessible tech education.  She also helps translate tech -- and the problems within it -- to the outside world by blogging about diversity, racism and life as a black woman in Silicon Valley.   Reshma Saujani at Advertising Week in New York. Image:  robin marchant/Getty Images for Advertising Week New York Reshma Saujani founded Girls Who Code, the powerhouse nonprofit that has helped to make coding education -- and its gender gap -- more visible. Saujani has run for office and recruited high-profile ambassadors to Girls Who Code, like supermodel Karlie Kloss.   Unlike that other ride-hailing company with all the problems with its treatment of women, Lyft has an awesome woman at the helm. Jill Wetzler is the director of engineering at Lyft, which she joined after stops at Salesforce and Twitter.  Recently, Wetzler told USA Today College that her best career advice was to \"know your worth.\"  \"If I feel stuck, or underutilized, or if I feel like I'm not getting to have the type of impact that I think I can have, I remind myself to know what I'm worth,\" she said. \"Sometimes, that reminder causes me to do something bold.\"  Black Girls Code founder Kimberly Bryant at Glamour Women Of The Year 2016. Image:  mike windle/Getty Images for Glamour Kimberly Bryant founded Black Girls Code to give young women of color the opportunity to learn the skills to succeed in the tech industry. Bryant has a long resume in tech and has prioritized supporting the next generation along with her own work.  So if I can prioritize diversity + inclusion w/ a TINY budget and as a Black woman CEO. I see no excuses for others. None. #DoBetter -- Kimberly Bryant (@6Gems) October 16, 2015 Arlan Hamilton founded Backstage Capital, a venture capital firm that invests in startups by women, minority and LGBT entrepreneurs. Her portfolio of startups is impressive, and committed to her initial vision. And Hamilton got Backstage Capital off the ground, despite lukewarm responses from mainstream investors, while she was homeless.  Hamilton has emphasized that her firm isn't a nonprofit -- it's trying to make money, just like its competitors. But Backstage Capital is able to do that by finding the best ideas from groups who often don't get the support they need to get started.  Belinda Johnson has been called \"Airbnb's Sheryl Sandberg.\" As chief business affairs and legal officer for the home-rental giant, she helps craft the company's approach to regulators and woos its hosts to act as Airbnb's biggest supporters. Johnson has years of experience guiding the legal affairs of internet companies, including in the early days of Yahoo. As Airbnb's CEO grows his public profile, Johnson is running things behind the scenes.  Stacy Brown-Philpot is the CEO of TaskRabbit and an alumna of both Google and Goldman Sachs. At Google, she was the senior director of global consumer operations and ran sales operations in India. Along with running one of the major players in the gig economy today, she serves as a board member at Black Girls Code.   Tracy Chou at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2015. Image:  steve jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch Tracy Chou is an engineer and alumna of Pinterest and Quora. She also helped spur tech companies to disclose diversity statistics through a Github project that collected numbers on women in engineering. Today, most major tech companies publicly share diversity information about their workforces -- and Chou's repository played a big part in that.     ",

      "content": "Back when the iPhone was a mere twinkle in Steve Jobs' eye, \"culture\" didn't mean all that much in Silicon Valley. Now, it means even less.  While a fair and equitable work community is worth striving for, endlessly mentioning your company culture is a tired marketing ploy, and one that many women in tech have known to be only lip service for some time now.  The c-word is invoked to provide cover. It's a box to tick. It may be tech's favourite buzzword, but it's time to give it up.  SEE ALSO: Uber's Travis Kalanick: Yep, I'm a jerk, basically Just how insincerely \"culture\" is used has become clear in the wake of Uber's most recent set of scandals concerning its allegedly top-to-bottom bro workplace, not to mention the endless drip of lawsuits brought by women and people of colour at companies from Tesla to Tinder. Some companies are quietly equitable, but at this point, we all know that tech \"culture\" is most often a byword for the type of workplace meritocracy that functions only because everyone looks the same.  Companies certainly walk a fine line when talking up their workplace culture suggested Kai Riemer, a professor at Sydney University's business school. After all, what's ideal for some may be considered too demanding and exploitive by others. While things are improving, the low number of women and people of diverse backgrounds in technical roles at most major tech companies will give you a good idea of just who the culture is working for. \"They create a pressure-cooker environment in many cases to get the most out of the talent they're attracting, and they pay them back with a lot of perks and a kind of inclusive, feel-good culture,\" Riemer said. \"I think it's no secret that the workplaces are demanding and what is portrayed as image may not always hold up on closer inspection.\"  Men crowd around a new car during a technology news conference. Image:  John Locher/AP/REX/Shutterstock Of course, some companies can be set apart. \"Uber as an example might be a special case, because they haven't quite sailed on the wave of being a force for good or a positive employer,\" Riemer added. \"Uber has always had the image to be quite ruthless when it comes to dealing with competitors, policy and being ignorant of anything that stands in their way. I think that was kind of deliberate because they wanted to be seen to be a disrupter.\" Uber CEO Travis Kalanick's recent remarks about \"creating a workplace where a deep sense of justice underpins everything,\" suggest he may wish he'd invested earlier in that culture capital. Natasha Hawker, founder of human resource consulting film Employee Matters, is not quite ready to give culture up, although she admits people are increasingly cynical about the term. \"People know at the moment they need to talk about culture -- it's a sexy word -- but I don't think people define culture the same way,\" she said. In her view, a good workplace is one with strong communication -- a diverse, flexible business where wins are celebrated. \"It doesn't have to be complicated,\" she added.  \"There is a natural kind of utopian mindset that sometimes has gotten ahead of itself.\" You do, however, have to earn the right to claim company culture as an asset. \"I think it needs to be evidence-based. If they can back their claims with evidence and they articulate that culture through advertising and the interview process, then OK,\" Hawker explained. So, what does someone who still seems mostly fond of the word think? Julio Avalos, chief business officer at GitHub, acknowledged Silicon Valley has more to learn while in Sydney visiting local startups. \"I think the Valley has had issues with some of that, where there is a natural kind of utopian mindset that sometimes has gotten ahead of itself,\" he said.  Of course, the San Francisco-based code management platform has faced accusations of gender-based harassment itself in recent years. Avalos argued the company is now better placed to be sensitive to the concerns of employees and users, pointing to the company's dedicated community and safety team, among other initiatives. \"I think GitHub has learned a lot over the last several years around how to be more of a grown up organisation,\" he said.  While he used the word culture freely -- \"What is the GitHub culture? How do you maintain that culture?\" -- Avalos suggested the aim was not to impose the company's ethos where it doesn't fit. \"It's not about exporting a cookie cutter model to the rest of the world ... I don't think it's about thinking we have all of the answers and that we have all the solutions,\" he added. That would suit Riemer: \"I think Australian tech companies by and large are known to have pretty good work conditions as it is, so I don't think we need any lecturing to by American companies,\" he said. And that's the crux of it: Silicon Valley's soft power message about the halcyon beauty of its workplaces feels increasingly disingenuous to the rest of the world, even hypocritical. Ending the c-word abuse and simply building a better workplace would go a long way towards restoring faith.  In other words: We look forward to reading all your diversity reports. And hearing nothing more about your great culture, thank you so much.  ",

      "content": "Sites like Yelp give us options when it comes to the restaurants we visit or the doctors we see, but that choice hasn't been equally shared. Founded by two women in Melbourne, Australia, Clickability is an online directory that allows local disability care and support options to be listed, rated and reviewed.  Dubbed a \"TripAdvisor for disability support services,\" the concept may sound simple enough, but Jenna Moffat and Beecher Kelk's plan is ambitious: The pair hope to make customers out of those with disabilities -- empowering them to pick and choose what works for them, rather than simply having to accept what's on offer. SEE ALSO: People with disabilities destroy stigma on Twitter with #DisabledAndCute Beecher Kelk and Moffat came up with the idea while employed as social workers. They noticed they kept drawing on their professional networks or using Google when trying to find other carers and support networks for clients.  \"We were gatekeeping so much information, I was literally calling people I did my Masters with to ask about homelessness services, for example, or domestic violence services,\" Beecher Kelk said.  Clickability puts information on disability services in one searchable place. After a pilot program in the Geelong region in 2014, it expanded to cover the rest of Victoria, and in March, it launched in New South Wales. Importantly, the startup's mission aligns with the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), a significant social welfare project for people living with disabilities currently being rolled out by the Australian government. \"We just saw this huge gap there in terms of consumer rights ... In this industry, that's a gap in human rights as well,\" said Beecher Kelk. As Beecher Kelk pointed out, people with disabilities on the NDIS are in many cases expected to make their own decisions about which support service to choose. \"Government money used to go to service providers to distribute services, and it's now going to individuals to purchase the services that suit themselves,\" she explained. Under the NDIS, support services will have to think about people with disabilities as customers. That means they have to start considering themselves competitively, she suggested, and putting work into marketing and customer service in a way they may not have before. \"Likewise, consumers have to start thinking about themselves as customers. How do I assert my customer rights? How do I articulate what I need? How do I get what I need?\"  Unfortunately, in her view, the information to back up that decision-making is just not there, and it's certainly not the kind of relevant, reliable peer-generated information that exists in other industries. That's where Clickability comes in. Kelk believes the site can reach profitability by allowing service providers to subscribe, although it will need an investment boost in the meantime. To list and rate services is free on Clickability, but subscribers can reply to comments and personalise their page, among other features. The pair are now working on the project full-time, with the assistance of paid and volunteer staff. With more than 1,000 listings currently across Victoria and New South Wales, they hope to expand the platform nationwide. Beecher Kelk also has ambitions to improve the accessibility of the site itself. In the next few weeks, they hope to deploy changes that will make it easier to use for people with low or limited vision. \"The big thing for us is how do we make this accessible for people with intellectual disabilities?\" she added. \"We also collect [reviews] in-person sometimes at conferences and events from people with all sorts of different access needs. It's really important to us to find a way that everyone can have a voice.\" Beecher Kelk said Clickability is most of all about empowering people with information. \"We just saw this huge gap there in terms of consumer rights,\" she explained.  \"In this industry, that's a gap in human rights as well, because we're not talking about 'I won't go back to that restaurant,' we're talking about 'I won't be able to get up in the mornings.'\" [h/t StartupSmart]  ",

      "content": "Not long ago, it seemed unlikely anyone would be comfortable sleeping in a stranger's house or riding in their car. That idea is now the foundation of multi-billion dollar companies. To get there, Airbnb and Uber basically commodified trust, largely by allowing users to review each other as a form of accountability and, until now, Australian online jobs marketplace Airtasker followed a similar route. The platform allows people to bid for jobs, like assembling furniture or mounting a television, similar to America's TaskRabbit.  SEE ALSO: Uber's SVP of engineering is out after Recode surfaces previous sexual harassment allegation According to Tim Fung, founder and CEO of Airtasker, building accountability from scratch is not always efficient. A partnership announced Tuesday between his company and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) will aim to import some old-school trust into the gig economy. For joint customers, a \"CommBank Identified\" badge can be added to their Airtasker profile as part of a pilot program, indicating their name and date of birth have all been verified by the bank. In other words, if you hire \"John Smith\" to mow your lawn, you can be pretty certain it's in fact John Smith knocking on your front door. \"We don't necessarily have to try and build trust with people from the ground-up again,\" Fung said. \"Because I think that these huge databases of information, whether it's the road and motoring authority, whether it's the banks, whether it's other people that you've worked with -- all these people are storing components of your 'trust or reputation passport.'\"  Brian Fung and Pete Steel. Image:  Airtasker For Fung, trust is a spectrum. When he started Airtasker, he accepted they'd be the type of place where you'd hire someone to hand out fliers, but not necessarily to find a babysitter. \"As we've grown, we've become more ambitious,\" he said. \"We've launched police checks this year, which is a badge you can have on your profile, we've launched the CBA partnership, and we'll have more.\" Pete Steel, executive general manager of digital at CBA, said the opt-in pilot was about \"stitching banking and digital economy together.\" It allows joint customers to transfer their good standing with the bank to a new digital platform, he suggested, and could extend to similar sharing economy platforms in the future. As well as verifying identity, the badge could indicate other things about your relationship with the bank -- although Steel wouldn't elaborate on what exactly those would be.  \"Maybe you're a five-star customer, a three star-customer, maybe you have a certain balance sheet with us,\" Steel explained. \"We've thought about some of those things but we want it to be customer-driven.\" While he couldn't say how many customers CBA and Airtasker shared, Steel pointed out the bank has a relationship with almost one in three Australian adults. Airtasker claims to have more than 950,000 users.  That's a sizeable number who could have misgivings about their financial privacy. The market dominance of CBA also means that checks and balances are essential so that customers with spotty bank histories don't find their past haunting them on new platforms. \"All these people are storing components of your 'trust or reputation passport.'\" Steel said customer comfort was foremost in their mind. \"We're very conscious of wanting to turbo-charge the sharing economy, not really constrain anyone,\" he added. Fung also emphasised no financial data would be displayed on the site. Of course, the pilot also begs the question: should the banks be the arbiters of trust for the gig economy when Australians don't always trust them? A 2016 study by Ernst & Young found that only 36 percent of traditional bank customers in Australia had complete trust in their provider.  Steel pushed back on the bank's bad press. \"Fundamentally people still have, I think, a very good view of the bank and the role we play,\" he said. \"For both someone like Airtasker and us to do this sort of partnership, we not only shake hands, we think about the brand affinity as well -- is it a natural pairing that customers will find appropriate?\" As banking gets shaken up by fintech startups, he believes there may be an additional role for financial institutions in providing, as Fung put it, a \"trust passport.\"  \"Trust and security are right at the centre of who we are -- it's one of the things a bank should do well,\" Steel said. \"We certainly are in a good position where we know a third of adult Australians. And so how can we help them grow their businesses and meet financial goals in this emerging digital economy?\"  ",

SEE ALSO: Ex-Uber employee shares harrowing tale of sexism at the company Since then, other women stepped forward with similar stories and the company's investors are now demanding action. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick held an all-hands meeting Tuesday, in which he promised change throughout the company, and announced that he'd enlisted former US Attorney General Eric Holder with conducting an investigation into the matter.  But the \"smear campaign\" against Fowler has begun, she said in a tweet Friday afternoon: Research for the smear campaign has begun.

I am so humbled by and thankful for the overwhelming support I've received today. Wow. So many thanks to you all. -- Susan Fowler Rigetti (@susanthesquark) February 20, 2017 My twitter and gmail apps are longer working thanks to all the messages! It will take me a while to reply to everyone but I will try! -- Susan Fowler Rigetti (@susanthesquark) February 20, 2017 Fowler's original tweet about her story received 22,000 retweets, and set off a furious news cycle about her claims.  I wrote something up this weekend about my year at Uber, and why I left:  https://t.co/SyREtfLuZH -- Susan Fowler Rigetti (@susanthesquark) February 19, 2017 Over the last week, her name's become synonymous not just with alleged company-wide gender discrimination at Uber, but within startup culture at-large.  Uber itself has even named Fowler in emails to users, in response to customers who specifically referenced the latest allegations when cancelling their accounts. The number of account-deletion requests following the publication of Fowler's blog post have been low, according to an Uber spokesperson.  That doesn't mean the world is completely against Uber--some employees who work there have started to come out in defense of the company over the last week. In response to \"What do engineers at Uber think of Susan Fowler Rigetti's blogpost of her year at Uber?\" on Quora, Travis Addair, a senior software engineer at Uber, wrote: \"I personally suspect that Susan's account is accurate from her perspective, but I also suspect there's more to this story that even she was not aware of. But that's just speculation on my part, at the end of the day I don't know any more than anyone else.\" Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment when asked whether they have been in touch with Fowler directly. If they do, we'll update the story here.  ",

      "content": "If you thought tech companies were succeeding, even incrementally, at creating more inclusive workplaces, it's not entirely your fault. Headline after headline suggests that influential Silicon Valley executives understand they have a problem and are working to fix it. But a serious scandal like the one Uber now faces, following damning allegations of sexual harassment and corporate negligence, is all it takes to shatter the optimism. And this one likely won't be the last. SEE ALSO: Horrific harassment story is giving the internet a new reason to #DeleteUber The truth is that while some of the biggest names in tech -- Facebook, Yahoo, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Airbnb -- at least nominally support inclusivity by releasing annual diversity reports, we don't know much about what they're doing to change their male-dominated cultures. Dozens of other startups and companies stand idly by, perhaps happy to enjoy the glow of perceived progress without publicly working for it. Meanwhile, a female engineer like Susan Fowler Rigetti (who goes by Susan J. Fowler on her blog) may find herself in an abusive work environment where sexual harassment goes unpunished and the victim becomes the pariah. She recently documented her jaw-dropping experiences at Uber in a blog post. \"If you have poor practices...these things are going to drive people -- not just women -- out of your organization.\" Inviting scrutiny, though, is risky for tech companies. They have to answer for stalled momentum as well as embarrassing claims that they can't transform their own culture. But until the majority of them make a genuine, transparent commitment to diversity, reports of discrimination and harassment will continue to plague the industry.  The upshot is that when tech companies put their might behind setting new norms, they quickly become reality.   \"That's happened with free lunches and busses,\" says Alaina Percival, CEO of Women Who Code, a nonprofit that supports female engineers. Those may be easy perks to promise employees, but they spread across the industry because they attract talent. Aggressively tackling the diversity problem has the same appeal, but doing it effectively, says Percival, requires sharing more than just hiring figures by gender and race and broad outlines of company policy.  What people really need to know is how companies, for example, detect biased language and decision-making in performance reviews, promotions and compensation -- and how leadership reacts when it discovers those trends. Companies may be tracking those metrics privately, but Percival doesn't know of any that have publicly released the information.  \"If you have poor practices around performance reviews and harassment and promotion, these things are going to drive people -- not just women -- out of your organization,\" says Percival.  Tracking those measures can reveal evidence that management stifles or is hostile to women and other staff members of underrepresented backgrounds. Human resources may be loathe to search for bias in the company's ranks because it might present legal issues, but pretending it doesn't exist is exactly how some talented employees flail, or are perceived as incompetent, while others become stars.  That probably sounds familiar to Fowler Rigetti. In her blog post about Uber, she claims that after reporting her male manager to human resources for sexual harassment, she was given the option to stay on his team but would have no recourse if he wrote her a negative performance review.  2/ I've instructed our CHRO Liane to conduct an urgent investigation. There can be absolutely no place for this kind of behavior at Uber. -- travis kalanick (@travisk) February 20, 2017 Fowler Rigetti decided to leave that team for another. When an internal \"game-of-thrones political war\" left her wanting to transfer again, that move was blocked for \"undocumented performance problems.\" After fruitlessly trying to contest that decision, Fowler Rigetti says she learned her manager kept her because it made him look good amidst the flood of female engineers trying to leave their toxic teams. In other words, when it became convenient for a manager to prize diversity, she was a useful prop.  Uber's CEO, Travis Kalanick, said on Twitter the behavior Fowler Rigetti described was \"abhorrent and against everything we believe in.\" On Monday, Kalanick sent a memo to his employees outlining an urgent investigation of the matter and arguing that the ratio of female engineers it employs is comparable to Facebook and Google.  \"I believe in creating a workplace where a deep sense of justice underpins everything we do,\" he wrote.  \"The more influential people in companies that work to change that, the faster you'll change societal norms.\" Arianna Huffington, the media mogul and Uber board member, quickly became an integral part of the investigation. After an all-hands meeting on Tuesday, she acknowledged the long, difficult process of identifying the rot that may infest the company's culture.  \"I hope that by taking the time to understand what's gone wrong and fixing it we can not only make Uber better but also contribute to improvements for women across the industry,\" she said in a statement.  While that's great spin, it'll take a lot for Uber's investigation to make a significant difference for women across tech. Instead, most will probably have to endure the status quo until something dramatic, like a scandal, embarrasses their own employer. Even that's unlikely because a lot of women, Percival says, won't share their experiences publicly because they fear the personal and professional repercussions. Percival hopes that more executives and their staff embrace diversity in principle while also developing specific measures of success that go beyond hiring numbers -- and sharing them with the industry. The blueprint for this already exists, including in materials provided by Project Include, an initiative cofounded by Ellen Pao that offers startups several key recommendations for integrating inclusivity and diversity into the DNA of their companies. (Pao, when she was the interim CEO of Reddit, famously sued the venture capital firm where she previously worked for discrimination and lost.) \"The more people, and the more influential people, in companies that work to change that,\" Percival says, \"the faster you'll change societal norms.\"  The best minds in tech would scoff at fixing a product piecemeal, based only on public outcry over its failings. Now it's time for them to realize the same strategy won't work for their company culture.   ",

Now, they're on a mission to transform medicine \u2013 by digitalizing it.\u00a0Practicing an acute trauma craniotomyImage:  GIF via touch surgeryTouch Surgery, a UK-based medical training startup, has developed an immersive surgical simulator that replicates complex procedures, breaking them down in steps. It's available in app form, allowing users to transform their fingertips into scalpels on the go. That way, surgery newbies can attempt complex procedures all they want, without risking actual lives. The next step is to deliver the immersive and freakishly realistic 3D animations in VR form.Practice makes perfect.Traditionally, young surgeons don't really get any trial and error sessions before they step into the operating room. It's kind of like learning to fly a plane without using the flight simulator.This is changing, thanks to apps like Touch Surgery. After visiting their enormous two-floor space, I attempted a simple hand surgery, step by step, in thin air, while wearing a HoloLens headset.\u00a0No patients were harmed in the writing of this article.\u00a0The simulation itself is pretty straight forward and your actions as a digital surgeon are limited. You can only strictly follow the steps outlined. So no impromptu incisions. You also can't see what happens if you do something wrong like puncturing a vein. (So it's nothing like the board game Operation.)This makes the simulator a bit constrained and rigid in its virtual representations, but maybe that's the point. Touch Surgery is supposed to prepare surgeons for the specific steps they need to take on the operating table. It's about helping them improve their decision-making and making it as close to the real thing as possible. \u00a0Image:  GIF via MashableThe Touch Surgery office harnesses far more than strictly medical expertise. There are people coming from the visual effects industry (more specifically, the world of Star Wars), mobile and gaming developers, and graphic designers.\"We\u2019re able to replicate 3D anatomy and 3D surgical process to a really high degree of fidelity. And we use that to put surgeons into the right mindset to make sure that they\u2019re making decisions as realistically as possible,\" Dr. Chow said.\u00a0A post shared by Touch Surgery (@touchsurgery) on Sep 1, 2016 at 11:08am PDTThey are now collaborating with universities and hospitals to fine-tune and expand the procedures that can be simulated. There are already over a hundred. Touch Surgery has also been picked up by John Hopkins University as part of the procedure evaluating novice surgeons.\u00a0The app itself has grown in popularity, with over a million users around the world. Interestingly, a significant number are actually patients. Dr. Chow said Touch Surgery has the added benefit of allowing patients to actually see what the procedure that they are undergoing would look like. That demystifies surgeries from the patient's point of view, which tends to be entirely limited to just before being put to sleep and right after waking up.\u00a0The ultimate goal is going global, with the incredible spread of smartphone use across the world.Precision is key.Image:  GIF VIA TOUCH SURGERY\"There are around 7 billion people on the planet, but 5 billion people don\u2019t have access to safe surgical services,\" said Dr. Chow. \"That\u2019s why we created Touch Surgery \u2013 to be part of that story that helps scale surgery to really meet global demand.\"\u00a0Essentially, what the simulator is intended to do is transform access to surgical training and achieve a sense of equality in surgical training around the world.\u00a0In other words, one day you won't need to find the best surgeon to perform a complex brain surgery or hand transplant, because surgical services, uniformly, will be able to provide care at a very high and risk-free standard.\u00a0\"Ultimately,\" Dr. Chow said, \"we want to be at a stage within the next five to ten years, where we can be saying that what Touch Surgery does saves lives.\"",

      "content": "We\u2019re halfway through the week, and it\u2019s time for a boost of inspiration to keep us going. Our #WednesdayWisdom blog series taps into the minds of industry leaders and disruptive visionaries who are working to build the future of entrepreneurship.This interview comes from our partners at Project Entrepreneur, as part of their #WednesdayWisdom blog series featuring industry leaders and disruptive visionaries who are working to build the future of entrepreneurship.We sat down with Susan Lyne to discuss the evolution of the tech industry, a woman's buying power, and the challenges women face when pitching male investors. Susan is the President of BBG Ventures, an early stage fund focused on consumer internet and mobile startups with at least one female founder.What originally sparked your interest in female consumers?When I started working in media back in the mid 70\u2019s, no one talked about data \u2013 everything we did was by instinct: what do we think people want to read about? Will this cover line be a magnet for readers? But it didn\u2019t take me long to realize that women bought many more magazines than men did, and that you could grow your circulation by talking to them.When I went to ABC the conventional wisdom was that women would watch shows made for men, but men wouldn\u2019t watch shows for women - so everyone was chasing the next Law and Order, the next CSI. I walked into a meeting one day and heard the woman running our comedy department bemoaning the fact that Sex and the City was going off the air. She said, \u201call my shows are gone,\u201d meaning shows like Ally McBeal, Melrose Place, SITC, that women gathered to watch together and talked about the next day. It was a wakeup call for me \u2013 and we decided to buck the conventional wisdom and go after the next \u201cgirl\u201d show. Out of that development season came Desperate Housewives, Grey\u2019s Anatomy and The Bachelor.I went from ABC to Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia to Gilt.com, companies that delivered something unique to women and in the process built strong brands and loyal followings. Women make the final decision on 85% of all consumer purchases - and they\u2019re increasingly the early adopter and power user of new tech platforms and services. Women should spark everyone\u2019s interest!Where did the inspiration for BBG Ventures begin?It goes back to my time at Gilt. I joined the company in 2008, the year after the iPhone launched. We didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but that was a transformational moment for entrepreneurs because it put a computer in everyone\u2019s pocket. NYC was starting to emerge as a tech center, and the city attracted a different kind of female founder \u2013 women who were reimagining every aspect of home and work life to be more efficient, more productive, or just more fun.\u00a0That first wave included companies like LearnVest, BirchBox, Paperless Post and, of course, Rent the Runway. Raising money was a challenge because 95% of venture investors are men. So before they could get to the meat of their pitch, they had to explain how women think about their closets, or why we\u2019re always on the hunt for the next great beauty product. I thought: let\u2019s back the best of these female founders, who inherently understand the end user \u2013 what she needs, what she wants, what will delight her.At BBG Ventures you believe the greatest untapped opportunity for venture capital lies in backing women. Why women?A few reasons: first, women are the dominant consumers \u2013 and not just in the obvious areas like apparel and food, but insurance, computers, cars, home purchases, medical care. We\u2019re also the power users of most new consumer tech platforms and services. So it makes good sense to back entrepreneurs who know that end user, especially since the majority of venture investors aren\u2019t hunting there. Pattern recognition leads VCs to get more excited by someone who looks like Mark Zuckerberg. That\u2019s an advantage for those of us who are focused on women.From your experience, what does having at least one female founder do for a company?At consumer-facing companies, it ensures that there is someone in a decision-making position who really gets how and why women will use the product. We invested in a company called Hop, Skip, Drive \u2013 a ride service for kids founded by 3 working moms in LA. When we made the investment, there was a better-funded competitor in SF. That founder skimped on background checks and spent his money instead on marketing. HSD knew the #1 issue for customers (moms) would be safety; so from day one they fingerprinted every driver. Two years later, the SF company has folded, and HSD is thriving.It's still early days but there\u2019s also evidence that teams with a female founder have better outcomes. First Round, one of the oldest early-stage VCs in NYC, did a look-back at their first 10 years of investing and discovered that companies with a female founder performed 63% better than all-male teams. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising: research has consistently shown that diverse teams drive better results because they\u2019re more likely to challenge assumptions. That forces you to focus more on facts and to process information more carefully \u2013 and gets you to better solutions.When you hear a pitch, which is most likely to convince you to invest: the person, the product, or the revenue potential?The ultimate gating factor is always going to be the person: do we believe that this founder can take the product all the way? No business, no matter how successful it may look from outside, has gotten there without serious bumps in the road. The founder is going to face days when nothing is working. She needs tenacity and grace; conviction and a willingness to try something new. It\u2019s a tall order.Why do you think it\u2019s taken so long for people to focus their investment strategies on female-led business ventures?I think it goes back to the way the tech industry has evolved. I read an interview with Marc Andreeson a few years ago where he talked about the origins of the Silicon Valley startup scene, when the customer for your product was a big tech company. Founders came out of engineering programs or CS programs. It wasn\u2019t until the focus shifted from enterprise to consumer that women began starting companies in large numbers. Add to that the fact that less than 5% of venture partners are female and you start to see why it\u2019s been an uphill battle.What do you see for the future of women in business?I see blue sky ahead. We just need a few big wins. Once we have a few examples of women-led companies successfully going public, or being acquired for billions of dollars, it will put to rest the rest the silly arguments about whether women can compete in this marketplace. And you\u2019ll see a lot more venture capital chasing female founders. We\u2019re close to that moment.What\u2019s your advice to women who are asking themselves whether their product is worthy of pursuing venture funding?Ask yourself whether your product solves a real problem faced by millions of people (the market size); whether people or companies will pay to use it (your business model); and whether you are the first-mover or have proprietary technology (competitive advantage). If the answer to those things is yes, start working on a deck!",

The survey of Level39's 900-strong community found that most think a shortage of talent is the biggest threat to banks and financial institutions in the UK (19%), followed by a lack of investment in research and development (17%) and digital disruption (15%). International competition (15%) was also highlighted as a major risk to the capital's financial sector. Financial technology (26%), machine learning (22%) and data analytics (20%) were the three verticals expected to receive the most investment across the tech sector in 2017. 30% of those surveyed said UK banks and institutions urgently need to invest in cyber security in order to \"regain a competitive advantage\", yet only 13% thought that it would outperform other verticals for investment this year. Data science (28%) and financial inclusion (17%) were also cited as areas in need of funding. 90% of respondents agreed that if banks work together with London's tech community to overcome obstacles and invest in these areas, the capital will have an ecosystem capable of \"producing a critical mass of globally successful tech start-ups\". Ben Brabyn, head of Level39, commented: \"London is a global financial powerhouse, but its dominance in financial services is under existential threat. Failing to address these billion-dollar problems will send the industry hurtling towards a cliff-edge. The time for spectators is over - banks need to open their chequebooks and invest in the tech startups offering the innovations they need. \"Investment from the world's largest financial services IT budgets will realise the potential of billion-dollar ideas in fintech, cyber security and financial inclusion.

While the report found strong anti-Brexit sentiment among tech business leaders with 49% in opposition, 8% higher than the opposition average of other business sectors, 36% of tech CEOs asserted optimism about Brexit and believe it \"will help their chances of winning new business\". Despite positive findings for the future of the UK's tech industry - now valued at over PS161bn - many of the tech businesses interviewed by Albion reported concerns about finding skilled staff (a challenge for 48%), accessing new markets (31%), and changes in the political climate (30%).

      "content": "Britain's tech leaders have called for the launch of a high-skilled visa to protect the country's tech businesses, following findings of a new report which suggest there will be a 800,000 shortage of vital skilled workers by 2020 without government action. Commenting on the report A Global Britain, from local startups to international markets - which found that nearly one third of UK tech companies' first 10 hires are from outside the UK - The Coalition for a Digital Economy (Coadec) has warned that government restrictions on skilled overseas workers \"risk choking off\" the tech sector. The policy group has claimed that this \"choking\" could have a damning effect on the UK economy as the digital tech sector currently accounts for 16% of domestic output, 10% of all UK jobs, and received an estimated PS6.7bn investment in 2016. The economic contribution of the country's construction and automotive industries pale in comparison - the UK's construction industry accounts for 6% of all jobs while the automotive sector received PS1.66bn investment in 2016. Given the recent boom of the tech industry, Coadec has argued industry leaders are fearful that post-Brexit, and with new curbs on immigration from the EU, the UK could face a \"critical shortfall of digital workers\" unless ministers take steps to speed up the flow of international talent. Apparently, Britain needs 2.3 million digitally skilled workers by 2020 to fulfill the country's digital potential. Coadec's proposed solution is for the government to create a six-month high-skilled tech visa which would allow qualified people to enter the UK and work for digital tech businesses... To qualify for the visa, the migrant would have to have studied at a designated institution or have passed a standardised, high-level exam in specific programming languages. After the six month period, if the migrant does not a receive a job offer they would have to return home. If an employer wished to hire them, the report recommends that people on the visa should be exempt from the Resident Labour Market Test; dubbed \"the biggest drag on start-ups' time and growth potential\". The report has urged the government to pilot the visa scheme with a small number of highly trusted tech companies, who would endorse other companies. Once through this process, start-ups would be able to hire Tier 2 workers. On the visa proposal, Alex Depledge MBE, chair of Coadec and co-founder of Hassle, said: \"If Britain is going to succeed in a post-Brexit world, the UK's tech sector must be able to hire global talent. That means a smart visa system that enables the best and the brightest to come to the UK from wherever they are in the world.\" Jan Hammer, Index Ventures, continued: \"The message to the UK government is simple. The most vital ingredient for the success of high-growth startups is the availability of talent. Visa rules that make the hiring process time consuming and costly, will make the UK and its start-ups less competitive.\"   ",

This is double the volume recorded in 2015, with the number of attacks on company firewalls surpassing a record average of 1,000 per day across  November 2016. Last year also saw an advance towards \"more sophisticated\" cyber attacks, with IoT devices that can be controlled remotely - such as networked security cameras and building control systems - becoming popular targets. In the first quarter of 2016, a third of attacks targeted company databases. However, by the end of the year, 90% of attacks attempted to access IoT devices, following a 310% increase in such attempts between the first and final quarter of the year. Beaming has also recorded an increase in inbound cyber threats from outside the UK, with 98% of the unique IP addresses used to launch attacks against UK businesses originating from oversees. Sonia Blizzard, managing director at Beaming, said: \"The majority of internet cyberattacks are computer scripts that search the web for weaknesses and probe firewalls constantly for a way in. \"With the Internet of Things, businesses are punching holes in their own firewalls to provide suppliers with access to devices on their networks. This can open the door to criminals too if not done properly. \"It is imperative that companies regularly review their firewall policies to ensure they are as restrictive as possible and prioritise security over convenience.\" For advice on how to protect your business from cyber attacks (including those targeting IoT devices), see our guide.

      "content": "London is the most important technology hub in Europe, according to a new survey published today from venture capital firm Balderton Capital. The comprehensive report, titled The European Talent Landscape, revealed that London's tech has attracted EUR8.9bn in investment between 2011 and 2016; more than that of any other European city. Tech businesses in Berlin, ranked as the second fastest-growing tech centre, have received EUR6.58bn in investment since the start of 2011, while tech companies in Paris - ranked third - have received EUR4.58bn. Dublin was also found to be a significant tech hub, housing the eighth highest number of tech start-ups in Europe - despite ranking relatively low in terms of investment. Among oversees job hunters, London was found to be the most popular search location for tech roles. The UK capital's mobile workforce was shown to be a driving factor in the growth of its tech sector with 40% of London tech companies boasting a non-UK founder. However, whilst evidencing London's current success, the report highlighted Brexit's potential to reverse the city's winning streak. Though the UK is currently home to 31% of European start-ups, the report predicts that this number could drop to 24% if Europe's mobile tech talent becomes less inclined to migrate to the UK following Brexit. The report also highlighted that, if policies towards skilled workers change after Brexit, the costs of recruiting staff who need visas could hinder the growth of many tech start-ups. The Referendum result created so many doubts and concerns that in July, Tech London Advocates and London & Partners launched a post-Brexit email support service for tech start-ups. The report's suggested impact of Brexit shouldn't be disregarded, as the report highlights that UK tech salaries had already dropped sharply since the UK voted to leave the EU on June 23. James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital, commented: \"London, together with Paris and Berlin, dominate the tech scene in terms of employees and investment today. \"But the relative weakness of the pound since the referendum vote, together with developers' willingness to be mobile and work in smaller tech hubs, could reduce the relative advantage the capital enjoys without proper policy support post-Brexit.\" Looking to build a business in London?

The letter, signed by founders and executives of Tech City Future 50 companies and alumni such as Deliveroo and Mind Candy, suggests that founders and tech employees are concerned that Britain's exit from the EU will hamper their ability to hire talented tech staff and will deter tech talent from wanting to come to join, or set-up, tech businesses in the UK. In the letter, published on Tech City UK's website here, the founders explain that as the \"UK has become a number one spot in Europe for tech start-ups, with 40% of all European tech unicorns (companies valued at $1bn or more) based here [...] hiring international talent is essential to growth\". The letters goes on to read: \"If tech communities were no longer able to recruit workers from the 27 EU countries, or from other states, many businesses would see their growth slow down. Government measures in recent years to encourage founders and entrepreneurs to invest in the UK would be wasted. \"As tech company founders we want to work with government to find solutions to the digital industries' need for international talent.

Announcing its latest milestones at a breakfast event held by Instagram this morning, Amy Cole; head of brand development EMEA, revealed that the social media giant has achieved over one billion actions related to its ads including link clicks, downloads and more, and has opened up its advertising from eight countries to 200. See also: How to utilise Instagram for business Since the launch of Instagram Business Tools two months ago, the platform has seen 1.5 million businesses convert their pages into a business profile, proof, Cole says, of the \"strength and power Instagram has to help businesses\". Cole also revealed the findings of recent research of its user base which shows that 50% of 'Instagrammers' follow a business while 60% have learnt about a new product or service using Instagram as a discovery platform. Discussing Instagram's progress since it opened up its advertising platform last September, Cole said: \"Half a billion people are now using Instagram, they're coming to connect with people around the world. 80% of users are outside the US.  [...] Instagram is now really looking at how we can get brands to engage. [...] We've done a lot of work on flexibility and the way businesses can tell their story. [...] We launched business tools [two months ago] which has just been incredible. We've seen over 70% of the direct response campaigns we've run generate an uplift in direct action. [...] Instagram ads are actually working and driving business but it's only early days. [...] We're not done yet!\" For businesses that aren't sure of how to capitalise on Instagram to promote their brand, Cole explained that Instagram is investing in marketing and email campaigns to help businesses understand what 'good' looks like on the platform. You can also visit business.instagram. com for inspiration and case studies. At the breakfast event, Startups.co.uk also heard from three start-up brands - Vinaya, Floom, and SilkFred - on how they've used Instagram to promote their business. Floom founder Lana Elie explained that before launching her florist-based tech business in February of this year, she actually created an Instagram account for Floom to test whether it had market potential and said that Instagram, over every other social medium, worked best given that her brand is \"very visual\". So how can you use Instagram to promote your business? Here are a few steps, as outlined by the Instagram team: On closing the event, the Instagram team noted: \"Using Instagram, a big company and a small company have the same tools - it gives them a level playing field. Small businesses always have to promote who they are and every single bit of their marketing budget has to count for something. Instagram ads allow them to tell their story.\" ",

The survey of more than 3,700 working professionals found that 40% of the UK's female tech workers are employed in the capital, with women in London more than twice as likely to work for a tech start-up than women in the rest of the country. As a whole, London's tech community was found to provide better opportunities for women - 33% of tech businesses said they have initiatives in place to recruit more women, compared to fewer than 25% of tech companies outside of the capital. The survey findings weren't all rosy though. At least 10% of tech firms in London were found to employ no female workers and over 50% had workforces that was less than 15% female. These findings were echoed in a recent study by Tech London Advocates which found that 18% of London tech firms still have no women on the board and follows Startup.co.uk's recent feature on why it's time we stopped talking about gender diversity in tech and actually did something about it. To coincide with the research, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for better representation of women in the tech industry: \"The capital is the most important tech hub in Europe with its vibrant mix of investors, talent and creativity. Although the sector is flourishing, it is vital that we actively encourage more girls to work in digital and tech to reverse the under-representation of women in this industry.\" Russ Shaw, founder of Tech London Advocates, has also commented on the issue: \"Despite a range of highly successful female founders and CEOs in London, senior roles and management teams at digital businesses have more of a 'boy's club' factor. For a sector driven by the need for highly skilled and creative talent, failing to harness those currently under-represented makes bad business sense.\" ",

      "content": "Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. (Flickr Photo: Stuart Isett/Fortune Most Powerful Women)\n Editor's note: Utrip CEO Gilad Berenstein has attended Berkshire Hathaway's annual board meeting in Omaha, Neb. for the past two years. Berenstein, who was named GeekWire's Young Entrepreneur of the Year in 2015, attended this year to observe and hear from Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett and Vice-Chairman Charlie Munger. Below are his impressions of the meeting. I was fortunate enough to attend my second Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting this past weekend in Omaha. For those who have not been, the format may be surprising. Forty thousand people, from every profession and nationality, line up in the early hours of Saturday morning to run into the arena and grab a seat \"close enough to see the facial expressions on Warren's face,\" a shareholder waiting in line at 6:15 a.m. told me. 8:30 a.m. Intro Videos: These videos include a sample of the best TV commercials created by Berkshire companies that year -- funny videos of Buffett and Munger with celebrities on famous TV sets or performances with prominent musicians. It concludes with a thank you video to the executives of all the Berkshire companies. 9:15 a.m. Buffett and Munger come on stage, introduce the board of directors, show one slide of financials and explain the format. 9:25 a.m. The Questions Begin: For roughly six hours (with a one hour break for lunch) Buffett (86 years old) and Munger (93 years old) answer about 50 questions -- one third from journalists, one third from financial analysts, and one third from shareholders who have lined up to ask a question. These questions are on a huge variety of topics including macro and micro business and economics questions, questions about individual businesses or sectors, politics and policy, investment advice, life advice, and more. The quotes below come from their answers to these questions. 3:30 p.m. Formal Meeting: Basically everyone skips this part.  This is one of my favorite Buffetisms because it's so true -- execution is all that matters. The most brilliant business strategy is merely a talking point without successful execution; something I think can easily be forgotten. When discussing this point Buffett referred to Amazon and CEO Jeff Bezos several times. He talked about Amazon's execution and operational capabilities as second to none. Buffett also referenced Precision Cast Parts and said the company and CEO's intense attention to detail in the execution phase is what makes them the industry leader. Just watch the clip.  Buffett explained that a sustainable business needs a mote and a good knight in the castle to fight off invaders. I love this point and I augment it with a famous Bezos line: \"Be customer-focused, not competitor-focused.\" If there's no one else interested in your space, how good of a business opportunity is it anyway? This is a great question that I modify slightly for the particularities of the startup world - If you had no pressure from partners or investors, what would I actually do to grow your business? Another question Buffett likes to ask CEOs: \"If you had to invest all of your money in one of your competitors who would you invest in and why?\" Munger was talking about investing when he said this but I think this is just as applicable to entrepreneurs. This is probably the most important thing said all day. One should remember this both personally but also when thinking about the life of a startup. This last one is a bonus, more about investing than startups, but is still incredibly thought-provoking. Munger and Buffett said multiple times at this year's meeting, \"Investment is harder now because of our national obsession with finance. Back then it was all low-hanging fruit.\" I found this fascinating. Because of our \"national obsession,\" there are so many more players investing in businesses and an entire industry (Private Equity) that exists to take them over. Buffett and Munger went on a bit of a tirade about the evils of Private Equity, which they refer to as leveraged buyouts and the \"outrageous\" 2/20 payout structure these funds command. \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman in Seattle on Friday. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota)\n Speed kills may be a popular saying. But don't tell that to LinkedIn co-founder and newly-appointed Microsoft board member Reid Hoffman. In his view, the ability to harness speed as a weapon is one of most important characteristics of successful Silicon Valley companies, and it is a tactic he encourages his companies to deploy. \"There is no modern Silicon Valley company that doesn't actually, in fact, have kind of these speed genetics built in,\" said Hoffman, who spoke Friday at the Technology Alliance annual luncheon in Seattle. \"So, scale fast.\" In fact, Hoffman is such a big believer in the concept that he uses the term \"blitzscaling\" to define how companies can use speed to their advantage. It is also the name of an entrepreneurship class that he's taught at Stanford University, and it's the subject of a new podcast that he's launching with those who've built companies that scale super fast. Companies can survive without blitzscaling, but it would take some luck, he said. He defined the term as deploying \"what seems to be a ridiculous amount of capital quickly in order to scale your customer acquisition, your organization and your market size ... in a way that would generally be considered inefficient by like a classic MBA class.\" Companies such as Airbnb and Uber are classic blitzscalers. And Hoffman said it is very hard to compete with those companies which have decided to take the blitzscaling approach, because \"they can throw a huge shadow\" on those who are not using the tactic. Hoffman also talked about the importance of OODA loops, a fighter pilot's term that stands for Observe, Orient, Decide and Act. Just as the fighter pilots that have a faster OODA loop have a higher chance for survival, so do startup companies. Hoffman said that Silicon Valley is the only place in the world where OODA loop is used in a business context, though he noted that Chinese entrepreneurs would also use the term too if they had it in their parlance. \"Individuals and organizations throughout the Valley talk about their OODA loop, their learning, the speed at which they are moving, etc. because they feel that that speed is critical,\" said Hoffman, who is also a venture investor at Greylock and has backed companies such as Seattle's Convoy. You can see Hoffman's remarks on entrepreneurship and blitzscaling starting in minute 21 of the video below.  Also from the Reid Hoffman fireside chat: \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Waccal co-founders Anil and Ashfaq Mohammed. (Waccal Photo)\n The process of landing meetings and pitching investors can be burdensome for time and resource-strapped startups. Brothers Ashfaq and Anil Mohammed wanted to come up with a solution to that problem for other entrepreneurs like themselves. The result was Waccal, a Kirkland-based startup that launched last month. Waccal is a platform where entrepreneurs can post their pitches and get feedback from other users. Investors can scan startup profiles and connect with entrepreneurs that catch their attention. Waccal also allows investors to manage their portfolio companies and collaborate with team members on potential investments. \"Entrepreneurs have a tough gig,\" said Waccal CEO Ashfaq Mohammed. \"They must validate if people actually want their product or service, be nimble enough to pivot via customer feedback and market testing, pitch investors to raise capital, manage current investors, gain momentum behind them and their brand, oh and of course, build their product or service. Waccal makes this process efficient so founders can focus on what's important -- growing.\" He shared details on the brand-new startup with GeekWire for this Startup Spotlight, a regular series. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"Waccal is a launch pad where startups come to pitch their idea, find the right investor, and build a strong capital foundation before it takes off and grows.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"We realized that the private equity market is inefficient and old. Founders make it their full-time job to raise capital for their startup, going meeting after meeting only to realize that there was no alignment with them and the investor, after the fact. This type of ecosystem increases the cost of capital and inadvertently reduces a startup's chance for success.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Bootstrapped from the beginning for research and development of our technology. We have been gaining a lot of traction and are developing strong relationships with Angels and VCs. Can't wait to have our profile up on Waccal to seal the deal with the right investors.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"The Waccal community. It's the entrepreneurs with startups that are going to change the world as we see it, investors who want to help startups succeed by providing capital and asking tough questions, and surfers who are the early adopters of new products and services. An investor once told us \"'t takes a village to raise a child,' the village is the Waccal community.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Is to not fall into the trap of creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). We instead created a Minimum Loveable Product (MLP). We invested time and energy in creating a great experience for our users, that is rooted by efficiency, accuracy, and beautiful design. This is what will motivate our users to come back to our site and continue from where they left off. If we didn't provide a great user experience, we aren't fixing the problem that we intended to solve.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"We didn't use the right tool, in the beginning, to create a mock-up for our website design and functionality. When we found the right tool, it caused a bunch of rework and we lost two weeks of precious time.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Bezos! He is an amazing strategist. He started from an online bookstore and ended up with the world's largest online retailer. If you were to draw an activity map of all the things Amazon is involved in, such as AWS, films, and online retail, it will look like all of this is unrelated. But it's not, it all ties into big data analytics. Amazon can leverage this data by sensing what the consumer wants and pivot its corporate strategy accordingly. Similarly, at Waccal we are just as focused on our users and want to continue to build on providing technology that will make them more efficient in the private equity market.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Golf! It's always fun wearing golf attire, smacking golf balls as hard as you can, and driving golf carts.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"If you can think big, are curious, self-motivated, disciplined, and eager to take on fresh challenges, then you are a future Waccaler!\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"If you are making excuses, then find something else to do because you will always find excuses that limit the growth of your startup.\" ",

(GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop)\n LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman built a technology giant in Silicon Valley, but he has been spending more time in Seattle recently as a startup investor and Microsoft's newest board member. Hoffman offered his observations about the two tech hubs as part of a wide-ranging talk this afternoon at the Tech Alliance annual luncheon. Interviewing Hoffman on stage, tech executive and angel investor Sarah Imbach asked Hoffman what he was learning from Microsoft's scale and focus, and applying to the rest of the work.  \"Silicon Valley tends to be very myopic -- to be focused on one or two things, which has some strengths as well as weaknesses,\" Hoffman said, observing that Microsoft Surface devices and HoloLens headsets tend to be afterthoughts in Silicon Valley compared with Mac laptops and Oculus Rift headsets. But he said he has been impressed by the \"depth of tech\" in the Seattle region. He explained, \"I think it would be useful for Seattle and Microsoft to be more in that discussion, and it's going to be something I'm going to try to help with. But the learning was, 'Hey, there's a bunch of really good tech up there.'\" People in Silicon Valley should factor that into their thinking more than they currently do, he said. Hoffman also cited ongoing work by Microsoft to partner with Silicon Valley companies. \"Part of what I have done already in the last couple months is made some connections, and said, 'Hey, yeah, there's a really great technology here -- maybe you guys should have a conversation, because actually that partnership could work for both of you.'\" He added that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has \"done a great job\" of building a \"we-can-partner-with-you culture.\" Hoffman noted that Silicon Valley can be \"naive\" about a lot of things. \"Silicon Valley tends to be: Like, build one product, everyone in the world uses it, just be technologically utopian and don't adjust to local regulation or local politics... There are strengths to that too, but there are also weaknesses,\" said Hoffman. \"I think actually one of the things I have already taken from people like (Microsoft president) Brad Smith and others is that: 'OK, how do you try to get to a blended strategy, where you have some strengths on both sides, and is that a more adaptive and a better way of growing.'\" The LinkedIn co-founder is an investor in companies including Seattle-based Convoy, which won Startup of the Year at last night's GeekWire Awards.

      "content": "BigStock Photo.\n Ever feel like there's just too much information out there? New York-based Agolo is hoping so. The startup is developing a program that summarizes large amounts of information using artificial intelligence -- and it's one of two AI startups that announced new funding Wednesday from Microsoft's corporate investment arm, Microsoft Ventures. Agolo's funding, first reported by VentureBeat, was a $3.5 million seed round co-led by Microsoft Ventures and Bay Area firm CRV. The second Microsoft Ventures investment is Berkeley, Calif.-based Bonsai, which develops an AI platform that helps companies build their own intelligent enterprise tools. Bonsai announced a $7.6 million round of funding Wednesday co-led by Microsoft Ventures and Maryland-based firm NEA. While the timing of the investments is a coincidence, they do point to Microsoft's dedication to artificial intelligence technology. The company has a robust internal AI R&D program, and Microsoft Ventures started a fund dedicated in \"AI companies focused on inclusive growth and positive impact on society\" in December of last year. \"It's still early days for our AI fund, but with a plethora of amazing startups out there, I'm confident in our ability to find and support more startups that are responsibly harnessing the power and promise of AI,\" Nagraj Kashyap, corporate vice president at Microsoft Ventures, wrote in a blog post announcing the funding. \"By investing in startups like Agolo and Bonsai, Microsoft Ventures is supporting Microsoft's commitment to democratizing AI and empowering people and businesses for years to come,\" he said. Bonsai's platform has been used to automate systems including robotics, manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, energy and utilities. The company also announced a new Early Access Program on Wednesday, designed to help companies introduce enterprise AI systems. Agolo's tech uses artificial intelligence in a very different way. The startup's platform uses natural language processing to \"read\" texts selected by a user. The algorithm then makes connections between the texts and \"writes\" a summary of the information. Agolo co-founder and CEO Sage Wohns told VentureBeat that the company is already partnering with some of the world's biggest media companies. \"There's a crucial need for making sense of the world's information and Agolo is filling that void. Our platform partnerships with our investors have helped us become indispensable to media companies -- it's hard to find a media company we don't work with. And there are broader applications in diverse sectors, including financial services,\" he said. The company isn't alone in its quest to turn creative processes over to AI. North Carolina-based Automated Insights is working to write \"human sounding\" articles from pure data, for example. And Microsoft is in good company in Seattle's AI world -- last year, Apple acquired Seattle-based machine learning startup Turi, and has opened an AI-focused engineering center in the city. Research at the University of Washington and the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence is also driving Seattle's AI scene, with spin-outs like Kitt.ai starting to build an AI startup ecosystem.

      "content": "Chris Neumann, general partner, 500 Startups\n It's really hard to take a deep technology idea and nurture that idea until it grows into a real business, especially with the pressures of modern tech venture capital. 500 Startups thinks it can make that process a little easier. Starting this July, 500 Startups will launch a data-startup oriented track for startups working on big data and machine learning problems. Chris Neumann, who had been advising 500 Startups on this topic since January as entrepreneur-in-residence, is now joining the incubator as a venture partner and will lead the track. \"The current model doesn't work for enterprise data companies,\" said Neumann, who founded DataHero and sold it to Portland-based Cloudability last year. \"Maybe it takes longer than 18 months to build your MVP (minimum viable product), and once you layer on top of that enterprise sales cycles, it turns into something very different\" than experienced by the consumer-facing social media apps so popular among incubators and venture capitalists over the last few years. Also, founders of deep technology companies tend to be, well, immersed in deep technology problems and less aware of what it takes to turn a product demo into a customer pilot and eventually a sales commitment, Neumann said. VCs won't fund small companies until they've demonstrated at least some traction, and first-time founders with great tech ideas often need help getting the business part off the ground. 500 Startups will bring in several advisers to help startups in this track, and applications can be submitted here.

(Ventec Life Systems Photo)\n Imagine for a moment that your spouse, parent or child has been diagnosed with a life-changing condition. They need constant support from a ventilator to breathe. Traditionally, that means they would need to be attached to a bulky machine, possibly stuck in a hospital bed. And if they were able to return home with a portable ventilator, they would need constant care and assistance. That was Doug DeVries' experience when his father was diagnosed with ALS eight years ago. But DeVries has something not everyone in that situation would: a long career developing ventilation technology. So he set out on a mission to make a better portable ventilator system that would be easier for caregivers to use. DeVries founded Ventec Life Systems four years ago to make the tech he had been working on a reality. His system, called VOCSN, was just approved by the FDA and now the startup has raised a $7 million round to bring it to market, bringing their total funding to date to $28 million. A Ventec spokesperson said all the company's funds so far have been raised from family and friends, many with backgrounds in respiratory care. \"I've seen firsthand how improved ventilator technology can enhance the quality of life for patients and caregivers. Our team didn't want to create just another ventilator, we spent the past five years focused on building a truly integrated solution,\" DeVries said in a news release. The VOCSN system combines ventilation, oxygen, cough, suction and nebulization (medication delivery) services in one device, and allows a user to switch between services using the exact same hardware. That means a patient using a ventilator doesn't have to switch to a different machine to clear their lungs of fluid or take breathable medication. Ventec says the system's combined technologies make it easier to use than alternatives. It also reduces the risk of complications, like infection, that arise from constantly switching devices. A spokesperson for the startup said the goal of the tech is not just to improve patients' quality of life but also to help caregivers, like a child or spouse, spend more time with the patient instead of constantly attending to a ventilator. Ventec will now work with its partners to start a slow roll-out of the device, with the first systems shipping in the U.S. in June. The startup is based in Bothell, Wash., where it carries out all stages of design and manufacturing. It currently has 35 employees. ",

Arzeda's customers are using the technology in areas like agriculture and manufacturing. \"We are also using the technology to develop our own innovative products,\" said Zanghelini. \"We're looking forward to the day when industrial, environmental and health challenges are routinely addressed by designing the perfect molecule for the job.\" Arzeda is made up of a team of computational biologists -- Doctors Eric Althoff, David Baker, Daniela Grabs, and Zanghelini. Their work has been published in the academic journals Science and Nature. We caught up with Zanghelini for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"Arzeda uses synthetic biology and cloud computing to make the products we need more sustainable, perform better, and cost less.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"While at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design we realized how we could use cloud computing to sort through trillions of possible combinations, design new enzymes and assemble them into the best biochemical pathways to make custom-designed molecules. We published our results and founded Arzeda the same year.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Bootstrap. Bootstrapping at first allowed us to experiment a lot in the marketplace and find the best commercial applications of our technology. It allowed us to gain solid traction in partnerships with large Fortune 500 leaders in their business. Bootstrapping also forced us to have the discipline to develop a very lean operation (we did not have running water when we started our lab operations). It's very rare in biotech, and we are very proud of that. We all worked hard to accomplish this and it certainly had an impact on our personal lives. Long term, to reach the scale we envision, we will need outside capital. But having paying customers, proof that the technology works and a lean organization is what any investor wants to see.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Our secret sauce is found in the tight integration we have built between the latest biotechnology techniques and extremely powerful computing. That's why our geeks (software developers) and lab-rats (molecular biologists) work side-by-side in the same open space. We could choose to be a biotech company, or we could choose to be a software company, but the combination is what makes Arzeda greater than the sum of its parts.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Getting off the ground. Starting a company to build a synthetic biology technology platform that nobody has ever used before sounds like a big lift -- and it is -- but once we got started the momentum has carried us. Also, not spending $50,000 on a branding firm to create our name. We did it by rearranging the initials of the founders until we landed on something that sounded biotech-y.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Some of our deals have taken longer to arrange than we expected. This is a brand-new technology, and countless industries can make use of it. It takes time to communicate the full potential.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"We use AWS for our cloud services so the shout-out goes to Bezos. Still, all three of these guys know what it takes to innovate something entirely new. Maybe we can find a way to isolate the most successful genetics of each?\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"We are headquartered in a Seattle neighborhood with loads of new microbreweries. It lends itself very well to team-building.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"A strong alignment with our values, and a vision for synthetic biology and its potential to change the world for the better.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Running a startup will have an enormous impact on your personal life, so make sure what you are working for is worth the stress. That's what we have done and the ride has been great. We wouldn't want to be doing anything else.\" ",

(Nextio Photo)\n Aravind Bala had been at Microsoft for nearly 15 years when he met Anoop Gupta, his manager on the Office Mix team. After working together for a couple of years, they began kicking around startup ideas. Eventually, they came up with the concept for Nextio, a platform that pays users for responding to messages from recruiters and offers other career-related insights. \"Every day you receive messages from people outside your social networks,\" Bala said. \"A message from a recruiter about your dream job is very valuable to you. One from a Nigerian prince who wants to share his treasure -- not so much. Companies and individuals are spending real money to reach you ... but all of this money is going to a middleman.\" Nextio officially launched earlier this month, with Bala serving as Chief Technology Officer. \"I wear multiple hats at Nextio from architecting the product and writing code to talking to customers, working with legal and hiring,\" Bala said. \"About 70 percent of my time is spent in coding and working on the product, and 30 percent on strategies for getting traction and program management.\" During his 16 years at Microsoft, Bala was as a partner engineering manager on a wide range of products, including Bing and Office. We caught up with Bala for this Working Geek, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Current Location:  \"Redmond, Wash.\" Computer types: \"I use a Windows workstation at work and a Mac Pro for my laptop. I work with a lot of data for the Career Insights tool, and we have built a custom in-memory database which requires a ton of RAM, and so my main machine has 64 GB of RAM. Having worked at Microsoft for most of my career, I'm very used to Windows machines, but I wanted to try a Mac Pro for my laptop to get used to the Apple ecosystem.\" Mobile devices: \"I had been alternating between iPhone and Windows Phone while I was at Microsoft, but now I'm just using an iPhone. My current phone is an iPhone 7s, and I love the battery life and the screen.\" Favorite apps, cloud services, and software tools: \"Microsoft Office is my favorite productivity tool, in part, because I can hack it to do anything I want. In my previous jobs at Microsoft, I built a feature to be able to search over all the commands in Office and as part of that, I became familiar with every single feature in Office. At work, we use Visual Studio, Microsoft Azure, Node.js to build our software, and GitHub and Zenhub to manage our work items, issues and for project management. Zenhub is really great to manage our tasks on top of GitHub. We also use Slack for team communication.\" Describe your workspace. Why does it work for you? \"I have an identical computer setup both at work and at home with two 27-inch monitors. At work, we have an open space and it's great for collaboration, but when I need to get stuff done or work on hard problems I like to work from home without any distractions. Working in a small team at work is a lot of fun since we all get along great, and it's energizing to bounce ideas off each other. We also go out for lunch every day as a team and try out new restaurants. It's a nice break during the day, and it's great for team discussions.\" Your best advice for managing everyday work and life? \"Working in a startup tends to be all-consuming, but it's really important to carve out dedicated time for the family. I try to get home by 6 p.m. every day so that I can spend a few hours with my kids and wife, and then usually work later in the night after they have gone to sleep. In a startup, you are always severely under-resourced, so it's critical to prioritize to ensure that you work on the tasks that give you the maximum return for the amount of effort you have to put in.\" Your preferred social network? How do you use it for business/work? \"I use our platform Nextio for messaging, as well as Whatsapp and Facebook to keep in touch with friends and for articles of interest. I follow several people on Facebook who share interesting content, but given that Facebook tends to keep showing you stuff that you like, it's important to go out to other sites that might have the opposite viewpoint.\" Current number of unanswered emails in your inbox? \"Since we are a small team, we do most of our discussions in person, and sometimes Slack. We don't use Email as much, and so I only have 10-15 unanswered emails in my inbox.\" Number of appointments/meetings on your calendar this week? \"Depending on the phase of the product we are working on, I might have a lot of meetings or very few. Within the team, we do not usually have formal meetings, but we sync up every day when everyone is in the office. This week I only had one formal meeting, and several interviews as we are looking for a great software developer.\" How do you run meetings? \"We typically have two types of meetings - one about work items and priorities which are best discussed by working off a task board like Zenhub/GitHub, and brainstorming meetings that are more open-ended. While it is great to have robust discussions on various topics, it is important to designate an owner for the agenda item who can listen to all the arguments and everyone's feedback, but make the final decision.\" Everyday work uniform? \"Jeans and T-Shirt.\" How do you make time for family? \"I try to get back home by 6 p.m. every day so that I get to spend some time with them before my kids go to sleep. I also carve out some time to spend with my wife where we usually end up watching some TV before starting to work again at night.\" Best stress reliever? How do you unplug? \"The best stress relievers for me are playing tennis and listening to comedy. Instead of the typical garage startup, our office is a pool cabana. We have a tennis court next door. When the weather is good, it's great to get a half an hour of tennis in during the day. At home I love playing with my kids - we usually play tennis or cricket inside our house or in the backyard, and watching our favorite shows on TV with my wife.\" What are you listening to? \"In the morning, during my commute, I listen to the radio. My favorite radio station is Movin' 92.5 FM which plays the latest music and I love their morning show, 'Brooke and Jubal in the morning.' I find that listening to comedy in the morning puts me in a good mood for the rest of the day. I also listen to various podcasts on startups and user growth. My favorite podcast for startup-related topics is 'This Week in Startups.'\" Daily reads? Favorite sites and newsletters? \"I read the headlines on CNN and MSNBC, and get some of my news from Facebook. I also keep abreast of tech news at GeekWire, TechCrunch, and I subscribe to various startup-related newsletters like the Launch Ticker, the CB Insights newsletter, Term Sheet, First Round Review and Founder Hacks.\" Book on your nightstand (or e-reader) \"These days, I mostly read non-fiction books - many of them related to growing our user base and building products. Recent books I've read include Traction by Gabriel Weinberg, Play Bigger by Al Ramadan, Pre-suasion by Robert Cialdini and Payoff by Dan Ariely. The last non-business book I read was \"When Breath Becomes Air\", which is a very moving real story of the life of Dr. Paul Kalanithi who chronicles his journey as a doctor and his battles with cancer.\" Night owl or early riser? What are your sleep patterns? \"I am definitely a night owl. I try to sleep by 12:30 a.m., and I get up around 6:30 a.m.\" Where do you get your best ideas? \"I get my best ideas when I've been thinking about the problem for several days, usually when I get up in the morning having thought about solutions to the problem the previous night.\" ",

(Entomo Photo)\n When you think \"enterprise software,\" industry leaders like Oracle, Microsoft and SAP may come to mind, but Entomo may not be on that list. The Bellevue, Wash.-based startup wants to change that. Entomo has raised about $2.5 million of a $3.5 million round, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company confirmed the investment to GeekWire and said it plans to beef up sales and marketing and get its product in front of more businesses. Entomo is not disclosing the names of investors in this round. The startup offers channel revenue management software for business-to-business clients. In other words, Entomo's products help customers maximize the money they bring in throughout the complex process of selling items to other businesses. \"We remove the friction all the way from opportunity to cash,\" said Entomo CEO Sanjoy Chatterji. \"Along that lifecycle, from finding an opportunity to doing a quote; to turning it into an auditor; to shipping the product; eventually collecting cash; paying rebates, there are lots of points of friction as well as lots of points of where margin and revenue can be lost.\" Chatterji founded Entomo in 1999. Before going into enterprise software, he was Founder and President of Trinetra Consulting Group, an organization that helped early-stage startups scale. Entomo sells subscriptions to its software to customers like Brother, Targus, DishTV, and others. Chatterji believes the startup has the potential to take on big competitors if it can get the word out effectively. \"How did Microsoft compete with IBM when they started?\" he said. \"How did Oracle compete with IBM when they started? We have a better product. We're more nimble. The time to value is much shorter. We can implement in three to four months compared to their implementations may take 12 to 24 months. But what they have, and what we don't have, is really name recognition and that's why we're raising the funds.\" ",

(Mpirica Photo)\n One of the first things we do when deciding where to buy a house or what company to work for is look at independent rankings. But we rarely do that when making health decisions, like where we have surgery or deliver a baby. Mpirica Health thinks those decisions should be more data-based, and it's building a platform fueled by artificial intelligence that ranks hospitals based on actual health outcomes. The Seattle area startup just closed a $4.6 million Series A round led by equity crowdfunding service OurCrowd, bringing the company's total funding to $6.6 million. The funds will help the startup roll out its service on a national scale and continue to develop its platform. \"Our vision is that in the future no one would ever consider booking a surgery without first knowing the MPIRICA Quality Score of their hospital or surgeon,\" Mpirica co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer Chris Diede told GeekWire in an email interview. \"We've heard our score referred to as a 'FICO Score for Surgery' before, or perhaps better, the 'batting average' of a provider's demonstrated performance at a given procedure.\" The company's ranking system is based on work by Dr. Michael Pine, a cardiologist and founder of MPA Healthcare Solutions. He has been developing transparent evaluation and ranking systems for hospitals for over 30 years, something that has historically been lacking in the field. Pine sits on Mpirica's board and MPA is also an investor in the company. Mpirica's platform combines Pine's system with health insurance claims data gathered from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to come up with rankings for hospitals. The rankings are broken out by different procedures -- like knee replacements or C-sections -- and region. Check out this graphic to see how all the data comes together. Access to the rankings costs $49 for individuals, for three months of access to data on one procedure in one region. Companies and health plans can also buy a premium subscription for their customers or employees, and Diede said Mpirica is working on more B2B partnerships. Mpirica -- whose name is a play on \"empirical,\" describing an evidence-based approach -- was founded in 2014 by Diede, current Mpirica CEO and former Microsoft manager Shakil Haroon and current VP of Business Development Bob Piper. The company employs 12 full- and part-time employees at its headquarters in the Bellevue, Wash., coworking space WeWork Lincoln Square. ",

The Seattle startup is rolling out its first national ad campaign today to promote its dog walking and sitting marketplace.  Rover says it's now the largest dog care network in the country with more than 100,000 sitters and 75,000 dog walkers. Rover beefed up its network by acquiring its top competitor, DogVacay, for an undisclosed sum in March.  Thanks to that growth, Rover is planning to spend $4.5 million on marketing and advertisement this year. The national campaign launching today is Rover's biggest media investment to date. By offering services in cities across the U.S. and Canada, Rover and DogVacay generated over $150 million in bookings in 2016. Last year, Rover raised $40 million in what CEO Aaron Easterly said could be its last round of fundraising before going public. \"Our goal with this campaign is to show pet parents that Rover can help them find true dog people who will care for their dog the same way they would ...

(GeekWire Photo / Monica Nickelsburg)\n Before even graduating from the Techstars Seattle 2017 class, Stackery CEO Nate Taggart had a check in hand -- and not just the $120,000 that startups get when they join the accelerator. Stackery raised a $1.75 million round on top of the Techstars cash, bringing the startup's total funding to $1.87 million to date. Voyager Capital led the round, with participation from Pipeline Capital, Founder's Co-op, and Arnold Venture Group. Stackery, which makes tools to help developers build applications in the cloud without needing to directly provision servers, will use the cash to expand its product team. Taggart sees serverless development as the next big shift in computing and he wants to be on the cutting edge of it. Stackery allows developers to drag-and-drop nodes that represent databases, code functions, and other components of their application infrastructure and then deploy and monitor their apps without a server. Stackery integrates with Amazon Web Services and plans to add Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud soon. \"Simply put, we make serverless work,\" Taggart said. \"Most of the competition in our space are code frameworks. They're essentially a template for writing code, which helps organize and deploy the application. Stackery is a software tool, not a framework, and in addition to organizing and deploying code, we're really focused on connecting the underlying infrastructure and maintaining application health, particularly for large-scale applications.\" Stackery's unique approach to serverless development caught the attention of Voyager Capital Partner Diane Fraiman. \"On Feb. 10, Nate Taggart was in my office in Portland and he presented the best 30-minute, no-deck pitch that I had seen in 10 years,\" she said on stage at Demo Night. \"What Nate basically told me was that he and his co-founder, Chase Douglas, were going to build Stackery to disrupt the DevOps cloud infrastructure market with a serverless toolset ...

      "content": "Redfin CTO Bridget Frey delivered the keynote before a class of male CEOs pitched during Techstars Seattle Demo Night. (GeekWire Photo / Monica Nickelsburg)\n It's no secret that tech has a diversity problem. In fact, the lack of gender equity at tech events has become so quotidian that I almost didn't notice that each of the nine CEOs pitching on stage at last night's Techstars Seattle demo event were men. Gender inequity is a pervasive problem in the startup world. Just 17 percent of venture-backed companies in the first quarter of 2017 had at least one female founder, according to a recent study. The same was true for all of 2016 and the number has stagnated since 2012. Redfin CTO Bridget Frey addressed the issue head-on, as the keynote speaker at Techstars Seattle Demo Night. \"It's a really hard problem,\" she said. \"It takes a lot of effort and it's something that's hard to work on when you're at the beginning of starting a company; when you are thinking about getting your first prototype out the door; when you're thinking about getting funding. How do you make time to also think about building a diverse team?\" Although it was encouraging to hear from a woman who has broken down gender barriers and excelled in her field, as the rest of the program showed, she's still very much a minority. It's an issue that GeekWire struggles with too, as we seek out a diverse range of industry leaders to speak our events. But it's important not to let the ubiquity of the problem translate into complacency. Chris DeVore, managing director of Techstars Seattle, is well aware of how much work there is to be done. It was the impetus for a blog post, titled \"Failing, Frustrated + Asking for Help,\" that he wrote when this year's Techstars Seattle class was selected. \"My commitment to working with founders from underrepresented groups isn't just a way for me to feel good about myself or earn PR points for Techstars,\" he wrote. \"It's a deliberate strategy to back the most ferocious and relentless founders I can find, the ones who will walk through walls to deliver for their teams, their investors and themselves. I am failing in this work. And I'm asking for your help.\" DeVore ensured that members of the Seattle Female Founder's Alliance (SFFA) were seated up front during the event. Leslie Feinzaig, the group's founder and a Techstars Seattle mentor, wants to help the accelerator become more diverse. \"It is a problem that is bigger and broader than Techstars, and I don't believe there is a single solution nor a short-term one,\" she said. \"The SFFA is proving that the pipeline of female founders is a lot bigger than we thought -- we have 70 members today, an additional 30 applicants in due diligence, and new founders popping up every day -- and that's in less than two months. So, I think the next steps for us are to help female founders with applicant readiness, and partner with Techstars and other accelerators who are trying to create a truly inclusive environment.\" In 2015, the national Techstars umbrella announced a series of diversity goals, including doubling the number of women in the applicant pool and mentor network, publishing diversity data, and training staff on \"unconscious bias.\" The organization also created The Techstars Foundation, a non-profit that promotes diversity in the startup world through grants, scholarships, and sponsorships. But as DeVore noted in his blog post, Techstars Seattle is falling short of those goals. Here's what he says happened with the 2017 class: DeVore is asking members of the community to send him feedback on how Techstars Seattle can improve diversity, not just in the application pipeline but in the final class of startups that go through the program. Techstars Seattle plans to take that feedback and translate it into changes to the program later this year. \"Einstein famously said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results,\" DeVore says. \"I'm committed to achieving different results in our diversity recruiting, so I need to start doing some different things.\" ",

(Boundless Photo)\n Boundless, a Seattle startup that aims to help people navigate the U.S. immigration process, has come out of stealth mode and announced $3.5 million in seed financing. The round was led by Trilogy Equity Partners, and Foundry Group, Founders' Co-op, Two Sigma Ventures and a group of strategic angel investors also participated. Boundless, a spinout of Seattle-based startup studio Pioneer Square Labs, will use the cash infusion to build and launch its first products, grow its engineering team and foster partnerships. Boundless' co-founders boast major tech credentials and five of the company's six staffers went through the immigration process themselves. In February, Boundless CEO Xiao Wang left his job as a senior product manager at Amazon, where he helped build and launch Amazon Go, the Seattle retailer's ambitious new convenience store operation to co-found and run Boundless. Wang came to the U.S. from Nanjing, China at three and went on to earn advanced degrees from Stanford and Harvard Business School before jumping into leadership roles in tech. He co-founded Boundless to ensure immigrants, like himself, have access to the same opportunities he had. Boundless' co-founders include President Doug Rand, who was assistant director for entrepreneurship in the Obama White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Chief Technology Officer Serdar Sutay. Sutay is an immigrant from Turkey, and he has led engineering teams at Chef and Microsoft. Boundless is working on its first product, which is focused on family immigration issues. It will emphasize helping U.S. citizens and Green Card holders apply for visas for their spouses. Prior to launching its first product, Boundless is looking to work with individuals and families in the Seattle area going through the spousal visa process. \"The immigration process is opaque, intimidating, and high-stakes,\" Wang said. \"As an immigrant, I know how frustrating the waiting process can be, particularly when your family's future is on the line. I am dedicated to giving everyone the information and tools they need to confidently and successfully navigate the legal immigration process.\" Boundless comes as President Donald Trump's immigration policies, including stalled travel bans from some majority Muslim countries, and possible changes to the H1-B work visa program, are sending shockwaves of anxiety through the tech community, which relies on a diverse talent pool. Boundless is Pioneer Square Labs' fourth spinout. PSL previously spun out sales tax reporting startup LumaTax, an advertisement monitoring company called Ad Lightning, and JetClosing, which digitally streamlines the real estate purchasing process.

Continue for our favorites pitches, photos from Demo Night, and read more about each team in recent installments of our Startup Spotlight series. Hazel CEO Wisam Abdulla delivered his pitch with the confidence of an entrepreneur who believes in his product 100 percent. His enthusiasm, combined with a clearly identified problem, explanation of how his startup is solving it, and demonstration of early traction made Hazel's pitch one of the strongest in the bunch. Hazel makes enterprise software that helps companies get a bird's eye view on how well its managers are performing and provides ongoing feedback and training resources to help leaders improve. \"We've designed a new and truly effective way for companies to develop and enable their managers,\" Abdulla said. Hazel polls employees via Slack and other messaging tools to find out a manager's strengths and weakness. The service then provides resources to help leaders improve over time and encourages strong managers to become mentors for others who need help. The service costs $50 to $100 per manager, per month. Abdulla and his co-founders came up with the idea for Hazel when they were building Canadian payroll startup Rise. Their customers constantly complained about how hard it was to train great managers. Abdulla experienced this struggle firsthand, in his first leadership role. When a top player on his team departed, he was left wondering what he could've done differently as a manager. \"We help companies develop and enable their managers in a personalized ongoing and engaging way so that no one ever has to manage like I did in my first year,\" Abdulla said during his pitch. It's no easy feat pitching something as esoteric as \"solutions to build production-grade serverless applications\" to a crowd that's not exclusively software engineers. But it was clear from Stackery CEO Nate Taggert's conviction and a ringing endorsement from Voyager Capital's Diane Fraiman, that the startup is building something powerful. Stackery provides tools to help developers make apps that operate with the same level of efficiency and security as legacy applications, without relying on a server. \"We're at the beginning of a major revolution in infrastructure technology,\" Taggart said. \"Serverless is transforming the way modern applications are built and delivered in the same ways that cloud disrupted the physical hardware market. We have an exceptional team and we know this space.\" Taggart and Stackery co-founder Chase Douglas started working together in 2013 when they joined forces to build the New Relic Browser. Before that, Taggart was a product manager at GitHub and Douglas was an engineer for IBM. \"We know how to get our product in front of developers,\" Taggart said. Swym CEO Arvind Krishnan impressed the crowd Wednesday with the amount of early traction his company is enjoying. The startup, which helps small and medium e-commerce companies track shoppers across devices, is seeing 30 percent month-over-month growth, adding 100 stores every week, according to Krishnan. All of those sellers are coming to Swym through Shopify and the startup plans to integrate with additional e-commerce platforms soon. Krishnan says Swym is on track to hit 10 million users in the next year. \"This is just the beginning for us,\" he said. \"The real opportunity that we're going after, the mid-to-large retailers, collectively did over $120 billion in sales last year. And these stores are running their e-commerce sites on a handful of platforms.\" Swym allows retailers to re-connect with customers who have started a shopping session on one device and picked back up on another -- even if they haven't logged in. The software detects patterns between devices and users, creating a user profile with information on their social media profiles and shopping preferences. Krishnan brings with him experience working in product management for Microsoft and Yahoo. \"Swym is changing the way consumer shop on mobile,\" he said. ",

      "content": "The percentage of venture-backed startups with at least one female founder has plateaued at 17 percent for the past five years. (Crunchbase Graphic)\n There have been increasing efforts over the past few years to close the gender gap in tech, and particularly in startups. A high-profile scandal inside Uber's engineering division, and constant efforts from women in business and tech positions, have made diversity front-and-center in the minds of many. So how much have the headlines, the hours spent networking and the push for diversity in hiring changed the landscape for women at the heads of startups? Not much, it turns out. A new report from Crunchbase's ongoing study of female founders found that just 17 percent of venture-backed companies in the first quarter of 2017 had at least one female founder. The same was true for all of 2016. In fact, that number has held steady since 2012 -- apart from in 2015, where it was just 16 percent. The report also found that women-led startups receive fewer investment dollars than male-led startups at every stage of the funding process. The gap is particularly large in late-stage funding, where startups with at least one female founder raised just 8 percent of rounds and 7 percent of total dollars. The lack of movement in the founder gender gap over the past five years tells us something many women already knew: There's no silver bullet to solve diversity challenges. Many of the factors that influence gender gaps in startups, and more generally in tech industry leadership, have to do with deeply ingrained social and cultural norms. Unfortunately, there's very little research to help companies, investors and founders address the problem. A recent study from TinyPulse also indicates startup leaders have a blind spot when it comes to culture: the study found that leaders consistently rated their company's culture better than their employees did. The same study found that startups with female founders tended to grow faster, possibly because more diverse workforces are consistently found to lead to better results. ",

Now the company is taking it up a notch with the help of machine learning. The Seattle startup today rolled out a new revenue planning product that uses machine learning to crunch historical data and better predict specific \"what if\" scenarios -- like increasing marketing spend for outbound calling, or reducing event sponsorship budgets, for example. Bizible CEO Aaron Bird called it the biggest product launch since his company started in 2012. \"We've been solving this problem indirectly since we launched, but now we've got to the point where we have a really good view of causality for marketing activities,\" Bird told GeekWire. \"The next level for us is to use all of that rich data we have about causality, layer on machine learning, and use that to predict the future around what is going to happen with your marketing efforts.\" Here's an example of what the new product looks like to a user (click to enlarge):  Bird explained that most B2B marketing teams try to forecast by taking averages of conversation rates, velocity, deal size, and other factors. But this isn't the most effective way of planning for the future, he said. Bizible's machine learning algorithms help provide a projected revenue for every contact, lead, and opportunity based on each piece of historical data measured at a granular level. \"If you don't have a good understanding of causality in the past, then you can't do a good job of planning the future,\" he noted. Bird added that the new product is particularly valuable for B2B marketers who deal with longer sales cycles and need to forecast for several months out to the future. Bird, a former Microsoft program manager, started Bizible in 2011 and took it through Techstars in 2012. The company, which has raised $10.5 million to date, now counts more than 280 customers and expects its revenue to double this year. Bizible also just moved into a new office in Seattle where it employs 65 people -- that's up 50 percent from January -- and hiring will continue throughout 2017. ",

      "content": "After a rocky end to 2016, Seattle-based insurance comparison startup QuoteWizard is back in the game. The privately held company today announced the launch of a new car insurance tool, CarrierCompare, and told GeekWire that March of 2017 was its most profitable month yet. QuoteWizard was growing quickly last year, approaching $100 million in revenue and opening a new office in Denver. But in November, it announced 50 layoffs, about 30 percent of its workforce at the time. QuoteWizard CEO Scott Peyree told GeekWire the layoffs were due to constrained spending by the insurance industry, where the company makes its money, and that the company was looking for more sustainable business solutions. Now QuoteWizard says it is projecting revenues of $75 million to $80 million for the year, and it posted a net profit of over $1 million in March. It's also hiring again for some positions. Peyree said the turnaround was both because of an upturn in insurance spending and because the company has started to see payoffs from tech and strategy investments. The 100-person company is now in the running for the Bootstrapper of the Year award at this year's GeekWire Awards, taking place May 4th at Seattle's MoPOP. \"The psychological impact of running a company where it is not only your own blood and sweat, but also all of your (and your partners) own money provides a focus and desire to succeed that you don't get when taking outside investment,\" Peyree told GeekWire earlier this week. The new CarrierCompare tool allows users to directly compare car insurance plans from 30 insurance providers, giving objective assessments on elements like consumer satisfaction and financial strength. \"We developed CarrierCompare to be much more than just a company database,\" QuoteWizard Content Manager Adam Johnson said in a press release. \"When users access a company page on CarrierCompare, they also have the option to directly compare it alongside another insurance company. This allows consumers to easily evaluate the policy options, potential discounts, strengths, weaknesses, and more, all free of charge.\" The bootstrapped startup has been family owned since its founding in 2006 and, for a time, was one of the fastest growing companies in Washington state.

Photo via Lumen Learning.\n Portland-based Lumen Learning today announced a $3.75 million Series A investment round and a new partnership with Follett to expand the distribution of its open digital education course materials. Follett, which manages course materials delivery for more than 1,200 college and universities, participated in the Series A round, as did previous investors Portland Seed Fund and Seattle-based Alliance of Angels. Total funding for the 5-year-old company is $6.3 million to date. Founded in 2012 by Kim Thanos and David Wiley, Lumen Learning helps students at more than 100 institutions save on traditional textbook costs by offering open education resources (OER) for popular college courses. OER are available under public domain or have been released under a copyright license and include full courses, course materials, videos, tests, and more. Now Lumen Learning's courseware will be available to students attending schools that work with Follett to distribute course material. Students pay a Lumen support fee of $10-$25 via the campus bookstore to access the customizable courseware, which can be integrated into a school's existing learning management system. Lumen Learning takes advantage of the millions of dollars that government, foundations, and other educational organizations have invested in OER and designs its own low-cost learning materials. \"Working in the higher education market, our secret sauce is being a mission-driven organization filled with people -- many of them from the academic world -- who are passionate about improving learning and offering affordable access to education for all students,\" Lumen Learning CEO Kim Thanos told GeekWire. \"This means we're committed to developing products that actually improve learning, and that work effectively in real classrooms filled with students and teachers struggling with real-world problems: lack of time, tight funding, competing priorities, under-preparation for the college environment, and so forth.\" Lumen Learning was previously a grantee in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Next Generation Learning Challenge and Next Generation Courseware Challenge programs.

      "content": "Swym CEO Arvind Krishnan. (Swym Photo)\n It's not an easy time to be in the e-commerce business. Tech titans, like Amazon and Walmart, are able to devote far more resources to their digital products than smaller companies have at their disposal. That's where Swym comes in. The Seattle startup has a platform that allows online retailers to provide features similar to Amazon's shopping history or Expedia's \"Scratchpad\" tool. Using Swym, retailers can track shoppers behavior across multiple devices, allowing them to follow-up with customers the next time they visit the website. If for example, a shopper adds an item to her cart while browsing on mobile, the retailer can remind her next time she visits the site on her laptop. Swym's technology works even if the shopper hasn't logged into an account. Watch the video below for an overview of how the product works.  \"Consumer shopping journeys are becoming increasingly multi-device, and their expectations for what makes for a good shopping experience are constantly evolving,\" said Swym CEO Arvind Krishnan. \"It's becoming clear that brands that don't put digital convenience at the forefront will not stand much of a chance in the new landscape.\" Swym is a product of the TiE Silicon Valley incubator. The startup is a current member of the Techstars Seattle 2017 class. We caught up with Krishnan for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"Smartphones are changing the way we shop in very fundamental ways. Swym helps e-commerce brands engage better with their mobile shoppers by accurately mapping a shopper's journey across devices, and using that context to deliver a truly personalized experience for them.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"We were frustrated by the mobile shopping experience offered by most retailers - it seemed pretty ordinary and hardly personal. Meanwhile, services like Netflix, Spotify, and Flipboard were delivering a 'wow' experience by making it all about the user, and what the user cares about. When we first encountered the Expedia Scratchpad, we thought all e-commerce sites should have that assistance capability and our vision started to come together for how we bridge those two worlds of e-commerce and personalized assistance.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"It's been an interesting journey -- we were incubated at TiE Launchpad in Silicon Valley, raised some angel money subsequently, and are now part of Techstars Seattle. After a few failed experiments around the right path to scale, we've seen some incredible growth in the last eight months and are very excited about the road ahead.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Being able to map the shopper journey across devices and leveraging that to deliver a personalized experience for them.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"While the opportunity we are going after is broad and complex, it was important to focus initially on a specific segment and prove out our hypothesis. We made a bold call a few months ago to focus solely on the Shopify platform as our first stop, and that has worked out really well for us.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Trying to build a self-serve offering initially for a market segment that wasn't quite ready for self-serve. A few initial false positives sent us down the wrong path early on, but thankfully we course corrected before it was too late.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"With a fair bit of Microsoft DNA in the team, there is always an inherent Gates bias, but we also feel his influence is already a part of who we are. And given our vertical and the focus on the customer experience, we'd hugely value having Jeff in our corner. Amazon's been absolutely amazing at demonstrating how relentless customer focus can be a massively successful strategy, and we definitely look to them for inspiration in more ways than one.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"We love our weekend 'hackathons' - every couple of months, we vote on a fun feature/module we want to build together, camp out at some remote, exotic location to build it, and don't get out until we are done. It'll be more challenging to keep this going as the team grows, but it's done wonders for team chemistry.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Three things actually - passion for making a big impact, a relentless focus on getting things done, and a strong culture fit with the team.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"You are going to hear \"no,\" a lot. Don't let that faze you - you are on this path for a reason. Back yourself 100 percent, keep making forward progress, and the tide will eventually turn in your favor.

      "content": "(TurboPatent Photo)\n Seattle startup TurboPatent has raised $1.45 million in a convertible note as it gets ready to release the second version of some products and expand its documentation automation capabilities. TurboPatent focuses on corporations and law firms of all sizes, automating tasks like formatting or document preparation, for example, freeing up people to work on more complex, high-value work. The service is designed to cut costs, save time and lead to more accurate patent documentation. The 25-person company said it has the same impact on the patent industry as CAD (computer-aided drafting) did for engineering, the cloud for IT infrastructure, and robotics for manufacturing. The latest funding comes from existing institutional, strategic, and founder investors as well as new private investors. The company raised its first outside funding in 2015, a $2 million seed round led by Voyager Capital. TurboPatent recently released a new automation product, SmartShell, that helps paralegals speed up responding to office actions and reduces human error. Formerly known as Patent Navigation, TurboPatent boasts an experienced team led by co-founders James Billmaier and Charles Mirho. Billmaier was previously CEO of Melodeo, a cloud-based media platform company that sold to HP in 2010. He also teamed up with Paul Allen in 1999 to launch home-entertainment technology company Digeo, which was eventually sold in 2009 to ARRIS Group Inc. Mirho, meanwhile, is a patent law veteran, having worked as a patent counsel at Intel and later as a managing partner of a patent law firm. He also has a computer science degree from Rutgers. ",

      "content": "(Bigstock)\n New Seattle startup Fashwire is taking a new approach to software for the fashion industry. \"Most fashion apps are consumer solutions masquerading as a designer solution,\" Fashwire founder Kimberly Carney tells GeekWire. \"We are a platform just for the designer.\" Fashwire just closed a $725,000 seed round from private angel investors in Seattle, New York and Los Angeles. The cash will be used to help the startup grow its app that provides a direct, interactive link between designers and consumers. Carney, who owns an independent clothing boutique that gives her a direct connection to designers, said the company will also use the funds to bring on new and established designers to Fashwire's platform. The company previously attempted a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter but canceled it to accept outside investments. Here's how the app works. Designers post pictures of new pieces to Fashwire and the app's users rate the piece, giving it a simple thumbs up or thumbs down. That feedback is returned to the designer in real-time, allowing them to tap into consumer trends as they are designing. On the flip side, consumers get a window into the design world, and as extra motivation, they can earn points and rewards for giving feedback. Here's a video from Fashwire that demos the app:  The company joins an increasingly crowded field, with Seattle-based startups like Glamhive, Garmentory and Fitcode also taking a tech-focused angle on the fashion market. Big names like Nordstrom and Amazon are also looking for ways to innovate in the fashion world. Carney said Fashwire is now raising its Series A round and preparingfor a beta test ahead of its wider launch in August. So far it has 6,000 users and 1,400 designers signed up to be in the beta. Fashwire plans to make money by charging fashion designers a subscription fee; other revenue engines include advertising, sponsorships and product offerings. \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Migo CEO Jeff Warren.\n A decade ago, if you were trying to get around in a city without a personal vehicle, there were a few options. You could utilize public transportation like a bus or subway; hail a taxi from the street; walk; bike; or have a friend drive you around. Fast forward to 2017, and technology has changed the game. Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft are prevalent in nearly every large U.S. city while car-sharing services like Car2go and BMW ReachNow are quickly gaining popularity. Consumers now have access to a bevy of transportation choices, all powered by your smartphone. But how do you know which is the cheapest, or which option will get you to your destination the fastest? Does it make sense to use car-sharing if surge pricing for apps like Uber and Lyft is in effect? What's the best option in your vicinity? And what services are even available in the city you're in? This is the problem Migo wants to solve. The Seattle startup continues to build out its app that acts as a real-time search engine for on-demand transportation. GeekWire wrote about Migo's $1.5 million investment round in February, but CEO and founder Jeff Warren talked more about the company's vision and technology in a recent interview. The app, which is still in beta mode with users in Seattle -- you can sign up for the beta here -- aggregates different transportation options, with real-time data on price estimates and wait time. It lets users hail and pay for a ride all from within the Migo app. Warren is a veteran of Expedia, where he led groups working on mobile products, regional marketing, and more. He also spent time with the travel giant's metasearch team, which built software that helped Expedia drive transactions and expand its brand across the world. Companies like Kayak, Trivago, and TripAdvisor have built entire businesses around the idea of metasearch. Warren's team at Migo, which includes former Expedia colleagues, is \"tuned toward understanding consumer search patterns,\" he noted. \"There are lots of parallels in personal transportation,\" Warren said. But Warren doesn't describe Migo as a \"Kayak for on-demand transportation\" and strays away from calling it a pure aggregator. He likens it more to a \"Netflix for personal transportation.\" \"It's all about discovery,\" he explained. \"You'll go on Netflix and watch your favorite show, but then it will get to know you and allow you to discover things you wouldn't otherwise. That's how we think about Migo -- it's definitely aggregation, but it's also just as much about discovery.\" Warren said the lightbulb went off when he started looking at transportation trends in cities. He said there are now 9-to-15 e-hailing options, on average, in cities across the U.S. and Canada, with many sprouting up in the past year or so. Urbanization trends suggest that usage of these services will only increase over the next decade, with fewer people relying on personal vehicles. \"What has evolved is a really rich ecosystem of personal transportation options in all these cities,\" Warren noted. Having so many more choices is good for consumers, but Warren realized that they often times aren't aware of all the options available, and even if they do, people don't typically like switching between 10 different apps. Also, based on the company's research, the \"best\" service for a specific user changes throughout the day and depends on time, location, and overall usage by other customers. That's why Migo's mission is about discovery. \"There are a lot of options,\" Warren said. \"It's just hard for people to know it.\" Migo hooks into APIs from apps like Lyft to funnel available options into its own app, allowing the user to search, book, and pay for a ride all within Migo. For apps that do not have APIs, Migo has developed its own virtualization platform that lets it re-represent external app data into Migo itself. Services like Lyft, Car2go, and Seattle Yellow Cab are on the app, but one particular service -- Uber -- is not. Warren said that in order to get all providers on Migo, and particularly the dominant ones, \"you have to have a value proposition for them: new customers or incremental business.\" \"Over time, just like we saw with Expedia, everyone will join, but we have to be at scale where we're interesting to everybody,\" he added. Migo makes money by charging a per-hail fee and a customer creation fee. Warren said that his team has discussed incorporating public transit data into its app, but for now it is focused on on-demand transportation providers. \"I don't think we can realistically take on the fragmented market of personal transportation and public transportation simultaneously,\" he said. There are several other competing services in this space: Ride Guru and Ride Fair, to name a few. Another one, RideScout, launched in 2013, called itself the \"Kayak of transportation,\" and was acquired by Daimler AG last year. But Warren thinks Migo's timing -- there are more mobility options than ever -- is the differentiator. \"The biggest and most fundamental difference is the ecosystem,\" he said.  Migo has raised $2 million to date and employ 5-to-10 people. ",

      "content": "Pluto VR lets you talk to other people within virtual reality apps. (Pluto VR Photo)\n Pluto VR, the Seattle-based virtual reality startup co-founded by PopCap Games co-founder John Vechey, has raised $13.9 million in a Series A funding round. The company, which is developing applications for people to communicate within virtual reality, will use the cash infusion to continue research and development, roll out its alpha test to more customers and support additional platforms. Seattle-based Maveron led the round, with participation from Madrona Venture Group of Seattle, Trilogy Equity Partners of Bellevue and other individual investors. Maveron co-founder and General Partner, Dan Levitan, will join Pluto's board of directors. Maveron, founded by Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz and Levitan in 1998, has already backed three VR startups -- Virtuix, an active VR motion gaming platform; VicariousVR, a connected VR social network; and Against Gravity, a Seattle-based startup behind the hit VR game \"Rec Room.\" Anarghya Vardhana, a senior associate at Maveron, explained to GeekWire in February why the firm is so bullish about VR/AR. \"We see this as a way in which people interact with the world around them; with each other; with entertainment; with work,\" she told GeekWire. \"It's going to be a big computing shift, just like we saw a computing shift with the personal computer and cell phone.\" Pluto VR wants to be the application we use to talk to other people who are also wearing a virtual or augmented reality headset. The three-year-old Seattle startup is developing something like Skype or Facebook Messenger -- a communication app that can run on its own, or on top of other experiences -- but for virtual reality. \"The purpose of Pluto is to help humanity transcend physical location,\" Vechey said in a statement. \"While digital technologies today allow us to connect instantly from anywhere in the world with text, voice or video, they aren't necessarily bringing us closer together. With Pluto, you'll be able to connect with anyone anywhere, as if you were together in person.\" GeekWire visited Pluto's Seattle headquarters late last year and checked out its VR communication system. Pluto was a Seattle 10 company in 2015, and it employs 17 people at its Ballard office, which was previously occupied by pet insurance company Trupanion. It's much too large of a building for your typical 17-person startup, but it's perfect for Pluto given the technology it is building. The extra space and individual offices allow the company to better test its software. From its own app control panel, Pluto lets you create your own avatar, control the opacity of each person, mute mics or make \"calls\" to other people without needing an avatar, and more. For now, Pluto only uses avatars that show faces and hand movements -- which are trackable with headsets and accompanying controllers. Vechey said the company has no immediate plans to release its product more broadly, and that Pluto VR is focused on getting the little things right with alpha customers and rolling out slowly. ",

(From left: Raj Advani, Danny Moon, Robin Har, and Vik Advani. Viro Media Photo)\n Danny Moon believes we're on the cusp of a virtual reality revolution that's held back by a lack of content. Getting more VR experiences on the market was the impetus for the Viro Media, a startup he co-founded with longtime partners Raj and Vik Advani and Robin Har in 2015. Their goal is \"democratizing VR development,\" Moon said. Viro just closed a $2.5 million funding round to bring on more developers and accelerate that vision. The cash will go toward building out Viro's framework, which enables developers to create virtual reality apps and experiences using programming tools they already know. \"Our stack is our own 3D render engine combined with React Native so it's a familiar open-source framework from Facebook that lots of web and mobile developers are familiar with,\" Moon said. \"Now they can leverage their skills to start building for VR.\" The round was led by Lowercase Capital, SoftBank NYC, and Eniac Ventures with participation from Presence Capital, Box Group, Betaworks, Rugged Ventures. Prior to Viro, the company's four co-founders launched and built UpNext, a 3D mapping startup that sold to Amazon in 2012. The team stayed on at Amazon for a few years, helping to incorporate the technology into Kindle tablets and the now-defunct Fire Phone. \"We have always been very interested in 3D visualization technologies and when we saw VR, we immediately knew this is where we wanted to go,\" Moon said. \"We started building apps on some of the game engines and while we believe they're great tools, they didn't service the need we were looking for. We wanted to build more content-focused, dynamic and interactive applications. So rather than build the app we decided to build the framework.\" Viro's seven-person team is headquartered at the WeWork Westlake co-working space in Seattle.

      "content": "The core Nextio team: Andy Nelson; co-founders Anoop Gupta (CEO) and Aravind Bala (CTO); Vikas Manocha; John Tippett; and Bentham Chang. (Nextio Photo)\n A new professional messaging service called Nextio aims to challenge a key feature of LinkedIn by turning the economic model on its head -- giving the recipients of messages most of the money paid by marketers, recruiters and others seeking to reach them. The Bellevue, Wash.-based company, formerly known as Telo, was co-founded by CEO Anoop Gupta, a former technical assistant to Bill Gates who previously led Microsoft's Unified Communications Group; and CTO Aravind Bala, a former Microsoft partner engineering manager who worked on products including Bing and Office. Nextio is launching today. Here's how the messaging feature works. Gupta and Bala say the idea is to align the interests of senders and recipients to deliver better value to both sides, making promotional messages more relevant and effective, and compensating the recipients of those messages for their time and attention. The suggested price per message ranges from 10 AUs ($1) to 100 AUs ($10), although recipients can also enter a custom amount. Nextio's approach is based on the concept that attention is the new currency, Gupta says. \"This is not a way people are going to get rich,\" said Gupta, putting the numbers in perspective. \"Many people will feel more comfortable donating to charities, but if the younger kids want beer money, that's good, too.\" However, this is a big market. Marketers, recruiters and others pay hefty premiums to get their messages out. Messaging is a core feature of LinkedIn's premium plans. Microsoft paid more than $26 billion to acquire the business social network last year. Facebook, which made more than $27 billion in revenue last year, charges brands to elevate their posts to reach more users. \"There's big money spent in getting to you,\" Bala said. The money will be spent somewhere. It can be spent on the middleman or it can be spent on you.\" Another big difference from LinkedIn: Everyone on Nextio is visible to others, eliminating the need to pay a premium for additional visibility into the people beyond your social circle. The service is free to end users. To help build a critical mass of users, Nextio also offers a feature called Career Insights, which uses natural language processing and machine learning to analyze a database of millions of public profiles -- showing users how people in similar positions have advanced their careers. It's designed to give people unique insights into the education, skills and experience they need to get ahead. In some ways, Gupta and Bala are competing against their former company with their startup, with LinkedIn now part of Microsoft. For end users, Nextio is not a replacement for LinkedIn's broader set of features, but the concept does pose a potential threat to its business model. Gupta and Bala both left Microsoft in November 2015 and came up with the Nextio idea in early 2016. Microsoft announced its agreement to acquire LinkedIn in June 2016. Nextio, then known as Telo, raised $2.2 million in funding in November 2016 from investors in Seattle and Silicon Valley. Nextio has a core team of six people, in addition to contractors. ",

(GeekWire Photo)\n From eSports to VR and robotics to home-sharing, our Young Entrepreneur of the Year finalists are on a mission to find big opportunities using the latest technology. We have five impressive young geeks competing in this category in our annual GeekWire Awards, the Oscars of the Northwest tech community. Our Young Entrepreneur of the Year finalists are Nick Fajt, co-founder and CEO of Against Gravity; Grant Farwell, CEO of Matcherino; Ben Gilbert, co-founder of Pioneer Square Labs; Garett Ochs, co-founder and CEO of Otto Robotics; and Yifan Zhang and Adam Stelle, co-founders of Loftium. Read more about each of them and vote for your pick in the poll below. And big thanks to Deloitte for sponsoring our Young Entrepreneur of the Year award. We've opened voting in several GeekWire Awards categories and we'll continue to do so over the next 10 days, with GeekWire readers choosing their top picks. Check back on GeekWire each day to cast your ballots, and go here to vote in previously announced categories. All of the winners will be revealed at the GeekWire Awards -- presented by Wave Business -- on May 4 at the Museum of Pop Culture. Tickets are selling fast, and we do expect to sell out, so make sure to go here to grab yours.  Nick Fajt is the CEO and Co-founder of Against Gravity, a \"VR social club\" that connects people around the world to play virtual reality games. He's a firm believer that VR is next computing platform. He calls it an \"internet-sized opportunity.\" Investors seem to believe in his vision too. Against Gravity recently raised $5 million from Sequoia, First Round, Acequia, Vulcan, Maveron, and others. Fajt cut his teeth in VR for five years at Microsoft where he was an executive producer and principal program manager on HoloLens. He holds a Bachelor's degree in computer science from Cornell University. Grant Farwell has watched eSports take off in the past few years and he saw a big opportunity in this new market. The result was Matcherino, a platform that allows eSports fans to raise money to see their favorite gamers duel or pay to compete against the pros. Shortly after graduating from Techstars Seattle, Matcherino raised a $1.25 million seed round led by Madrona Venture Group. \"When many, many thousands of fans want to see certain professionals battle against each other and are willing to chip in money to make it happen, they need a technology platform to make it as easy as possible,\" Farwell told GeekWire. \"That is what we provide.\" Farwell graduated from Roger Williams University with a Bachelor's degree in economics. Ben Gilbert is a founding partner of Pioneer Square Labs, a \"startup studio\" that turns ideas into new companies and helps them get off the ground. But his entrepreneurial work goes further back than that. Gilbert is the former head of the Microsoft Garage, Microsoft's internal technology incubator, and co-founder of Madrona Venture Labs. He's been working in tech for nearly 15 years -- an impressive feat for a 27-year-old. Gilbert graduated from Ohio State University with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering, Entrepreneurship. Garett Ochs is always looking for problems that could be solved with technology -- the true mark of an entrepreneur. Shortly after graduating from the University of Washington, he built a phone case with a mirrored kickstand after many unsuccessful attempts to take a group selfie at a bar with friends. Now he's at the helm of Otto Robotics, a startup in stealth mode that's creating automated solutions for the restaurant industry. In January, Otto Robotics raised $1.5 million in private equity from investors like Draper Associates and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan Capital. Before Otto, Ochs was a mechanical engineer for Planetary Resources and Oculus. He has a Bachelor's degree in engineering and mathematics from UW. Yifan Zhang and Adam Stelle are pooling their combined startup experience to build Loftium. The startup, which is in stealth mode, promises to give home buyers \"a down payment in exchange for Airbnbing an extra bedroom for 12-36 months and splitting the income with us,\" according to the Loftium website. Zhang previously co-founded fitness app Pact and e-commerce site Styleta. She has a Bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard. Stelle was the former COO at Startup Weekend, founding partner at UP Global and entrepreneur in residence at Pioneer Square Labs.  Holding a bachelor's degree in Philosophy from the University of British Columbia, he also previously co-founded audio startup Spoke.am. ",

      "content": "Coastline helps restaurants place orders directly from fishermen. (Coastline Image)\n You'd be hard-pressed to find a marketplace more analog than fishermen selling seafood straight from the dock at the crack of dawn. Coastline Market sees that as a big opportunity. The Vancouver, B.C. startup has developed a digital marketplace that connects restaurants and retailers with local fishing operations. The platform allows customers to place and track orders, pay online, and find out where and how their seafood was harvested. Coastline CEO Robert Kirstiuk got the idea after watching dock workers sell the day's catch. He started asking more questions about the industry and quickly realized he could make the process more efficient using technology. Twenty-five restaurants and six fishing boats in Vancouver already use Coastline's platform. The startup is currently working through the Techstars Seattle 2017 class. We caught up with Kirstiuk for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"We connect restaurants and retailers to local commercial fishermen. We help eliminate middlemen with our online platform.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"I was visiting family in New Brunswick, Canada when I wondered why some fishermen preferred to sell direct off the dock instead of selling directly in the city. This opened up a whole new set of questions and thinking about the fishing industry for us. VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"VC and Angel. With the advent of accessible technology in the fishing industry, we have a unique opportunity to move quickly and build a defensible model through network effects. Growth funding from VCs and Angels provides us with the best opportunity to grow to critical mass and establish a global presence in the shortest timeframe possible.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Unlike traditional wholesalers, we utilize a just-in-time system to eliminate the need for cold storage or warehousing. This radically reduces the environmental and capital cost of preserving seafood, while providing clarity and transparency throughout the supply chain.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Moving to Seattle to accelerate our company through Techstars.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"We hastily built our initial prototype without customer feedback, and ended up delivering a narrow-sighted solution with poor product-market fit. In the end, we had to discard the old codebase and start from scratch.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Gates. His unique mix of intelligence, philanthropy, and results-driven attitude really resonates with our core values as a company.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Eating! Everyone on our team is a self-proclaimed Foodie.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Cultural alignment. As a company, we're focused on hiring people that live and breathe our anchor values. We care about getting the right people on our boat; not putting them in the perfect seat. Technical aptitude and expertise is something that can be learned over time - alignment is not.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Never underestimate the inertia of large corporations. The biggest reason why ideas never become reality is because of the prevailing notion that someone out there with more resources, information or expertise must have thought about/executed on the opportunity.\" Editor's note: GeekWire is featuring each of the companies in the Techstars Seattle 2017 accelerator as they prepare for their Demo Day April 19.

      "content": "Siren co-founders Susie Lee, left, and Katrina Hess. (Lance Mercer Photo)\n Sound the alarm for women looking for something other than traditional dating apps: Siren is shutting down. The Seattle-based app, which billed itself as an alternative to sites such as Tinder and Match.com with a focus on empowering women, is closing its doors after running out of money. Siren co-founder Susie Lee penned a blog post Tuesday detailing the reasons for the company's shutdown. She noted that Blackrun Ventures, which last year invested $225,000 as part of Siren's seed round, had never \"completed their obligation.\" \"Instead, we received small, unpredictable amounts, with the other investors courageously stepping forward,\" Lee wrote. \"Through the dedication of these committed individuals we were able to continue development, however we could never plan beyond a few months, hindering growth, milestones, and new funding opportunities.\" In an interview with GeekWire, Lee said that \"all closing docs had been signed, but [Blackrun Ventures] never completed their commitment.\" \"Instead, they issued small, unpredictable tranches, often with months in between, despite sometimes daily requested updates and repeated assurances,\" Lee noted. Blackrun Ventures, which invested as part of its women-focused investment arm, still lists Siren on its portfolio page. We've reached out to the firm for more details and will update this post when we hear back. Update: On Friday, Blackrun responded to GeekWire and provided this statement: \"Blackrun Ventures joined a number of investors to participate in Siren's $500,000 seed funding round. As the lead investor, we committed $225,000, of which 75% was disbursed over the last 12 months following the completion of due diligence. We were committed to providing the remainder of the investment to support Siren's expansion, and sent our consultant to work with the team on their strategic direction. Unfortunately, the founders made a decision on April 4th to close down the company. The dating app market is crowded and highly competitive, but our reasons for investing in Siren were strategic, and we were won over by the vision and passion of the company's founders. Nevertheless, while we still see potential for the business, particularly internationally, we respect their decision.\" \"Despite the uncertainty shadowing us, we did our best to build on our momentum, doing everything within our power to stay afloat,\" Lee wrote in the blog post. \"But without a way to harness and distribute funds for expansion, we simply could not grow fast enough. The efforts of two co-founders alone were not enough to compete with the well-funded companies in this space. Unfortunately, this comes at a time when Siren showed strong traction--relocation and expansion to New York, the formation of key partnerships, and user success stories that let us know we were onto something special.\" Founded in 2014 by Lee and co-founder Katrina Hess, who served as COO, Siren differentiated itself from other dating apps by prioritizing women's safety and allowing users to engage through their answers to daily questions provided by local businesses and local cultural icons. The app relied on conversation as a starting point rather than long profiles or photo surfing. \"We've created the first mobile platform designed for unexpected and constructive flirting,\" Lee told GeekWire in 2014. After winning the GeekWire App of the Year award in 2015, Lee and Hess relocated Siren to New York City this past September as entrepreneurs-in-residence at the New Museum's incubator program, NEW INC. Lee said the company was \"pre-revenue,\" but had a three-pronged revenue model vision that included online-to-offline partnerships with local businesses, paid subscriptions, and \"psychometric data analysis of aggregate user responses.\" The app had 38,000 registered users, with an 80 percent response rate to initial messages, Lee noted. Siren had raised $960,000. Its only current employees are the two co-founders, who are both now back in Seattle. Here's Lee's full blog post: It is with heavy hearts--and eyes to the future--that we must announce that Friday, April 7, 2017, Siren will be closing our \"doors.\" While it's not unusual for a startup to run out of money, the way we ran out was as unexpected as it was devastating. At the beginning of 2016, we closed our round with a lead investor whose mission was to support female-centric companies and who saw the potential in Siren's clear differentiation in a saturated market. Yet, as of this writing, a full calendar year later, they have not completed their obligation. Instead, we received small, unpredictable amounts, with the other investors courageously stepping forward. Through the dedication of these committed individuals we were able to continue development, however we could never plan beyond a few months, hindering growth, milestones, and new funding opportunities. Despite the uncertainty shadowing us, we did our best to build on our momentum, doing everything within our power to stay afloat. But without a way to harness and distribute funds for expansion, we simply could not grow fast enough. The efforts of two co-founders alone were not enough to compete with the well-funded companies in this space. Unfortunately, this comes at a time when Siren showed strong traction--relocation and expansion to New York, the formation of key partnerships, and user success stories that let us know we were onto something special. Indeed, we are enormously proud of Siren's accomplishments and impact. One of our goals was to change the course of this industry--an industry historically run by men, rampant with harassment, objectification, and immaturity at every level. And as newer, better funded companies like Bumble and Hinge market themselves as relationship-friendly alternatives to Tinder, we can see how our early and persistent efforts to humanize the online dating space have influenced the conversation, and we hope this industry continues to grow in that direction. Every day our Question of the Day (QOTD) hosts brought a creative new question to the table, and as a result, Siren has amassed one of the best repositories of quality ice-breakers in online dating history. At the end of our run, our QOTD hosts included Arianna Huffington, Anita Sarkeesian, and Esther Perel. Working with these inspiring women was a dream come true for us, and we only wish we had the runway to match the rest of our hustle. Siren was a lightning rod for progressive spirit in the tech community, bringing together a dynamic group of advisors and investors whose fundamental integrity and respect for women's issues is unparalleled and unique. It was only after meeting hundreds of people in tech that we could truly appreciate the courage and forward-thinking determination of everyone who signed on to help Siren make the tech world a more intuitive, humane place. Our advisors and investors rallied us on and supported us in our darkest days, and here at the end, they are with us, restating how honored they are to have been part of this venture. Siren's story inspired over 200 pieces of press, from the front page of the Seattle Times to CNN, NPR and the Guardian, to Bustle, the Stranger and The Establishment. Durex reached out to us to partner on a marketing campaign #Connect that garnered over 37 million views. We won Geekwire's App of the year, beating Starbucks and Alaska Airlines in 2015. We presented at TEDx. We spoke at Grace Hopper, the world's largest conference on women in technology, and we partnered with experimental marketing group Hello Velocity on a viral Tinder hack that satirized the objectification inherent in the swipe-to-reject model. We became entrepreneurs in residence at the New Museum's incubator, NEW INC in New York City. And we accomplished all of this with a marketing budget of zero dollars and a team that never grew beyond 2-4 core members. Some founders of social networks have revealed that they began to dislike their members as they grew, a sentiment we found surprising, as we have always loved our community: a creative, optimistic, and thoughtful group who supported us from the very beginning, kindly reporting issues, enthusiastically sharing their beautiful success stories, and thanking us for helping them find someone who saw them in a real, intimate, and deeply human way. One woman told us that she had not been able to date for over seven years, and met a wonderful, kind man on Siren who had renewed her faith in relationships. Another wrote, \"In March 2015, I introduced myself to someone. I'm happy to say two years later we're still enjoying each other's company and refer people to your app all the time. Thanks for a great, easygoing way to introduce yourself online.\" Some jobs require a leap of faith to imagine that you are doing something meaningful in the world, but every time our members share a success story or their wedding photo with us, we knew the work we were doing was important. These are the people we knew we were fighting for. It was their chance, unexpected encounters that let us know our mission was worthwhile, and it is for that community most of all that we grieve this loss. Siren's ethos of fostering real conversations in a comfortable space based on mutual respect will live on in our future projects forever. Follow us individually to hear what happens next, and thank you so very much for your enthusiasm, your partnerships, your hope for our success, and your sharing in our every triumph and struggle. We can't thank our community enough for standing beside us and showing the world that Siren's mission was a vital presence in the history of online dating. Goodbye, and thanks for everything.

      "content": "Solving the New York Times crossword in the Puzzazz app, switching automatically between digital pen and pencil using Apple Pencil, while watching a movie using Apple Split View on an iPad. (Puzzazz Image)\n Puzzle technology company Puzzazz has a history of developing novel input techniques for people who solve crosswords and other puzzles on mobile devices, and it's continuing the tradition with the latest update to its digital puzzle bookstore and puzzle-solving app for Apple's iOS. The newly released Puzzazz 5.0 comes with a feature that let solvers using an Apple Pencil or 3D Touch automatically switch between virtual pencil and pen input modes depending on the amount of pressure they put on the screen. A lighter touch results in virtual pencil mode, while a harder press activates pen mode, eliminating the need to manually switch between the two modes. The company says it's the first such usage of pressure-sensing technology. The feature works in Puzzazz with the Apple Pencil on iPad Pro and with regular finger input on iPhones that support 3D Touch. Virtual pen and pencil input have been available previously in the Puzzazz app, but not the ability to switch between them based on pressure. Virtual pencil input helps solvers remember which letters they were less confident about, and it doesn't count those answers against them when determining if they've correctly solved the puzzle. If the puzzle is completely filled in with pen with at least one wrong entry, it's marked incorrect. In testing, solvers were able to discover how the new pressure-sensitive switching worked without reading any documentation, a testament to the amount of work that the Redmond, Wash., startup put into the feature. \"We knew we wanted it to feel natural, but getting from that basic idea to something that feels right meant building, testing, tweaking, and iterating until it worked naturally and smoothly,\" explained Roy Leban, Puzzazz CEO and founder. \"Nobody had ever done this before, so it wasn't like we could look at what others had done.\" In addition, the updated app works with Apple's Split View feature on supported iPad models, for solving a puzzle in a portion of the screen while watching a video or other content side-by-side with the puzzle. Puzzazz also supports the iPad's Slide Over feature, letting solvers search for answers on the web without leaving the app. Puzzazz is akin to Kindle for puzzles -- an app for purchasing puzzle e-books and solving a wide variety of puzzles. It recently surpassed 100 puzzle e-books in its store. The app offers free daily KenKen and Sodoku puzzles, and gives New York Times digital crossword subscribers a high-tech platform for solving the popular NYT puzzles. Support for the New York Times puzzles was simplified and improved in this latest version. Other new features in the latest Puzzazz update include Bluetooth keyboard support, the ability to rate puzzles, and support for Quick Actions -- the option to use 3D Touch to go straight to the NYT crossword or featured titles from the iOS home screen. The app continues to offer Puzzazz's previously released \"TouchWrite\" feature, which lets puzzle solvers trace letters and numbers in large form across the screen, automatically recognizing and inserting the characters into the fields of a crossword, Sodoku or other puzzle. TouchWrite is a previous Innovation of the Year winner in the GeekWire Awards. ",

(GeekWire Photo)\n The 2017 GeekWire Awards are less than a month away, so that means it's time to vote for the iconoclastic tinkerers, entrepreneurs and business leaders who are reshaping the way we live, work and play. We're kicking off online voting today, and we're doing it in style with one of the biggest award categories: Startup of the Year. This year's finalists are looking to revolutionize everything from transportation to retail to auto maintenance. The finalists also include a Fred Hutch spin-out that's pioneering a treatment for Leukemia, and a well-funded cloud tech startup that's led by the co-creators of Kubernetes. It's one of the strongest finalist groups we've ever seen. Now, it's up to you to help pick the winner. To qualify for this award, startup companies had to be based in the Pacific Northwest and four years old or less. We received dozens of nominations from GeekWire readers, and our illustrious judging panel helped us winnow the group to the five finalists. You can read more about each company and cast your ballot for one of the five finalists for Startup of the Year in the poll below. Over the next two weeks, we're opening voting in 14 GeekWire Awards categories, with GeekWire readers choosing their top picks from finalists selected by our panel of judges from community nominations. Check back on GeekWire each day to cast your ballots. All of the winners will be revealed at the GeekWire Awards -- presented by Wave Business -- on May 4 at the Museum of Pop Culture. Tickets are on sale for the big Awards show, but we sell out each year, so don't snooze if you want to join the fun. Tickets available here. A big thanks to League for sponsoring the Startup of the Year category. And, since we all know startup life can be stressful with plenty of ups and downs, each of the five finalists in this year's Startup of the Year category will receive a three-hour on-site visit from League's team of certified massage professionals. You'll be refreshed and limbered up by the time the Awards hit on May 4th!   Convoy: 10-4 good buddy! This Seattle startup is making inroads in transforming the trucking industry, creating a more efficient way to match truckers with the loads they carry. It's an $800 billion industry in the U.S., and Convoy has some big believers. Led by former Amazon general manager Dan Lewis, Convoy raised $16 million in venture capital last year from a who's who in the tech industry, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, Greylock and others. It also scored a major coup earlier this year when it poached Tim Prouty -- formerly of Uber and Isilon -- as its engineering leader. Heptio: You don't see many startup teams with the technical chops found at Heptio, which emerged last year with an $8.5 million series A investment from Accel and Madrona Venture Group. Heptio co-founders Craig McLuckie and Joe Beda were two of the original founders of the Google-based Kubernetes project, big names in the world of cloud computing and containerized software. Before that, they cut their teeth at Microsoft. Now, at Heptio, they see an opening to create a set of services around Kubernetes, an open source technology that helps developers manage large fleets of containers. It's geeky stuff, and Heptio sees an opportunity. \"It became clear to Joe and me that there's a gap we'd like to fill, which is providing this very neutral, open, community-friendly company to continue to evolve the agenda we started when were were inside Google,\" McLuckie told GeekWire last fall. Nohla Therapeutics: A 2015 spin-out from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Nohla Therapeutics is looking to transform the treatment of blood cancers through unique universal donor cellular therapies. The company, which uses technology originally pioneered by scientist and Chief Medical Officer Colleen Delaney, received a ringing endorsement last year when it scored a $43.5 million Series A investment from Arch Venture Partners, 5AM Ventures, and The Jagen Group, bringing total funding to $65 million. It also tapped pharmaceutical veteran Kathleen Fanning as its CEO earlier this year. ReplyYes: Seattle has a history of pioneering retail technology. And ReplyYes, led by startup vet and former Amazon general manager Dave Cotter, is looking to make the next stride in how products are sold. A spinout of Madrona Venture Labs, ReplyYes describes itself as a chat commerce startup, essentially making it easy for retailers to sell products via text message. It's first offering, The Edit, is focused on vinyl record sales, and allows customers to purchase records by simply replying \"yes\" to an offer. \"It's ridiculously frictionless,\" Cotter told GeekWire last year. ReplyYes has raised $6.5 million in startup financing. Wrench: Going to the auto mechanic shop to get your car fixed might rank right up there with dental visits. So, what if the auto mechanic came to you? That's the idea behind Wrench, a Seattle startup that brings car maintenance to your front door. Wrench, which raised $4 million in funding last month and is led by Seattle native and former InfoSpace exec Ed Petersen, currently operates its on-demand car mechanic service in Seattle, Phoenix, San Diego and Portland. Dubbed an Uber for car mechanics, Wrench's network of mechanics will work on cars in driveways, parking garages or office parking lots, with the company saying it can complete about 80 percent of maintenance issues on site. The company employs 30 people. ",

      "content": "Madrona Venture Group's S. Somasegar and Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia previously worked together as Microsoft executives. (Madrona Venture Group Photo)\n Snowflake Computing, the Silicon Valley-based cloud data warehouse startup that just announced a new engineering center in the Seattle region, has closed a $100 million funding round led by ICONIQ Capital, with Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group coming on board as a new investor. The additional funding will be used to expand Snowflake's data warehouse-as-a-service internationally, further develop its technology, and grow its engineering team with a \"special focus\" on building its new operations in Bellevue, Wash., the company said in announcing the funding this morning. \"We're growing like crazy,\" said Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia in an interview this week. \"It's a big world we're in, and it's time for us to expand and grow.\"  It's a huge market that's only growing every day as there's more data in the world.The additional funding underscores the strong investor interest in new enterprise technologies built natively for the cloud. The additional $100 million brings the San Mateo, Calif., company's total funding to $205 million. Previous investors Altimeter Capital, Redpoint Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures and Wing Ventures also participating in the new Series D funding round. Madrona's participation as a new investor also represents a reunion for Muglia and S. \"Soma\" Somasegar, a Madrona managing director who worked with Muglia for many years at Microsoft. Somasegar led Microsoft's Developer Division, while Muglia was president of the company's Server & Tools Business. Although this is a later-stage investment than Madrona typically makes, a variety of factors made it a compelling deal for the firm, Somasegar said in an interview. \"We get excited about people who are doing great things in the cloud, and this is one of the great companies in terms of what they are doing in the cloud and for the cloud, right from day one,\" Somasegar said. \"It's a huge market that's only growing every day as there's more data in the world.\" Confidence in Muglia and the Snowflake leadership team also played a significant role in Madrona's decision, Somasegar said. Snowflake was founded in 2012 by database architects and Oracle veterans Benoit Dageville and Thierry Cruanes. Its third co-founder, Marcin Zukowski, is credited with inventing vectorized query execution in databases. Its head of engineering, Sameet Agrawal, spent many years at Microsoft, heading the SQL Server Relational Database Engine. \"I have a tremendous amount of respect, admiration and appreciation for Bob,\" Somasegar said. \"Having that deep database background with a seasoned business leader like Bob makes for a great team. The team is awesome.\" Snowflake's new engineering office in Bellevue also positions Madrona to provide additional value to the company given the venture capital firm's presence in the Seattle region, he noted. Even though Snowflake's cloud data warehouse runs on AWS, it competes with Amazon's own Redshift data warehouse -- not an uncommon situation in the modern world of cloud technology. In a post about its participation in the round, Madrona cites a recent GigaOm analyst report that ranks Snowflake as the top cloud analytics database over Google BigQuery, Teradata, Azure Data Warehouse and AWS Redshift. Muglia said the new funding will allow the company to expand its sales reach, hiring more people in the U.S., while also covering geographies such as Europe and ultimately Asia. Snowflake currently has salespeople in London and plans to expand into other parts of Europe this year. At its Bellevue engineering office, the company is starting with team of four engineers and one product manager, but it's targeting at least 10 to 15 engineers this year and could eventually have as many as 50 to 100 engineers in the office, Muglia said previously. Snowflake declined to disclose the valuation placed on the company as part of the new investment round. ",

      "content": "Qumulo CEO Bill Richter. (Madrona Venture Group Photo)\n Qumulo has spent the past five years building out its cloud-based platform that helps companies store and manage their data usage. Now the company is ready to attract enterprise customers from around the world and become a globally-recognized brand. The Seattle startup today announced a $30 million investment round led by new investor Northern Light Venture Capital, with participation from previous investors like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Madrona Venture Group, Top Tier Capital Partners, and Tyche Partners. This follows a separate $32.5 million investment in June of last year. Total funding in the 5-year-old company is now $130 million. Qumulo helps clients in a variety of industries like film production, oil and gas, life sciences, and more not only store data, but also monitor it with real-time analytics. Qumulo CEO Bill Richter, who joined the company this past November, said the fresh investment is \"all about fueling growth.\" \"This round is all about taking a best of breed product that's built for the modern world, marrying it up with a world class leadership organization, and really going out and prosecuting a large, growing, and uncontested market,\" Richter told GeekWire. Richter took over for Qumulo co-founder Peter Godman, who is now CTO. The two colleagues previously worked together as executives at Isilon Systems -- as did Qumulo's two other co-founders Neal Fachan and Aaron Passey -- which sold to EMC for $2.25 billion in 2010, marking one of the biggest acquisitions in Seattle tech history. Richter, also a venture partner at Madrona Venture Group -- one of Seattle's top venture capital firms and one of Qumulo's earliest backers -- said he's more bullish about Qumulo compared to what he experienced at Isilon. \"Our opportunity is so much bigger than Isilon because the rate of data creation in the world is only accelerating,\" he said. \"The problem is even more pronounced; the market is so much larger; and the choices are much fewer for customers.\" The \"problem\" Richter referenced is all about how to manage and monitor a company's unstructured data usage. Qumulo helps companies understand where the consumption of resources is coming from and learn why so much data exists in the first place. Qumulo's Core product helps answers questions like, \"What was my data like six months ago?\" or, \"What data do I need to back up?\" or, \"What is driving my data growth?\" Qumulo Core can run on commodity hardware, dedicated appliances, or in virtual machines. \"Every business out there is becoming a digital business,\" Richter noted. \"Data is becoming the most important asset for any organization.\" Qumulo has more than 100 customers including companies like Crafty Apes, which used Qumulo to help with the 2D compositing for the opening scene in La La Land, and Sinclair Oil, which uses the technology for its new digital repository. Richter said Qumulo is in a $10 billion market, with few competitors given the complexity of the problem and potential solutions. He said three qualities -- software-defined (can run both on-premises and in the public cloud); built for modern scale; data analytics -- help separate Qumulo from other similar products. \"Customers today have really lousy choices,\" he explained. \"They can buy legacy solutions built in the 1990s or early 2000s from companies like Dell, Hitachi, or Net App, but those systems just fall over under today's definition of scale. They were never built to be able to store and manage information like the type of data we have today.\" Richter said some companies can rewrite their applications and try to leverage public cloud solutions like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure -- Qumulo views them as \"strategic partners\" -- but that most don't have the time, money, or expertise to do so. Qumulo employs 150 people and recently made a few key hires. In November it brought on tech industry vet Eric Scollard as its vice president of worldwide sales, and in February it hired Amazon and Chef veteran Jay Wampold as its vice president of marketing. \"There's been a lot of momentum around the leadership team and bringing in a new level of horsepower to really grow the business,\" Richter noted. As for a potential public offering, Richter said Qumulo \"certainly has the opportunity\" and will raise additional capital at some point in the future. \"But we're not really focused on things like an IPO,\" he said. \"We are focused on growing a long-term, highly successful and independent company. This financing round gives us a lot of flexibility and fuel to grow.\" Feng Deng, founding managing director of China-focused Northern Light Venture Capital, described Qumulo as a \"high-growth company at the crossroads of innovation and disruption.\" \"We are seeing a massive explosion in digital file data worldwide,\" Deng said in a statement. \"Qumulo addresses the challenge of unstructured data growth and management that incumbents have found impossible to solve. Northern Light is committed to helping entrepreneurs build world class companies through our expertise and resources and Qumulo fits that investment profile as a high-growth company at the crossroads of innovation and disruption.\" ",

      "content": "VentureKits Founder Leslie Feinzaig launched the Seattle Female Founders Alliance to help women in tech get ahead. (Photo by Meryl Schenker)\n I don't actually want to talk about how hard it is to be a woman in tech. I realize this is an unoriginal statement. Unfortunately, with time and experience, I've had to face the reality that our industry is not a meritocracy. Even though I want to believe it is. Last summer, inspired by my career in tech and the birth of my daughter, I started a company with a mission to introduce kids to entrepreneurship, so that all kids can have a more equal chance to become tomorrow's leaders. In the process, I learned firsthand what I had only heard about before. I thought it was hard to be a woman in technology. It pales in comparison to what you face as a female startup founder. And while venture-scale entrepreneurship is hard on anyone, consider this: only 2.19 percent of venture capital invested in 2016 went to female-founded companies. In other words, what is already a moonshot for men is orders of magnitude harder for women. The good news is that there is no shortage of people trying to help. I feel tremendous gratitude to all of them: mentors, investors, bankers, executives, connectors, lawyers, advisors, recruiters, event organizers, journalists, non-profits, activists, and more. I thank you all sincerely. Please, don't stop doing what you're doing. But it's hard for me to sit on the sidelines for long on an issue that affects me so personally. Like any entrepreneur, I would rather fix a problem than wallow in it. So I gave it some thought and decided to try something simple, a minimum viable idea: What if founders intentionally helped one another? What if we built an alliance that enabled our efforts to scale? I decided to lead by example, going out of my way to help every female founder by connecting with them, amplifying their message, and referring them to people who can really move the needle for their startup. Every time I did so, I asked them to pay it forward to other female founders. I realize these actions -- connect, amplify, refer -- could very well be the start of a future awesome acronym. But CAR? It's missing something. I have some ideas on what goes next. You can add yours in the comments. I also realize most people already do much of what I described. It's part of what you do as a startup advisor (in return for equity and sometimes cash), and many people do it for their friends for free. But if we always charge, and only help the female founders in our immediate circle, our efforts just won't scale. And without scale, we will never put a dent in the 2.19 percent. So, I started a private Facebook group and added all my female startup founder friends in and around Seattle. Then they added their friends, and they added their friends, and then there weren't many more women left to be added, because there are just not that many of us around here to begin with (see 2.19 percent). It didn't take long for group members to take the initiative and organize ways to help each other. All of the sudden, founders who had never met in person were having a direct and positive impact on each other within days of meeting online. We now call ourselves the Seattle Female Founders Alliance (I like to call us the 2.19 percent Alliance). As of today, we are 60 (and counting) startup founders, startup CEOs, and founders who have had an exit. The group includes every female startup founder or CEO to win a GeekWire Award and nearly every female founder or CEO to raise a major round locally in the last three years, as well as up and comers that most of you haven't heard of... yet. Wanna join? It's super easy! All you have to do is identify as a woman and start a venture-scale company or social enterprise, and work on it full time (or have a successful exit by the time you join). It must be legally incorporated, have an online presence, or other solid evidence that you really took the leap. If you check all those boxes, fill in this form and we'll be in touch. If you're not a female founder, but you support our mission, we want to hear from you too. Once you join, you will meet some of the most amazing women I have ever come across. You will most likely experience their active support straight away. You will get a chance to meet some in person at our private meetups. And you will benefit from the events we are collectively organizing -- like our inaugural Founders Showcase in May, a private event for Seattle's investing community to meet Seattle's Female Founders. But this isn't just a networking group. Joining comes at a price: a price you have to pay forward. You'll have to connect with other founders, learn about their company and ask how you can help. You'll have to amplify all the other founders' voices and messages. Sometimes you'll have to share the spotlight. You'll have to refer other worthy founders to needle-movers, like investors, media, customers, conference organizers, and potential employees. Imagine if you walked out of every investor meeting having name-dropped three other alliance members. Now imagine we all did the same, every founder, at every meeting, with every investor. Individually we are drops of water. Together, we're a thunderstorm. Seattle female founders and CEOs, and female founders of the world: We need each other. Let's help each other succeed. Join us and pledge to connect, amplify, refer, and the other thing(s) that are missing from the future awesome acronym. Let's break the 2.19 percent, and not just by a little. And when we do, let our startup stories and battle scars have no more to do with our gender, and everything to do with our relentless quest for customer love, ROI, employee happiness, and positive societal impact.

(Hazel Photo)\n As Wisam Abdulla and his co-founders were building Canadian payroll startup Rise, they encountered a common complaint from customers again and again. Help with payroll was all well and good, they said, but how could they better manage their employees and foster company culture? Hazel is Abdulla and his team's answer. The Vancouver, B.C. startup uses software to help managers identify their weaknesses and improve as leaders. \"They say that employees don't leave companies, they leave managers -- and the research agrees,\" Abdulla said. \"And yet most manager training and development solutions are outdated and ineffective; they're often one-day courses that do little to change management long-term. Our goal is to give managers the tools and resources they need to grow and develop, based on the areas where their teams need them the most.\" Hazel is currently incubating in the Techstars Seattle accelerator. We caught up with Abdulla for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"Great managers build more engaged, enduring teams. Hazel gives clarity on where managers are struggling and tools to develop their skills.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"After hearing similar feedback hundreds of times in a row, we knew we were really onto something. The first four weeks of Techstars are designed to help you ensure that you're pointing in the right direction before spending the last eight weeks speeding forward. We spent our first four weeks talking to as many HR leaders and mentors as we could. We quickly realized that the biggest pain facing HR leaders (and their companies) today is developing their managers. In fact, every company we talked to said that they struggle to bring new managers up to speed, and that struggle ultimately leads to pain within the organization.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Angels first, then VCs. We believe that great managers can be transformative to every organization. It's a big problem space that we're excited to solve, and solving it would mean building a big business, which would require VC backing.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Our competitors in this space offer assessment without assistance or assistance without assessment. We show managers where they can improve based on employee feedback, use that feedback to drive personalized growth plans that help them level up, and then use feedback data to show real improvements.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Joining Techstars. It has been an amazing experience so far. The feedback from mentors and the pressure to execute have helped us challenge our assumptions and be more decisive in our approach.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"A few months ago, we hired someone who wasn't a good culture fit. At the time, we discussed it as a team and decided we'd compromise on fit in order to benefit from this highly-skilled person's much-needed expertise. We quickly learned that it's better to work with people whose values align with yours, and ultimately decided to go our separate ways.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Zuckerberg. He has done an exceptional job of building a fast-growing behemoth without sacrificing a fair and engaging workplace culture.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"We have a tradition of sabering a bottle of champagne every time we hit a major milestone. We currently have 20 bottles by our pod waiting to be cracked open. Don't tell anyone.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Because we're still early and a lot is in flux we look for people who are comfortable with a high degree of ambiguity. Of course, we also look for people who align with our core values: craftsmanship, joy, openness, close the gap, and ownership.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"You are the biggest cheerleader of your business. If you're not deeply excited about it, no one else will be.\" Editor's note: GeekWire is featuring each of the companies in the Techstars Seattle 2017 accelerator as they prepare for their Demo Day April 19.

      "content": "Ripl Chairman Andrew Wright and CEO Paul Ingalls.\n Ripl is raising more cash as the company sees more traction with its app that lets people create visual marketing content. The Seattle startup has reeled in another $3 million from existing investors. Trilogy Equity Partners led the round, which pushes total funding to $7.5 million to date. Other backers include angel investors like Mike Galgon, Richard Fade, Geoff Entress, Rudy Gadre, Charles Fitzgerald, and others. Ripl's app lets small businesses -- restaurant owners, fitness instructors, real estate agents, etc. -- create visual content that they can use for social media marketing. It's a free app, but users can pay $9.99 per month to access premium features like additional designs, custom logos, music libraries, scheduled posts, and more. Since last year, the company's paying customer base has grown by 20X and it just passed 1 million installs of the app, with more than 250,000 active small business users on the platform. It is currently the fourth-highest grossing photo and video app in the App Store. Ripl CEO Paul Ingalls told GeekWire that the vision going forward is to not only provide a way for small business owners to create social media content, but to give them a \"marketing team in their pocket.\" \"We believe we can provide a platform that simply and skillfully reduces the complexity of marketing while keeping the price point at less than three lattes a month,\" he noted. Ingalls said he and his 15-person team are big believers in the impact entrepreneurship can have around the world, both from an economic and social standpoint. He sees Ripl as one way to reduce barriers of entry for small business owners and help them sustain their operations. \"By providing the skills of a marketing team to these entrepreneurs, we can help increase the success rates of their businesses,\" he said. Ripl COO Clay McDaniel said the company will add new features like personalized recommendations and new languages as it aims to give users a holistic marketing tool on their mobile devices. \"Our team fervently believes that entrepreneurship is going to be an engine of business growth over the next several decades on a global scale,\" McDaniel said. \"The mobile internet revolution enables control of your own economic destiny.\" Ripl went through a series of pivots before eventually landing on Ripl. Ingalls and Ripl Chairman Andrew Wright, who previously worked together at Redmond-based Smilebox and Seattle-based RealNetworks, originally tried to crack into the sports content business back in 2012 with an app called Fanzo. They quickly realized that Fanzo was not differentiated enough from other sports-related services and shifted to the first iteration of Ripl, which helped social media influencers leverage their online fanbase to make money. Ripl began to see some traction, but the app wasn't seeing enough user growth or monetization uptick. The startup decided to narrow its focus on one pillar of the app -- visual content creation -- and that's what ultimately led to what Ripl is today.  \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Studies show entrepreneurship is on the rise. (Shutterstock Photo)\n The Great Recession struck a major and lasting blow to entrepreneurship but the nation's startup ecosystem appears to finally be recovering. That's according to a new study from the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI), a moderate think tank and policy advocate, and TechNet, an advocacy group comprised of tech CEOs. The study (aimed at persuading local and federal governments to enact policy that promotes innovation) analyzed government data and job listings to determine the health of startups in the U.S. and the impact they have on job growth and the overall economy. Bureau of Labor statistics from 2015 to 2016 reveal that new establishments -- that is new startups or businesses that expand to new locations -- are finally increasing after years in a recession valley. \"The creation of new establishments finally accelerated in 2015 and 2016 -- not just in the leading tech hubs, but in smaller states and communities as well,\" writes PPI chief economist Michael Mandell. \"Overall, the number of private-sector establishments increased by 2.5 percent in the first three-quarters of 2016, the fastest rate of growth since before the Great Recession, and just below the 2.7 percent average rate of the 1990s.\" Researchers also studied the content of job listings on Indeed.com, to find out how frequently the word \"startup\" appeared. They claim the presence of the word -- even in listings from big companies that claim to operate like startups -- indicates a culture that values entrepreneurship. The presence of the word \"startup\" increased by 60 percent between 2014 to 2016, according to the study. PPI and TechNet are encouraged by these numbers because they see an increase in startup creation as a big driver of jobs. Mandell also notes that this growth isn't just taking place in coastal hubs like San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, and New York. Unsurprisingly, those tech centers dominated the study's top 10 list of metro areas where \"startup\" appeared most frequently in job listings. But Mandell says it's equally important to look at the regions lower on the top 25 list as up-and-coming centers of innovation and entrepreneurship.  A 2016 Kauffman Index Report backs up the PPI's findings that startup ecosystems are bouncing back. The study also supports the theory that startup growth is spreading across the country, beyond traditional tech hubs. Washington D.C., Columbus, Ohio, Nashville, Tenn., and San Antonio, Texas, were all on the Kauffman Index's top 10 list of metros with the highest growth in entrepreneurship activity. The Kauffman study calls this phenomenon \"The Rise of the Rest.\" \"From Chicago to New Orleans, Nashville to Los Angeles, vibrant new companies are being formed that have the potential to become significant job creators -- particularly if nourished and supported by the right public policies,\" Mandell writes. Nudging the government toward those public policies is the impetus for the study. The PPI is imploring the federal government to reconsider rules governing crowdfunding and investing, to double down on STEM education and R&D, and to reform immigration policy to promote entrepreneurship. \"The recent acceleration of establishment growth suggests that [economic] dynamism may be slowly starting to revive -- but it is not enough,\" Mandell says.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed. \"We are excited to be part of a much bigger footprint where our technology can make an impact as part of a broader solution selling into payers and health systems,\" said EveryMove CEO Russell Benaroya. \"Our partner, Premera Blue Cross, has been instrumental in supporting us to reach an exit.\" EveryMove will maintain an office here in Seattle and grow its team, Benaroya said. In 2015, the startup endured two rounds of layoffs in an attempt to reduce cash burn. EveryMove is a graduate of the Techstars Seattle startup accelerator. Higi operates a network of more than 10,000 health screening stations at grocery and drug stores around the country. Consumers can use the kiosks to get information about their personal health and higi manages that data to provide insights to pharmacists and healthcare providers. The company has collected data from 36 million unique users and also gets wellness information from about 80 connected devices, wearables, and apps. \"This investment, along with the integration of EveryMove, further extends higi's leadership in enabling population health and our ability to help our payer, provider, retail, and brand customers to drive behavior change, cost savings, and improved health,\" higi CEO Jeff Bennett said in a press release Wednesday. We've reached out to EveryMove for additional comments and will update this story when we hear back.  ",

      "content": " Limitless today announced a partnership to integrate its character building technology into High Fidelity, the virtual reality \"metaverse\" created by Second Life founder Philip Rosedale. Those using High Fidelity's open source software toolset, which lets people create shared VR environments, will now be able to build interactive characters with Limitless' technology starting on Wednesday. Limitless, a Bellevue-based startup created by former Pixar and Bungie character designer Tom Sanocki, last year launched a platform that lets anyone -- film companies; advertisers; educators; regular consumers; etc. -- create interactive virtual reality characters. High Fidelity, meanwhile, debuted its beta product one year ago. Rosedale previously built online virtual world Second Life; his new company is similar, but geared toward virtual reality. It raised an $11 million Series A round led by Vulcan Capital in February 2015 and reeled in another $22 million this past December. \"Our partnership with High Fidelity opens up the creation of VR interactive characters to far more people,\" Sanocki said. \"Now you don't need to be an game developer to build an interactive character -- a user can simply create one on High Fidelity by editing a text file, or if you're more technically inclined, you can extend it using JavaScript.\" High Fidelity users will be able to create characters that respond to voice, gestures, and other human social cues, similar to how Limitless' technology was used in this VR experience. \"VR worlds are made more alive and believable by emotional connections to characters within them.\" Philip Rosedale said in a statement. \"We want to give people the ability to easily create interactive characters, getting as close as possible to the magical experience of having other living people in the space with you.\" Sanocki said the partnership will \"give us a glimpse into the future of VR.\" \"High Fidelity's users are generally pro-sumers with basic technical knowledge, and range from educators to enthusiasts to professional animators,\" he said in a statement. \"Our integration within High Fidelity further validates that our storyteller-first approach to interactive characters is ready for widespread adoption.\" In October, Limitless rolled out its animated character development toolset for developers to leading film and animation studios. The 12-person company has raised investment from music and film producer Jay Rifkin, who worked on \"The Lion King\" film's original score; and Masi Oka, a game startup leader and former Industrial Light & Magic digital effects artist better known as the character Hiro from the NBC series \"Heroes.\" Limitless was also just accepted into HTC's Vive X accelerator fund and named former Dreamworks Animation executive Ian Richter to its advisory board. Recent hires include new COO Pamela Choy, who was previously a member of Pixar's senior management team, and Jon Collins, the new creative director and head of animation who has experience at companies like ToyTalk, Pixar, Blue Sky, ILM, and Blizzard.

      "content": "Wrench says its mechanics serviced more than 1,000 cars during a test run this summer. (Via Wrench)\n Investors like what they see in Wrench. The Seattle-based on-site car repair startup today announced a $4 million Series A round led by Madrona Venture Group, which previously co-led the company's $1.2 million seed round last year. Angel investors like super angel Rudy Gadre; TravelBank co-founder Ching-Ho Fung; former Dwellable CEO Kirby Winfield; Versium founder Kevin Marcus; and angel group Vashon Partners also participated. Wrench will use the fresh cash to hire mechanics, fuel marketing programs, and expand its presence on the west coast. The 1-year-old company currently operates in Seattle; Phoenix; San Diego; and Portland. Much like Uber brings you a ride and GrubHub brings you food, Wrench brings you a car mechanic. Using its website or smartphone app, customers can input work they need done on their vehicle and when and where they would like mechanics to go. Anything from an office parking lot to a downtown parking garage to a customer's driveway is fair game, though Wrench will not work on cars parked on the street for safety reasons. A certified mechanic with at least five years of experience will perform work at a customer's home or office, with upfront fixed price quotes. Wrench says it can do more than 80 percent of all car repair and maintenance work that can be done outside of a shop. Much like Uber or Lyft, tips aren't required. Examples of jobs include replacing brake pads; fixing an ignition problem; diagnosing exhaust issues; and more. The company initially limited its services to oil changes, tune-ups and basic brake repair, but high demand led Wrench to expand services to cover almost anything that a shop or dealership would provide. \"Wrench continues to invest in its technology, which provides a huge advantage in this industry, and the hiring of the highest quality mechanics,\" Wrench CEO Ed Petersen told GeekWire. Wrench, which employs 30 people, will also add new services for customers and ink more partnerships to bolster its on-demand marketplace. Total funding to date is $5.3 million. Wrench said it saves people an average of 2.4 hours of travel and wait time; it also claims to be as much as 30 percent less expensive than car dealership service bays, while its prices are on par with independent car repair shops. Its service is backed by a 1-year, 12,000 mile guarantee on both parts and labor. Peterson has been working with the same team for more than a decade. He and some his current colleagues founded and sold Intelius, a public record search company, and TalentWise, which does background checks and other screening services. The car repair industry is pegged at around $60 billion. There are other companies like Wrench -- namely, Your Mechanic, which just raised $24 million earlier this month. And then there's Fiix, which just launched out of Y Combinator. \"U.S. consumers spend more than $60 billion annually on car repairs and maintenance and the service model hasn't changed meaningfully since the invention of the oil change shop,\" Madrona Managing Director Len Jordan said in a statement. \"Wrench applies modern mobile, internet commerce and data analytics techniques to this market and delivers a physical service that consumers need multiple times a year.\" ",

      "content": "Steven Koltai speaks at InBIA in Seattle on Monday. (GeekWire photo)\n Can entrepreneurship promote political stability and peace in countries around the world? Steven Koltai certainly believes so. The long-time startup junkie, who was most recently a senior advisor for entrepreneurship at the U.S. Department of State under former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, spoke at the 31st International Conference on Business Incubation hosted by InBIA, a global network of entrepreneurs, in Seattle on Monday. After launching two companies and working as an investment banker, management consultant, and media industry executive, Koltai took a job with the U.S. government under Clinton in 2009 and helped create the Global Entrepreneurship Program, which focused on job creation via entrepreneurship in Muslim-majority countries. Koltai, who now runs his own consulting company, rehashed some of the main takeaways from his book, Peace through Entrepreneurship. \"I wrote this book based on one simple premise: joblessness is the single biggest cause of political unrest and violence in the world,\" Koltai said. \"And the single best way to create jobs is through entrepreneurship. There is a straight line connection between entrepreneurship, jobs, political stability, and peace.\" Koltai is focused on how the U.S. can help spur entrepreneurship in developing countries, many of which do not have the resources or cultural norms that help promote startup creation. Unsurprisingly, many people ask him why the U.S. should be involved in job creation abroad, rather than doing the same at home. He said this type of outreach directly impacts the U.S. itself -- particularly with security. Koltai noted how \"all of the wars since World War II, we have lost.\" \"We probably should have learned that traditional warfare is not making us safer; it is not making the world more peaceful,\" he explained. \"So maybe we could take a tiny, tiny, tiny portion of what we spend on what is by far the the largest discretionary spending area of government, and spend it on an alternative method of security creation, which is job creation.\" Koltai provided evidence of how joblessness in different countries going through crisis creates unrest -- that in turn can threaten international security, he said. \"Huge rates of unemployment generally drives people, especially young people, to desperation,\" Koltai said. He also showed how countries that invest and encourage entrepreneurship can create wealth much faster than those who do not, both on an individual basis and on a national economy basis. For example, Singapore and Jamaica shared many similarities in 1965 -- island countries, British colonies, similar populations, same per-capita income, etc. But fast forward to today and Jamaica is one of the poorest countries in the world while Singapore is one of the wealthiest. \"Part of the driver of that wealth was a focus on entrepreneurship and improving the business climate that existed in Singapore,\" Koltai said. \"From a purely economic standpoint, it was transformative.\" Koltai hopes that the U.S. will spend more of its foreign aid budgets on entrepreneurship promotion. He said the U.S. spends less than countries like Canada, Sweden, and The Netherlands in absolute dollars. \"Not only do we spend very little, but we spend it very badly,\" he added. So how do cities and countries promote entrepreneurship? Koltai developed a \"Six + Six Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Model,\" which highlights the six actions he believes is required to create more jobs and companies (click to enlarge):  \"We believe that only through this comprehensive, holistic approach can true progress toward a healthy entrepreneurial ecosystem be achieved,\" Koltai writes on his site.

      "content": "MetaJure founder Marty Smith believes the company's software can help legal aid providers be more efficient. (MetaJure Photo)\n Many tech companies wait until they grow into big corporations before thinking about corporate social responsibility. But MetaJure, a Seattle startup that provides software to help lawyers manage their documents and email, is starting early. As early as the company's Series A funding round, in fact. MetaJure is using its $2.6 million round as an opportunity for what its founder and director Marty Smith calls \"social investing.\" For every dollar MetaJure raises, the equivalent value (in the form of the company's product) will go toward legal aid providers around the country. \"A 'social investment' is any investment that seeks to produce a financial return to the investor while also producing a social good. Usually, the social good is produced as the company grows, as might be the case by investing in an alternative energy company wherein over time, carbon dioxide emissions are increasingly reduced. We felt, however, a strong sense of urgency to make an immediate difference so we decided to bring an 'impact investing' component into play as well, namely where a person's financial investment causes an immediate social impact.\" The program led to the installation of MetaJure's technology at Georgia Legal Services, Pine Tree Legal Assistance in Maine, Colorado Legal Services, and Legal Aid Society of Orange County. MetaJure also plans to equip Arkansas Legal Services, Utah Legal Services, and the Northwest Justice Project, in Washington, with its product in the next few weeks. In addition to the software, MetaJure provided installation and support training. MetaJure also agreed to continue licensing the software to the legal aid providers as long as they continue using it. MetaJure always planned to give back through philanthropy once the business was fleshed out and profitable but the company's leadership saw a more immediate need that couldn't wait. \"Recent political events have compounded the problem by increasing the need for legal advice on hate crimes and immigration,\" Smith said. \"At the same time, President Trump's proposed budget eliminates all funding for the Legal Services Corporation, the primary source of financial support for legal aid throughout the country.\" When MetaJure's series A closes, the company will look at other ways to support legal aid providers. One option under consideration is donating the software on a law firm's or legal department's behalf in an amount equal to their purchase. The company has raised about $7 million to date. Beyond supporting legal aid, MetaJure plans to use the fresh cash to bolster its sales efforts. \"MetaJure's board believes access to justice is a foundational pillar of our democracy,\" Smith said. \"Not surprisingly, we felt a strong desire to see what we could do to make a difference today.\" ",

(GeekWire photo)\n You'd be hard pressed to find a bigger believer in the value of startups than John Harthorne. The MassChallenge CEO gave the opening keynote at the 31st International Conference on Business Incubation hosted by InBIA, a global network of entrepreneurs, in Seattle on Monday. In 2009, Harthorne helped launch MassChallenge, a global non-profit organization that runs five accelerators around the world which are unique because they don't take equity from startups. More than 1,200 companies from a wide variety of industries -- alumni include Tellus Labs; Adhesys Medical; TapLink; and others -- have gone through the program and went on to collectively raise $1.8 billion in funding while creating 60,000 jobs. Before starting Boston-based MassChallenge, Harthorne worked in a variety of industries before landing a consulting gig at Bain & Company. It was then when he realized that the \"system\" was too selfish and greedy -- \"everyone was fighting over slices of pie and there weren't enough people making pie,\" he noted. Harthorne and his co-founder Akhil Nigam thought there needed to be an easier way for people to launch businesses. \"Entrepreneurs are the salvation of humanity,\" Harthorne told the crowd. \"These are the value creators, the pie creators. They not only create a business, but many times, an entire industry.\" MassChallenge, which is funded largely from corporate sponsors like Microsoft and GE who get access to its startups, aims to remove friction from the startup creation process, placing the companies at the center of an innovation ecosystem that also includes government, investors, universities, media, foundations, and more. \"The goal is to organize everybody and create a model that engages all of them,\" Harthorne explained. \"It's like if you make a cake, you can't just say, let's put more eggs and get more cake out. The recipe has to be balanced. You need all these players to do more stuff and include them. And the realization is that all of them benefit from a startup.\" Its accelerators -- in Boston, London, Switzerland, Israel, and Mexico, with seven others launching by 2020 -- offer access to mentorship, office space, and a chance to win part of $3 million in equity-free cash awards. \"Our model, goal, and mission is to create a factory for startups,\" Harthorne explained. \"We're trying to create thousands of startups globally to try and change the way people interact with the economy, to be more creative and focused on adding value.\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

The Seattle startup today announced a $1 million investment from TechStars Ventures, Vulcan Capital, Divergent Ventures and angel investors. Total funding in the 4-year-old company is $2.5 million. Socedo, a 2013 graduate of the Microsoft Windows Azure accelerator, helps clients like Microsoft, Lenovo, Google, Extreme Networks, and more than 170 other customers streamline the process of finding sales leads on social media. The company's software combines real-time social media activity monitoring with profile data from sources like Twitter and LinkedIn. That information is then synced with a CRM or marketing platform like Salesforce or HubSpot. Socedo, which saw its revenue grow by 3X in 2016, will use the fresh funding to hire more employees, develop its platform -- including its predictive intelligence software -- and build out integrations with marketing automation providers. The company is also expanding its platform to help marketers not only find new leads through social media activity, but revive existing ones, too. \"With Socedo's social intent data we can provide marketers with insights on which of those existing leads might be in-market and deserve an outreach,\" explained Socedo CEO Aseem Badshah. \"We can also provide the marketer an understanding of what content to send that lead based on the real-time interest signals they have shown.\" Badshah, who founded Socedo in 2013 with Kevin Yu, said his company stays ahead of its competition by processing more relevant and real-time data about intent signals for potential sales leads. \"Most intent data providers can only tell you when a prospect is consuming content on a website they track,\" he said. \"Socedo can provide insights when a prospect engages with a competitor or any other entity on a public social network like Twitter.\" Socedo employs 25 people, nearly double from this time last year.  \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

Tod McDonald was appointed Lead Forensic Accountant to investigate a 2012 scam in which Frederick Darren Berg defrauded investors out of $100 million through the Meridian Mortgage investment funds he ran. McDonald spent more than two years and $2 million on professional fees trying to figure out where the money went. \"When he started, you couldn't trust the books and accounting systems or financial statements, so Tod had to go to the source of all monetary inflow and outflow bank activity to get conclusive answers,\" said Valid8 CEO Chris McCall. They knew there had to be a better way. Together, they began building Valid8, a platform that provides insights into complex cash flow networks and validates financial documents. The tools are designed to simplify the process for auditors, lenders, and other professionals who need to make objective decisions based on bank statements and financial records. \"When we recognized the value of applying a high level of scrutiny and understanding up front before bad things happen, Valid8 was born,\" McCall said.

Shortcuts like statistical sampling and looking at account balances versus considering every single transaction meant the CPA firms and their customers were exposed to unnecessary risk and ambiguity. Eliminating the shortcuts by using big data analytics and data processing algorithms to consider every single banking transaction not only provides a comprehensive picture of reality - but automates and accelerates a vast array of existing procedures.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Bootstrap to revenue, then smart VC/Angel money that adds credibility to the company.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"The ability to aggregate all bank activity, match them to accounting records, and report on the differences.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Applying for Techstars and then joining the class in Seattle this year has been a great move.

We should have quit our day jobs sooner and focused earlier than we did. We're motivated to give it our all now more than ever.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"It's a tough call, but we'd choose Bezos.

Atlas CEO Jordan Ritter, who was previously a co-founder of Napster, confirmed the layoffs in an email to GeekWire on Monday. The Seattle-based startup now employs 23 people, down from 34 this past November when it raised a $20.7 million investment round. The company's software acts as a personal search engine, running in the background on users' computers to capture an encrypted record of their activity across different apps and services. The idea is to help users quickly locate information within files, emails, and other personal data. Atlas came out of stealth mode in November 2015 as the first company spun out of Seattle startup innovation studio Ivy Softworks, also started by Ritter. The idea for Ivy Softworks was to create an \"innovation studio\" -- not an accelerator or incubator -- that keeps the same employees together to work on product after product. As Ritter explained to GeekWire in 2014, in his view, it was inefficient to spend time recruiting a whole new set of A-team players or finding new office space every time a new business idea emerges. When Atlas first spun out of Ivy Softworks, all of the employees from Ivy Softworks shifted to work for Atlas. Last year, Ritter said that Softworks \"has been put on pause for now, but the business continues to exist.\" Now, Ritter says its \"full focus is on Atlas.\" Here is his statement. As you know, we've been in a transition from a product-oriented innovation studio to a lean, business-focused startup. To complete the transition we let go 10 of our valued colleagues, whose dedication and efforts I'm tremendously thankful for. Our recruiter is working with them to find their next role, many of whom will be securing opportunities in the next week. Our full focus is on Atlas, which we launched in open beta into November, and we have since received a strong reception from users, media and the market. This positive feedback has validated our approach to personal search, and accelerated our development of contextual suggestions, a new kind of technology that intelligently suggests what you need in the moment and proactively organizes your digital life for you. A web archive from January shows 11 employees who are no longer listed on Atlas' \"about\" page, including several engineers and a product designer who had been at Atlas for more than three years. The company has no open positions on its jobs page. This past November, Atlas raised $20.7 million from Microsoft, Aspect Ventures, and Nathan Myhrvold, the Intellectual Ventures co-founder and former Microsoft CTO. Microsoft invested on behalf of the company itself, not its Microsoft Ventures arm. At the time, Atlas also released its first product, Atlas Recall, in open beta for Mac users, along with an iOS companion app. The company is also working on a Windows 10 version of the product. ",

The Seattle startup has reeled in another $400,000 from angel investors, bringing its total funding to date to nearly $2 million. Founded in 2014 by veteran entrepreneurs that pioneered \"Internet-in-a-Box\" technology back in the 90s, Switch develops financial-related technology. Its first product is a credit card updater for online accounts, giving customers an efficient way of keeping their payment methods up-to-date, along with better visibility of their cards. The idea is to help people easily update online payment information on various websites when replacing a credit card that was lost, stolen, or expired. This can be a frustrating and time-consuming process that is becoming more common with the increasing number of online services people are using on a daily basis that requires credit card information, from Amazon.com to Uber to Spotify to Netflix. Switch just launched early access to its free service last month. \"Today, credit and debit cards are the dominant payment solutions for consumers,\" Switch CEO Chris Hopen said in a statement. \"Switch is the first ever consumer payment solution that automates both the challenge of secure account access and the 'card on file' problems users face every day.\" Switch also offers end-to-end encryption, two-factor authentication, and additional features as part of its security offerings. Hopen founded Switch with former colleague David Pool. The founders previously worked together at Spry, a company that sold Internet connection software packages which allowed people to surf the web using a computer running Microsoft Windows. Spry sold to Compuserve for $100 million in 1995, the \"largest acquisition yet in the Internet business\" according to a New York Times article published at the time of the sale. Pool was later CEO of a Bellevue-based enterprise content routing solution provider called DataChannel, a position he held from 1998 to 2002. During that time, Pool also started a venture capital firm called XMLfund that invested in XML-based web services. Pool left XMLFund in 2012. Hopen, meanwhile, left Spry in 1996 after the acquisition and eventually became the CTO at Aventail, a Seattle company that developed VPN technology. Aventail and DataChannel were business partners. Hopen later founded a Seattle-based file-sharing startup called TappIn, which sold to GlobeScape for as much as $17 million in 2011. Switch employs 10 people and just moved into new offices in Seattle's Pioneer Square neighborhood. ",

(Stacker Photo)\n Nate Taggart and Chase Douglas believe that server-less applications will become more popular than traditional apps over the next decade. What does that mean exactly? They foresee a shift from application development that depends on external servers to tools that operate with the same level of efficiency and security, without relying on a server. The product and engineering duo hopes to lead that revolution with Stackery.io. \"We want to build software tools to help developers unleash their creativity instead of focusing on mundane server management,\" said Taggart, who serves as CEO of the Portland-based startup. Taggart and Douglas started working together in 2013 when they joined forces to build the New Relic Browser. After New Relic went public, they moved to an early-stage startup and began working together on side projects using AWS Lambda. The challenges they experienced using that technology inspired them to launch Stackery. \"We decided to use our experience building developer tools together to help companies build and deploy world-class server-less applications with the same level of automation, safety, and security as legacy applications,\" Taggart said.

The Seattle startup has reeled in an additional $1.5 million from Broadmark Capital and angel investors. uZoom, which raised a $560,000 seed round last year, launched this past June with its marketplace for live streaming video, connecting people who want to see something in the world with those on the ground that are actually there. For example, during last year's Summer Olympics, uZoom provided a way for people to use their smartphones to live-stream from a bevy of locations -- swimming competitions, late night festivities, beaches, etc. -- and give viewers from around the world an alternate method to see what was going on in Brazil.  The idea is that people will pay a nominal fee to see something streamed live by a \"Zoomer,\" with uZoom providing the platform to make it happen. \"Whether you're curious about what it's like to go out to dinner in Japan or you'd like a first-hand look at an elk hunt in Montana, uZoom is a platform full of new experiences and opportunities through live streaming,\" the site reads. Some of the top categories on uZoom include \"street tours,\" \"neighborhood advice,\" \"current events,\" \"local sports,\" and more. Originally founded by digital media vet Martin Rincon, uZoom tapped Dean Graziano as its CEO last year. This past November, Graziano stepped down and was replaced by digital media veteran John Kueber, who was previously at Jrrny.com.

VendorHawk, a Seattle startup that helps companies understand and streamline their SaaS licenses, sees that inefficiency as an opportunity. Essentially, it's software product to help companies make sense of their other software products. So meta. \"As SaaS applications proliferate across the enterprise -- from marketing and sales to HR and basic office productivity -- companies are increasingly wasting huge amounts of money on unused licenses and misallocated budget,\" said Patrick Lowndes, the startup's CEO. \"VendorHawk solves that problem.\" Lowndes and his co-founder Brian Geisler started VendorHawk as a side project.

(BluHaptics Image)\n Telerobotics startup BluHaptics has raised $1.36 million to launch its first commercial product this summer and expand the domain of its robotic control software from the deep sea to deep space. Seattle Angel Fund led the latest funding round with participation from Seattle's Alliance of Angels. Seattle-based BluHaptics, which spun out of the University of Washington in 2013, builds software to improve communication between pilots and remotely operated vehicles underwater. Since its launch, the company has received more than $1 million in government grants. CEO Don Pickering told GeekWire that his company has begun onboarding early customers, and recently did a test \"with a major oil and gas company.\" Pickering said the test went well. \"We are getting almost unanimous positive response on the software,\" he said. BluHaptics is also looking at where it can take its software next, with its next move being literally out of this world. Pickering said BluHaptics is using some of the new money to expand into the space robotics market. \"We're getting strong interest in space applications for running robots remotely in space as well as terrestrial applications, including service robots and even aerial drones, of all things,\" Pickering said. \"Robots do really well in a factory environment, where everything can be programmed with a high degree of accuracy because everything is known. But when you take a robot into the field or use it remotely, it becomes incredibly challenging.\" That's where BluHaptics comes in. Their devices use force-feedback control systems and 3-D displays to let customers control robots more easily and efficiently. The software can be used with oil rigs, excavation tools -and soon, with satellites and drones. Pickering said the company, which currently has six full-time and two part-time employees, is continually applying for patents. BluHaptics was awarded two patents last fall, and another four are pending. The company's application for underwater manipulator arms will release in June. \"We are as excited about the management team they have put in place as we are about their groundbreaking technology,\" Seattle Angel Fund's Susan Preston said in a statement. \"We believe BluHaptics is well poised to transform the telerobotics market.\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Giri Sreenivas and Dirk Sigurdson. Photos via Privacy Labs.\n Giri Sreenivas and Dirk Sigurdson already launched and sold one security company. Now they've raised a sizable seed investment round from top venture firms for another security-related startup. The Seattle-area entrepreneurs today announced a $4 million seed round led by Instacart and Coinbase investor Initialized Capital, with participation from Lemnos Labs, Liquid 2 Ventures, CrunchFund, and Fuel Capital. Angel investors Steve Jang, Lee Linden, and Geoff Entress also invested. The new Bellevue, Wash.-based company is called Privacy Labs. The co-founders are staying quiet in regard to details about what exactly they are building and the technology that powers the product. But the general idea is to help everyday users \"take control of their data\" and to \"decentralize\" the internet. \"We are excited to bring our unique mix of experiences developing security products and consumer products to bear on the most important and challenging consumer privacy and security problems we all face today,\" Sreenivas told GeekWire. Here's a bit more from the company's press release: As mobile device usage has exploded, consumers have wanted ease and access to their data at their fingertips. Technology companies defaulted to centralized services running in the cloud as the easiest way to meet this need. As a result, consumers have unknowingly traded the privacy and security of their data for access to these free services. Subsequent leaks and reporting have made it clear that entrusting third parties with sensitive personal data opens consumers to the risk of hacking and government surveillance overreach. Here's a description from the company's website: Our purpose is to help people be free, private and secure online. The last two major computing revolutions brought us desktops on every desk and a mobile phone in every pocket. We are on the verge of a new computing revolution - one that puts the user and their data first by decentralizing the net. This will require new approaches to user experiences, design, marketing, engineering and delivering products to users. We are building the foundation for this transformation. There are also some other clues that point to what Privacy Labs is building. The company created an open source project this past June called Project Oasis, which allows users to \"reclaim their email from centralized services like Gmail and store their data on hardware they own.\" From the Project Oasis GitHub page: Oasis automates the setup of a Raspberry Pi email server meant to run from inside your home. In the home environment, ISPs and user equipment can make it difficult to externally reach home-based email servers due to port blocking. Also, in most cases it's expensive to obtain a static IP address which is necessary to successfully run a mail server. To work around these issues Oasis provisions a cloud-based component that acts as a gateway to your home-based Raspberry Pi server. This cloud component is stateless and all data received is immediately forwarded to your pi for safe storage. In October, the founders showed off their \"personal email server\" at a Maker Faire event in Oakland. \"Unsurprisingly, many people made references to Hillary Clinton's private email server,\" Sigurdson wrote in a blog post that has since been taken down. \"It's not a coincidence that someone concerned with their privacy would have an email solution that is similar to what we're providing. It's the best way to ensure that you maintain control of your personal data. She hired IT consultants and spent thousands of dollars for her solution. We are focused on delivering a secure, simple and easy to use product that is accessible to everyone.\" Sreenivas and Sigurdson previously co-founded Mobilisafe, a Seattle mobile device security startup that raised investment from Madrona Venture Group, Trilogy Equity Partners, and T-Mobile's venture arm before it was acquired by Boston-based Rapid7 in 2012. They also worked together at T-Mobile as mobile software architects prior to launching Mobilsafe. Sreenivas, a Stanford grad, also spent more than three years as a software engineer at Lockheed Martin. Sigurdson, a Harvard grad, worked at Wave Systems for nearly eight years before joining T-Mobile. The co-founders plan to use the fresh funding to bring on another eight or so employees. As a result of the new funding, Initialized Capital Managing Partner Garry Tan is joining the board. \"As engineers, designers, and product makers, we have a duty to create secure, private, and easy to use ways for people to communicate, store all their information, and own it completely,\" Tan said in a statement. \"Technology cost curves, the rise of very powerful open source, and the core product/engineering expertise of the Privacy Labs team means we have a chance to create a world where free citizens have exactly that.\" ",

He and his daughter were visiting his brother, David Tobias, and his six-year-old in Los Angeles when the lightbulb went off. They were wandering around a densely-wooded upper-class suburb and the girls were delighting in the surrounding trees. The foursome then purchased and planted some trees of their own -- and they decided not to let the family fun stop there. Martin and David, wistful for the days when they worked side-by-side leading the Seattle daily deals startup Tippr, decided to launch a non-profit that uses tech to encourage reforestation around the world. Today, that idea comes to fruition with the launch of ReTree. \"When David and I put our brains together and said, 'What do the two of us do really well?' One was create compelling shopping experiences, which we had done when we were at Tippr, and the second is to create compelling technology that moves things forward,\" said Martin Tobias in an interview with GeekWire. Through the ReTree website, individual donors can purchase a tree for $1 and select one of 30 countries where it will be planted. The non-profit says that the \"donor-assisted reforestation\" program will help battle climate change and air pollution, which it describes as a \"formidable public health crisis\" that leads to about 6.5 million deaths each year. ReTree is also licensing its technology to e-commerce companies so they can add optional tree-planting donations to their checkout process. \"What we have is a platform that allows an e-commerce retailer to integrate with the 30 countries and 70 partners that we have on our platform so the integration to add trees into your existing e-commerce platform is easier -- plug-and-play -- and is also broader because we've set up all the relationships for you,\" said Tobias. ReTree is a passion project for Tobias, who has three decades working for Seattle tech giants like Microsoft, building startups, and investing in other ventures. He's perhaps best-known as the founder of Loudeye Technologies, a dot-com era digital music service that eventually fell on hard times and sold to Nokia. In 2004, Tobias led a biodiesel operation called Imperium Renewables, which raised massive amounts of funding and then sold to Renewable Energy Corp in 2015. After the acquisition, Tobias made some strategic investments in the cannabis industry but he says he's currently divesting those interests. \"One of the things I've done a couple times is try to be early in what I think are really big markets,\" he said. \"When I was in digital media and started Loudeye, I was very early in digital media. In biodiesel, I was early in biodiesel and I knew that there was going to be a lot of change coming there. I was early into cannabis, but what was different about biodiesel and digital media is I was, personally, very passionate about those products.\" When it comes to cannabis, Tobias's heart just isn't in it. \"I prefer bourbon,\" he jokes. Speaking of bourbon, ReTree is auctioning off a rare 1980 Old fashioned Copper Bourbon from Buffalo Trace to get some initial traction for the business. Proceeds will go toward planting trees and bringing on some staff to build out the non-profit operation. \"I'm super excited to be involved in something that's not just about making money and it's something that I can be involved with my kids doing, as well,\" said Tobias. \"So is my brother, David. I'm very excited to be working, again, with my brother.\" ",

(AppZocial Photos)\n AppZocial, a Seattle startup that builds native apps for \"trusted communities,\" like alumni groups, churches, and non-profits, just secured $1 million in angel financing. The majority of the cash will support a new partnership with Blackbaud, a South Carolina-based company that makes software for the kinds of groups AppZocial already caters to. Under the agreement, AppZocial will build native apps for Blackbaud customers and data from those apps will be integrated into the Blackbaud CRM. \"Blackbaud's a pure integration and distribution space for us,\" said AppZocial CEO James Sun. \"They're the gorilla of that industry and so if they say that this is a good solution, what tends to happen is all these organizations listen to them.\" Sun is a University of Washington grad and serial entrepreneur. Before AppZocial, he founded restaurant deals startup Pirq and led it through an acquisition by iPayment in 2014. But Sun is probably best-known as a finalist on President Trump's former reality show \"The Apprentice.\" While he was running Pirq, Sun invested in a seed round for Anomo, a dating app founded by Ben Liu. It proved to be a promising business relationship; the two went on to co-found AppZocial together. AppZocial employs 11 out of its downtown Seattle headquarters. The startup will still continue building custom apps for clients outside the Blackbaud network. Sun declined to name the angel investor backing the new company. \"Overall it's the trend that mobile apps have been very, very prevalent for consumers and so the consumer expectation of their experience is extremely high because they're used to Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter,\" said Sun. \"A lot of these traditional organizations, like higher ed, non-profits, associations, they don't have the budget, nor do they have the experience, to deliver consumer-expected experiences that are at the high level that's out there today. That's one of the things that's driving our business.\" ",

      "content": "Seattle has become known as one of the nation's hubs for technology, but the Emerald City isn't the only region with growing tech companies in the Pacific Northwest. Powered by new money, startups in Portland and Vancouver, B.C., as well as Seattle, are making big moves. Key new executives, hiring pushes, high-profile partnerships and new headquarters helped a variety of companies move up the GeekWire 200 list of privately-held Pacific Northwest startups this month. The top five remained static in February with DocuSign at the top, followed by Redfin, Avalara, Blue Origin and Puppet. Bellevue-based project management company Smartsheet was the only company in the top 10 with upward movement, climbing two spots to number eight on the list. Click for the full February update to the GeekWire 200 and continue reading for highlights. Seattle startup Apptentive in November raised $3.6 million, helping propel it 11 spots on the list to number 121. At the time, the company, which helps mobile app makers retain customers and boost reviews, said the fresh cash would help grow the its headcount from 30 to 55 over the next year. Apptentive's SDK helps clients like Nordstrom, eBay, Zillow, Microsoft, Sonic, Major League Soccer, IHG, Viacom, power in-app surveys and rating/review prompts. The company, which graduated from Techstars Seattle in 2012, has said it powers more than 25 million in-app customers interactions each month. Whitepages spinout Hiya has been racking up some big wins lately, and that has helped the Seattle startup climb higher on the GeekWire 200, landing at number 136, up 13 spots from last month. Earlier this month the company landed a deal with China-based ZTE to integrate its caller ID and spam detection software directly into the $399 Axon 7 smartphone. That followed the release of an iOS app in September and a deal with Samsung to pre-install Hiya's software on the Note 7 and other devices, though that feature is only available on unlocked phones for U.S. consumers. Hiya is entirely on mobile -- its popular app was previously called Whitepages Caller ID -- and has a worldwide footprint in nearly 200 countries with more than 1.5 billion unique numbers in its global database. The company says it scans 3.5 billion calls and texts per month. LoginRadius, which helps enterprises manage customer identity and access, moved to downtown Vancouver, B.C. in September from Edmonton, Alberta and climbed 12 spots on the GeekWire 200 list to number 101. The company recently reported 257 percent growth in its platform, which encompasses more than 650 million monthly unique users. After recently growing its headcount by 110 percent, LoginRadius is promising a slew of new products in 2017. Portland-based Cozy landed an $8.4 million funding round in August and has since grown rapdily. The property management startup's LinkedIn employee count sits at 46, a big jump from the 25 people the company said it employed when it raised money last summer. One of the key hires was Brian Ellin, formerly of Twitter and Medium, who the company brought in as vice president of product in January. All these moves helped Cozy rise 17 spots on the list to number 142. Cozy, which originally launched in San Francisco but relocated its headquarters to Portland in 2013 because it was easier to hire engineers, now manages more than 100,000 properties in 13,000 cities across the U.S. Here are some of the other big movers on the GeekWire 200 in February: Nine startups made their debut on the GeekWire 200 in February. They are: Spaceflight Industries, Stay Alfred, globys, Highspot, resin.io, StudentRND, DefenseStorm, Viar and Manzama. Some companies jumped more than 20 spots this month, as we some fixed technical issues on the GeekWire 200. Their current spots in the rankings are reflective of where they should have been rather than an actual jump between January and February. They are: Carena, up 26 spots to number 81; Maana, up 29 spots to number 116; and Qorus, up 15 spots to number 123. The GeekWire 200 -- sponsored by our partners at EY -- is derived from our broader list of more than 900 Pacific Northwest tech startups. The list is designed to provide a better understanding of the startup landscape in the Northwest. The ranking is generated from publicly available data, including social media followings, approximate employee counts and inbound web links. To make sure your startup is eligible for inclusion in the GeekWire 200, first make sure it's included in the broader Startup List. If so, there's no need to submit it separately for the GeekWire 200. If your Pacific Northwest startup isn't among the companies on that larger list, you can submit it for inclusion here, and our algorithm will crunch the numbers to see if your company makes next month's GeekWire 200.

Outdoor Project today announced a $2 million Series A round led by Oregon Angel Fund, with participation from Cascade Angels and other individual investors. The 4-year-old company will use the money to expand its resource of \"human-powered outdoor activities\" nationwide and into Canada.  Outdoor Project is somewhat like TripAdvisor, but catered toward those looking for activities to do outside. Each \"experience\" features photos and \"adventure descriptions\" written by the site's contributors, along with information related to location, weather, pros and cons, and more. \"Closing this funding round is tremendous validation for the quality work our contributors and team put into building the world's greatest outdoor adventure guidebook,\" Outdoor Project CEO Tyson Gillard said in a statement. \"Great media, detailed maps and inspiring, complete content is a key piece to support an ever-growing movement for people, largely millennials and young families, to get outside.\" Here's a bit more about the company's formation, via its website: Outdoor Project was created in 2013 to address an increasingly chaotic and time-consuming chore: planning outdoor adventures. The phenomenal efforts of talented storytellers and outdoor experts were real, but outdoor enthusiasts looking to tap into those incredible stories were forced to wade through a discouraging number of resources to find information and inspiration for their next adventure. The 11-person company, an alum of the Portland Incubator Experiment, will also use the new investment to hire another five employees and add more active contributors -- there are nearly 200 -- who provide content for the platform. Outdoor Project, which sells advertising on the site, also publishes educational content and helps support non-profit groups at OutdoorProject.org. Total funding to date is $2.3 million. ",

      "content": "Innovega's eMaccula system uses contact lenses to help wearers' eyes focus on small screens mounted on the glasses lens. (Innovega Photo)\n The startup journey is often a sprint, a mad dash to raise capital and release products. But augmented reality startup Innovega is betting that slow and steady will win the race. The company generated a lot of buzz a few years ago around its augmented reality (AR) glasses and contact lens system eMacula -- previously called iOptik -- which has been in development since 2008. But for the past three years, Innovega has been flying under the radar as it quietly raises capital and prepares for eMacula's commercial launch. Innovega co-founder and CEO Steve Willey tells GeekWire that the startup just closed a funding round of about $3 million led by Chinese digital media giant Tencent, parent company of the popular social media platform WeChat. Former Tencent CTO Jeff Xiong also serves on Innovega's board, and Willey said China will be an important market for eMacula. This is the first private funding the startup has sought, having previously received funds from DARPA, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health. It brings Innovega's total funding to about $10 million, Willey said. He also said eMacula has completed necessary clinical trials and is pending review by the FDA. Because the system involves a contact lens, it must be approved before the startup can begin commercializing it.  As Willey explains, the company has been playing the long game because it is pushing for an augmented reality system unlike any on the market. \"The consumer's got an extremely demanding specification, and we took that as something we needed to meet,\" Willey said. In other words, the company asked: how can we develop an AR device with good optics that is also lightweight, comfortable, looks cool, and don't run out of battery constantly? Innovega's answer was a tiny screen and an even smaller lens. Here's how it works: a one-square-inch screen is attached to the inside of a pair of glasses, sitting about half an inch from the wearer's face. At that distance, our eyes can't naturally focus on the screen. So Innovega developed a high-powered contact lens that adjusts the wearer's vision so she can focus on objects extremely close to her face.  This high-powered lens also corrects vision like a normal contact lens and can be worn with or without AR glasses. The versatility of the system means it could also be used to view media projected directly onto the lenses of glasses, Willey said. He said the company is focusing on the platform's hardware, and will work with other groups to link it to various media sources, such as smartphones. This means eMacula could be used in a variety of settings, including in the military. The startup actually began work on the system by winning a bid from DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. \"We did work in the defense community because they had a very similar problem,\" Willey said. \"They said, 'we've got these so-called War Fighters, and they're wearing these Oakley-style field glasses. And we've got media galore from satellites and cameras and drones, but how do we get it to the troops in the field?' \" Although the startup has since parted ways with DARPA to pursue a commercial product, Willey said there was the possibility the military could use an adapted version of the eMacula system after it has been launched commercially. He also said the high-powered contact lenses could be used in a medical setting, to correct vision in certain patients. Innovega was founded in 2008 by Willey, optometrist Dr. Jerome Legerton, now the company's Chief Clinical and Regulatory Officer, and Randall Sprague, who has since left the company. The startup's headquarters are in Bellevue, Wash., with two manufacturing facilities in California and about 10 employees spread between the two states. ",

The cash will go toward Utrip's machine learning and data science operations, which fuel the platform's recommendation engine. \"One of the things that our travelers love about Utrip is the depth with which we curate destinations and go beyond those top 10 lists that are available everywhere to offer experiences that are really unique and local and authentic for that destination,\" said Utrip CEO Gilad Berenstein. \"That's one big priority, continuing to build out our machine learning capabilities as well as our human expert network, our chefs, artists, historians, etcetera.\" Utrip also plans to grow its team by about a third this year, primarily focusing on sales and marketing. The startup currently employs 18 in Seattle. Utrip's itinerary-planning tools are free for consumers. The startup makes money by licensing its software and building products for businesses in the hospitality space, like hotels and cruise lines. \"All of our partners -- be it small or big, be it hotel or cruise line, airline, etcetera -- are interested in offering personalized experiences and recommendations their potential guests,\" said Berenstein. \"So, ultimately, this goes all the way from making great recommendations and itineraries on their sites to doing personalized email marketing and personalized social media promotion where they can show the right recommendation, the right experience, to the right traveler.\" Berenstein and his family moved to the U.S. from Israel when he was a child. As an immigrant entrepreneur and the founder of a travel-based business, he has a few thoughts on the crush of immigration-related news from the past few weeks. \"I'm a believer in immigration and I'm a believer in open borders and I think that travel ... it's this really beautiful, eye-opening experience,\" he said. \"When people travel they get to see the world and we all get to remember that our perspective is not the only perspective and that our way of life is not the only way of life.

      "content": "Chris Barrow speaks at the 2015 EY Entrepreneur of the Year awards (GeekWire)\n When Bothell, Wash.-based EagleView Technology Corp. was acquired in 2015, EagleView CEO Chris Barrow wasn't sure what he would do next. He planned to move on from EagleView -- a powerhouse in aerial imagery and analytics -- but he didn't know where to invest his time. Ultimately, investment opportunities ended up being what he stuck with. Last month, Barrow and EagleView's former CFO John Polchin launched the $150 million venture capital fund Imagen Capital Partners with a $5 million investment in Vioguard, the Bothell company that makes a self-sanitizing keyboard. Imagen will focus on emerging software and hardware companies in the Seattle area and other U.S. technology hubs. GeekWire spoke with Barrow about how he and Polchin went from running a company to investing in others, and where we can expect to see Imagen invest next. Continue reading for edited excerpts. GeekWire: Why did you decide to start a venture capital firm? Chris Barrow: I was fortunate because I had been successful in the exit of EagleView and was now in a financial position where I could kind of pick and choose what I wanted to do next. I kept getting a bunch of calls from people saying, \"What are you doing next, Chris? Are you going to go run another company? Are you going to be a CEO again? What are you thinking about?\" I looked at that pretty seriously. I had a number of opportunities -- companies that had reached out to me -- folks that I had talked to about maybe going and running another business. But I also was in a position where I could start investing in some companies and I did so. I started investing in some businesses - little angel investments here and there. I was sitting on a couple of private company boards and I found that I really enjoyed that. I really enjoyed working with some of these small companies. I enjoyed the startup phase. What was interesting to me was, it was very diverse. I was talking to a lot of different companies and evaluating a lot of companies, and I really enjoyed doing that. At the same time, I was getting a lot of calls from people who were former EagleView investors who had said, \"Hey Chris, what are you doing now?\" I said, \"Well, I'm just investing in this company here and investing in that company.\" These folks would say, \"Can we invest with you?\" My response was, \"Well sure, let me send you the company's information and let me tell you about it.\" I had several of them say \"Well Chris, we don't really want to see the information we just want to know if you're investing in it we'd like to invest alongside you.\" That was an interesting light-bulb moment because I thought, if I'm going to invest my own capital that's one thing. If now I'm going to be investing other people's capital that's a whole 'nother ball game. So, if I were to do that, what would be the best way to do that and how would I do that? I went and talked to some folks I know very well and asked them that same question -- If I was going to be investing other people's money in addition to my own what would the best structure be? -- and the answer was, well, it kind of depends on what you do. It depends on how much you're investing and how much capital you have. So, I called some of those folks back and said, \"If we were to do this for real, if we were to start investing, would you be willing to commit a certain amount of capital?\" I was able to, within a few phone calls, get $150 million committed in capital to be able to go invest. At that point, I knew that I had the desire, I knew that I had the capital, and then I went to look at what the best structure was. It turns out the venture structure is a pretty well-established formula for how to make investments. So that's what we did. We formed an investment firm, a venture capital firm, called Imagen Capital Partners and we were kind of off to the races. That was sort of the genesis of how the company started. The rest of the story was, I recognized that I'm not the smartest guy out there. I certainly have areas that I think are personal strengths and I certainly have areas that are not strengths of mine. I'm painfully aware of what most of those are and I recognized that I really needed a partner with me that had strengths that I didn't have. So, I reached out to my former CFO at EagleView, John Polchin, and asked if he would be interested in joining me as a partner in the firm and he was. I was really excited to be able to bring John in as a partner at Imagen to help grow this and help make this a successful entity. GeekWire: So how is Imagen different than other funds? We don't have very many LPs [limited partners]. We have a very, very small group, less than a handful. Because of that, we don't have some of the same constraints about the timing of deals. It allows us to be more selective in terms of the companies that we do. We don't feel like there's a certain number of deals that we have to invest in. As I look at a lot of other venture capital companies out there, a lot of them like to really tout that they're doing X number of deals and so forth, and that's not us. We're really about being very selective about picking the right companies. We also feel like we're not typical venture guys, we don't come from that space. We've run companies and we've run companies very recently. Just a few months ago we were CEO and CFO of a successful technology company in the Seattle area, so we feel like we've got some good, solid recent experience about what operational issues some of these small companies are going to face. We're small and we're very well funded. So we've got a sizable fund for the size of firm that we are and we're strict business operators. We look at things from an operational standpoint. A lot of other companies out there probably say the same things and do similar things. I just know that I met with a lot of them when I was at EagleView - we met with a lot of different investment companies and venture companies. I feel like we're different from most of the ones we met with, just because we have such a strong operational background. GeekWire: Can you talk a bit more about what sectors you're interested in investing in? Barrow: We definitely came up with an investment thesis when we put this together, and the investment thesis is really all about technology companies - mostly software companies. We love the SaaS space, so highly recurring revenue, low capex kind of business. But we're also really intrigued by some of the other sort of technology related areas. Our first investment was actually at a hardware company and you guys covered it - a company in Bothell called Vioguard. And we've also been looking at companies that are sort of in the technology-enabled services space. I think, maybe one thing that makes us a little different, is we don't really have such a strict thesis as far as the exact kind of companies we're investing in. We're trying to be very opportunistic and find great companies and great teams, but also companies that we think we can help. There's some companies that quite frankly we come away and say they're probably better served by a more traditional venture firm. I don't know that there's necessarily a lot of value we can bring to the company. So we know what are strengths are from an operational standpoint and, to the extent that we can find companies that we can provide more than just money, those are the companies that we're most interested in talking to. GeekWire: How do you choose how much to invest? Barrow: We're opportunistic, I think we sort of see, based on the size of our fund and our ability to manage the number of deals in our portfolio we probably see sizes somewhere between that $2 and $12 million is kind of a sweet spot for us. But we wouldn't be strict about that. If we found the right company we would certainly vary from that, but at least that's our initial target right now. GeekWire: What about the Seattle startup market seemed like a good opportunity? Barrow: We love the marketplace. We're from Seattle, we built a successful business in Seattle. So, we think that Seattle is probably an undercapitalized market in terms of some of the great technologies and ideas that come out of Seattle. We think that this is definitely an area we will be focusing on. There are also some other areas in the country that we tend to like. I really like the Utah Valley area - I think that there's a lot of really exciting technology companies coming out of that marketplace and not as many firms focusing on those. There's some other cities we love too. We love Los Angeles and Austin as technology hubs that we think probably don't get as much attention from capital markets. So we're definitely looking at those marketplaces, with Seattle, of course, being right now on top of our list. ",

      "content": "(BigStock Photo)\n Xiao Wang is an immigrant success story. He came to the U.S. from Nanjing at three and went on to earn advanced degrees from Stanford and Harvard Business School before jumping into leadership roles in tech. For the past three years, he's been a senior product manager on Amazon Go, the Seattle retailer's ambitious new convenience store operation. Now Wang is working to ensure immigrants, like himself, have access to the same opportunities. This month, Wang left his role at Amazon to co-found and run Boundless, a spinout of Seattle-based startup studio Pioneer Square Labs. The startup is in stealth mode and Wang and Pioneer Square Labs aren't saying much, but its website pledges to \"provide the tools, community, and personalized support applicants need to take charge of their immigration journey.\" In today's charged political climate where President Donald Trump has sparked fears with his immigration policy, Boundless sees an opening to create a successful business. The startup will initially focus on bringing dispersed immigrant families together in the U.S., according to a Facebook post by Pioneer Square Labs co-founder Ben Gilbert. It aims to be a resource for immigrants trying to navigate America's tumultuous political climate and those facing financial barriers to obtaining a visa or green card. The process can be laborious and families often have to shell out thousands of dollars for immigration attorneys. \"We believe there is a better way,\" writes Wang in an essay on Boundless's website. \"Technology can process and synthesize the vast amount of information better than the best human expert, faster, clearer, and at a much lower cost. With these tools, we can empower every current or future immigrant with the information, guidance, and support they need to confidently take control of their journey.\" Pioneer Square Labs has a unique model for quickly testing and validating new startup ideas before bringing in an executive team to spin them out. The studio, co-founded by Greg Gottesman, Geoff Entress, Mike Galgon, and Gilbert, recently moved to a new building adjacent to the Impact HUB downtown. Before Boundless, PSL spun out sales tax reporting startup LumaTax, an advertisement monitoring company called Ad Lightning, and JetClosing, which digitally streamlines the real estate purchasing process. Boundless is the startup studio's fourth spinout and the timing is no accident. The startup's website addresses President Trump's executive orders and his administration's attitude toward immigration head on: Most executive orders are not self-executing. It is possible for a President to order some changes that take effect immediately, as we have seen. Most elements of an executive order, however, direct a federal agency to undertake new and time-consuming efforts -- issuing a new regulation, for example, or forming a commission to make new policy recommendations. Such actions typically take years to play out ... No President has the last word on immigration. Although our laws tend to give the executive branch wide discretion in carrying out immigration policy, Congress has the power to rewrite these laws. Judges will block or overturn those actions deemed outside the bounds of Congressional intent or the Constitution. State and local governments will make decisions about how they want to treat immigrant issues within their own borders. Boundless's website includes resources, including information about President Trump's executive order on immigration, which is currently stalled by federal court rulings. On Thursday, Trump announced he will not further appeal the executive order. Instead, he plans to issue a revised version next week. The uncertainty surrounding U.S. immigration policy is sending shockwaves of anxiety through the tech community, which relies on a diverse talent pool for a number of reasons. \"This is a big and complex challenge, and we are excited to take it on,\" Wang writes on Boundless's website. \"Twenty-eight years ago, my parents gave up everything so that I can have the opportunities I have today. And now, we have the privilege and obligation to help as many others as possible achieve their own dreams.\" ",

Soundtrack Your Brand today announced a $22 million round led by Industrifonden and Balderton Capital. The Stockholm-based company will use the fresh cash to grow its platform across the globe -- including in the Seattle region, where it opened a sales office this past May and employs eight people. Founded in 2013 by music industry vets Ola Sars and Andreas Liffgarden, Soundtrack Your Brand aims to create \"the first truly modern streaming service for businesses.\" Traditionally, many businesses play background music with CDs or satellite feeds, and some never report what they play to rights holders. Soundtrack Your Brand offers a platform that utilizes consumer insights and data analytics to provide brand-centric playlists with licensed music. It is now active in more than 100 countries worldwide and saw its revenue and user base grow by nearly 400 percent over the past year. \"Background music today is sold as a utility, and there's rarely much thought going into what music brands are playing and why,\" Liffgarden said in a statement. \"Today's background music sucks for brands and consumers alike, and it's hurting the music industry at large. As lovers of music and technology, we're completely overhauling this industry, to once and for all kill bad background music.\" Before launching the company, Sars helped start Beats Music (acquired by Apple for $3 billion) while Liffgarden led Spotify's business development team. Soundtrack Your Brand is based in Stockholm -- where consumer music streaming giant Spotify, an early investor in the startup, also has its HQ -- but expanded its footprint across the pond last year to Seattle. Jody McKinley, Soundtrack Your Brand's managing director of North America, told GeekWire that the company picked Seattle for its North American home base because of the region's talent. It plans to add another four employees to the office this year. \"We were drawn to the concentration of talent in the area -- from licensing, music curators, sales, operations and tech -- that bridges commercial and consumer subscription services and is extremely valuable to a business like ours,\" he said. Soundtrack Your Brand employs 65 people in total, with its main engineering team based Stockholm and an additional sales team in London. Total funding for the company is now more than $40 million. As a result of the new funding, Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen, previously head of mobile for Uber and Dropbox, is joining the board, along with Industrifonden investment manager and music entrepreneur Johan Englund.

      "content": "After a decade of strong growth, employment in Washington state's life science industry is decreasing. (Washington Life Science & Global Health Advisory Council Image)\n Washington state is a leader in many areas of science, technology, and innovation. But over the past few years, the state's life science industry -- once among its strongest -- has begun to languish. A new report commissioned by the Washington Life Science & Global Health Advisory Council shows that the industry lost 3 percent of its jobs between 2011 and 2014 in the state. In a contrast, the national life science industry saw job growth of 2.7 percent in the same time period. The new job data shows a reversal in the trend of strong job growth in the previous decade, which was faster and more dramatic than the nation as a whole and fared well during two economic crises. It's also a stark contrast to the skyrocketing growth of employment in Washington's technology industry. The report blames this downturn on an erosion of state programs meant to support the life sciences industry, including the end of the state's research and development tax credit and the elimination of multiple state funding programs. The advisory council, which was established in 2015 by Gov. Jay Inslee to address concerns that the industry was falling behind, presented the report to the governor today as part of a bid to revive those state programs and reinvigorate the industry. One of the clearest examples of this erosion is the closing of the Life Sciences Discovery Fund (LSDF), a state-run fund which gave research grants to early stage startups, nonprofits and research institutions. Leen Kawas, CEO of Seattle-based M3 Biotechnology and a member of the advisory council, told GeekWire that the financial assistance and connections she made through the fund made her entrepreneurial journey possible. \"Probably M3 would have not been here if we didn't get the funding from the state, and also the support for the community,\" she said. M3 was one of the last groups to be funded before the fund was closed abruptly in June of 2015. \"We were also being asked to move to California,\" and if the company had gotten off the ground without the LSDF, it likely would have relocated to San Diego, Kawas said. \"It was a great tool for me as an entrepreneur, and I feel that we need to empower our entrepreneurs to build life science companies,\" she said. \"It's not only creating revenue for the state, but potentially we could be changing and improving the quality of life for a lot of people.\" The life science industry does indeed have major repercussions beyond corporate and government balance sheets. Washington is recognized as one of the leaders in life sciences research, and work at institutions like the University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center is advancing cutting-edge therapies for cancer, Alzheimer's, HIV and more. But the state is struggling to translate that leading research into a thriving industry. Leslie Alexandre, CEO of industry group Life Science Washington and a member of the governor's advisory council, told GeekWire that much more could be done to leverage that wealth of research. \"We have this incredible foundation to build upon, that other states dream of. Most other states can't touch what we have in research,\" Alexandre said. The advisory council's most immediate recommendation to fuel growth in the industry is to reinstate a research and development tax credit that the legislature allowed to expire in 2015. Governor Inslee has written that credit into his budget, which is currently being examined by the state Legislature. If the budget is approved, the tax credit would assist companies investing in research and development, often companies who are not yet profitable. The report identifies the tax credit and Washington's business and operation tax as two measures which make it \"one of the most challenging states in the country for life science companies to grow and add manufacturing jobs in the state.\" Other measures endorsed in the report include steps to retain mid-size and high-growth companies, of which the state has very few; assist entrepreneurs by allocating more wet lab space, particularly in urban areas; and attract more investment opportunities, possibly including state-sponsored funds like the LSDF. The report included another notable number: for every job created directly by the life science industry, 3.8 additional jobs were created across the state. Life science jobs also fared well during recent periods of economic difficulty, including the great recession in 2007 and 2008. The industry fared better than Washington as a whole during those economic crises, with respects to job retention. ",

      "content": "The Faira team. Photo via Faira.\n Faira is raising more cash to help build out its real estate platform and expand to the San Francisco market. The Seattle-area startup today announced a $1.2 million investment from Mark Hager and Himel Capital, which has backed companies like Uber, Vroom, and others. Angel investors Amit Mital, a backer of Zillow, Redfin, and OfferUp, and R. Ravi, a professor at the Carnegie Mellon Tepper School of Business, also participated in the round. Founded in 2015, Faira wants to reduce complication and increase transparency for those that are buying and selling a home. It does this by conducting inspections before a house goes to market, providing information like seller disclosures, and utilizing technology to create a more efficient negotiation process online. Faira is free to use for sellers; it makes money by charging a 0.5 percent platform fee to homebuyers. The startup also helps sellers eliminate agent commission fees by providing services like an MLS listing, inspection reports, professional photos, and syndication on sites like Zillow and Redfin. The company says it helps sellers save $20,000 on average; homes listed on Faira typically stay on the market for 12 days.  Faira has several competitors that also offer alternatives to the traditional real estate agent commission model like OfferPad, OpenDoor, Knock, and GoldenKey. But Faira says it takes a different approach. \"Faira enables sellers to get the best price for their home for two reasons,\" explained Faira CEO Kamal Jain. \"There is social proof in the transparent offer process, which gives buyers confidence. Faira also gives agent-less buyers access to the offer process, and therefore more competition. Direct buyers can save 3 percent on the price using Faira without an agent.\" Jain also said competitors have avoided markets like Seattle and San Francisco. The former eBay distinguished research scientist, who founded the company with Eduardo Oliveira and Haresh Sangani, also noted that Faira does not intend to compete with brokers. \"Instead, Faira listings offer full agent commission for buyer's agents and our platform provides essential time-saving features to maximize brokers' efficiency and productivity,\" he said. \"We bring brokers a $100,000-plus monthly commission opportunity.\" On its FAQ page, Faira notes that it is \"not a real estate broker.\" It does, however, offer access to a dedicated agent in exchange for a 1 percent commission. \"We provide the technology platform, transparency reports and marketing services to support your sale,\" the site reads. \"Brokerage services are provided by Faira.com LLC, WA License #19883, and other partner brokers.\" Faira has helped sell homes in urban, suburban, and rural areas across Washington and will now expand operations to the Bay Area market. The 12-person company has raised $2.7 million to date. ",

The partnership was announced Thursday alongside a new $6.5 million Series A funding round, which GeekWire reported on in December. ReplyYes revealed more details about the round today; it was led by Madrona Venture Group, Cross Culture Ventures, Lowercase Capital, Muse Capital, and Arnold Venture Group. ReplyYes, a spinoff of Madrona Venture Labs, will work with Universal to allow artists to use its messaging service to sell tickets, music, and merchandise to fans. This isn't the company's first venture into music. Its first venture, \"The Edit\", offers a way to sell vinyl on the ReplyYes platform. Customers receive daily recommendations for records via texts and can simply reply \"yes\" to purchase, or help the chatbot learn their preferences by responding \"Like\" or \"Dislike.\" If users have more complex requests or needs, a human agent takes over to help. Since launching 18 months ago, The Edit has sold more than 100,000 albums. \"The ReplyYes mission is to help people discover and purchase the things that they love,\" ReplyYes CEO Dave Cotter said in a statement. \"Our platform enables brands to engage and transact with their customers where they increasingly are - on their mobile phones messaging.\" ReplyYes also last year launched its second text-based storefront, Origin Bound, which applies the same approach to graphic novels. Messaging bots, fueled by artificial intelligence and machine learning technology coupled with human assistance, have gained traction in recent years. Facebook launched its own chatbot last year and more than 33,000 businesses currently have Facebook bots. Facebook told Wired in December that about one billion people were interacting with businesses on Messenger each month. Other tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, IBM, and smaller startups like Ozlo are also utilizing AI and machine learning for related chatbot-like products. Peach, another Seattle startup, is using mobile messaging to help improve how workers order lunch. Top retailers Starbucks and Nordstrom are now also starting to roll out their own chatbots. While messaging bots have been slow to gain traction with mainstream consumers, ReplyYes' recent funding round and its partnership with Universal suggest the trend isn't going away anytime soon. \"Our recording artists, songwriters and labels benefit from these exciting new forms of fan engagement and merchandising that are created by conversational commerce,\" Peter Sinclair, Universal's Senior Vice President of Consumer Engagement, said in a statement. \"We are excited to work with ReplyYes, and even more excited for the millions of fans around the world who will experience this new and direct way of interacting with their favorite artists.\" ",

      "content": "Opal Labs CEO Steve Giannani.\n Given its early-stage investments in companies like Facebook, Slack, and Dropbox, if your company raises money from Accel, it's probably a good sign. Opal, a marketing collaboration startup based in Portland, today announced a $15.5 million Series B round led by Accel, the 34-year-old Silicon Valley venture capital firm, along with participation from existing investors Madrona Venture Group, Seven Peaks Ventures, and MMC Ventures. GeekWire reported on the funding back in December, but now we have more details about how Opal will use the fresh cash and the investors involved. Founded in 2011, Opal has quietly built a market-leading company that helps businesses streamline the production of marketing and media campaigns with one central platform and framework. Clients include NASA, Nike, Starbucks, Target, Airbnb, and others. A 2013 graduate of the Portland Seed Fund, Opal bootstrapped in its early days before raising a $2.1 million seed round led by Oregon Angel Fund. In 2014, it raised an $8 million Series A round led by Seattle-based Madrona. Total funding in the company is now $25.6 million. This Series B round marks a pivotal milestone for the company as it looks to establish itself as the top platform of choice for companies that want to streamline their brand marketing process across every consumer touch point. \"We want to accelerate growth and solidify our position as a market leader in this space we feel we are defining,\" Opal CEO Steve Giannini told GeekWire. Giannini stressed the importance of having Accel lead its Series B round, given the firm's investments in other enterprise collaboration software companies like Dropbox, Slack, Atlassian, Invision, Frame.io, and others. \"This notion of collaboration software and helping the way teams work together to get jobs done is a major investment thesis for them,\" he said. \"It aligns perfectly with our thesis and what we want to do.\" Opal will use the fresh cash to double its 75-person workforce by the end of 2017 -- it has 60 employees at its HQ in Portland, with additional offices in New York City and London (a San Francisco outpost will open later this year) -- while continuing to bolster its technology. Opal helps companies put together their brand messages, whether via social media campaigns, physical retail store setups, or other marketing vehicles. Giannini said the software offers a huge improvement over the hodgepodge process traditionally used by marketing teams that include a mix of tools like email, phone, Google Docs, Excel spreadsheets, and more that weren't built specifically with modern day marketers in mind. Opal's top-notch list of clients pay a licensing fee of $100,000 per year, on average, Giannini said. \"Product innovation is our secret sauce,\" he noted. Giannini said he and his co-founders -- \"Chief Founder\" George Huff, David Gorman, and Matt Oxley -- are proud to have built Opal in Portland from Day 1 and to have attracted an investor like Accel to the Pacific Northwest. This is a nice rebound for Portland's startup scene, which did not see much venture capital activity in 2016. Only four Portland-based startups had venture rounds exceeding $15 million last year, according to data from Pitchbook. \"We don't have a super strong venture presence in Portland, but great firms are starting to reach into the city,\" Giannini said. \"The kind of investors we work with really believe in Portland as a place where we can build a capital efficient business. There is a ton of innovation here.\" As part of the new investment round, Accel partner Arun Mathew will join Opal's board of directors. ",

      "content": "Silene Biotech co-founders Alex Jiao, left, and Jenna Strully. (Silene Biotech Photo)\n Silene Biotech wants to help you grow a new heart or liver, in case those organs fail when you get older. The ambitious Seattle startup -- founded two years ago and a member of the 2017 TechStars Seattle class -- today is launching a new service that freezes and stores your white blood cells so they can be used decades later when troubling ailments set in. The big idea? You could preserve the cells from your 23-year-old body for use when you are 65, and possibly facing life-threatening diseases. Founded by four Seattleites, including two former University of Washington researchers, Silene is on the cutting-edge of a new field of regenerative medicine, which rebuilds parts of the body. While growing a new heart with your own cells may be decades off, two of Silene's co-founders, Alex Jiao and Jenna Strully, believe preparing for those medical breakthroughs now could be a huge advantage. Jiao and Strully came up with the idea for Silene after meeting in a science business class at the University of Washington, where Jiao was studying bioengineering and Strully, who is also a medical doctor, was in the MBA program. They competed in the UW's business plan competition and won some initial funding during the process. The startup has raised $450,000 in total from UW grants and awards, angel investments, the founders' own cash and funds from TechStars. Jiao, who is just 28 years old, said he hopes the startup will \"educate and raise awareness and provide a service,\" along with pushing the needle towards personalized medicine, a kind of medicine that tailors treatments to specific individuals. The company was originally named miPS Labs, a nod to its focus on induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology. Unlike most stem cells, which naturally occur in the body, these cells are engineered from an average adult's white blood cells and could be used in regenerative medicine to grow extra tissue or even entire organs. \"The first applications of this regenerative medicine technology are starting to hit clinical trials,\" Jiao said.   But the older we get, the less effectively the process works, he said. Silene Biotech is collecting and storing cells now, so customers can use them years or decades down the line. Part of their plan is a newly-developed collection system. Instead of collecting urine samples, which the startup did in their beta trial, it is now partnering with Bloodworks Northwest to collect samples of customer's blood. Starting Thursday, customers can sign up to have blood drawn at Bloodworks Northwest's downtown Seattle location. Jiao said they will soon also be taking samples at other Bloodworks locations throughout the Northwest. The sample will then be processed by the company and stored in a facility in Indianapolis, far from Seattle's threat of disruptive earthquakes. The service costs $299 for the initial processing and first year of storage, and $50 per year after that. Customers can access their cells at any time, retrieving them to be used in medical procedures. The cells are anonymized during processing to protect patient confidentiality, and customers also retain the right to have the cells destroyed at any time. There's no way to know exactly what these cells could be used for in the future, but early possibilities include growing tissue to repair organs, using lab-grown tissue to test patients for drug resistance, and even growing entire organs for patients who need transplants. To explain the possible uses of these specialized cells, Jiao cited the first clinical trial in which they were studied. In the trial, researchers took skin cells from a patient with vision loss and converted them into lab-grown stem cells. The cells were then grown into retinal cells and implanted in the patient's eye, and halted her vision loss. \"Maybe a decade or so off is when we'll really start seeing the fruits of this research turn into viable therapies that can treat and cure diseases, and maybe a couple more decades until we can regrow entire organs,\" Jiao said. \"We're not going to grow a heart tomorrow,\" he said, but trials are about to begin that aim to growing parts of a heart. While iPS cells are the area of Jiao's expertise, he said the company changed its name because it realized there were many more applications to its service than just iPS cells. Stored white blood cells are being studied as a treatment for Leukemia, for example. But the switch was also inspired by a remarkable story. In 2007, in the Northern reaches of Siberia, Russian scientists dug up a cache of seeds hidden by a squirrel. The seeds were estimated to be 32,000 years old. A few years later, scientists were able to germinate one of the seeds and grow it into an adult plant: the silene stenophylla. That seed is officially the oldest living organism to survive being frozen. Jiao said he hopes Silene Biotech will do a better job than squirrels did 32,000 years ago. We caught up with Silene's founders for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Keep reading for a Q&A with Jiao and Strully, and check out all our Startup Spotlights here. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"We store your younger cells today so you can use them in personalized therapies and diagnostics in the future.\" Inspiration hit us when:  Alex (Jiao) worked on deriving patient stem cells and turning them into heart cells and he realized he could be doing this easily for himself. VC, Angel or Bootstrap: Bootstrap and angels. Need a fair amount of capital to start a lab, now trying to prove the market. Our 'secret sauce' is: Our passion, backgrounds, and our partnerships with UW and BloodworksNW The smartest move we've made so far: Switching to blood and partnering with BloodworksNW The biggest mistake we've made so far: Not moving faster Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: Zuckerberg. Goals are more in line regarding biotech, pretty audacious (Chan + Zuckerberg initiative). Our favorite team-building activity is:  Grabbing snacks or meals (team loves food).

(Startup UW photo)\n A club at the University of Washington is ready to help launch the next big thing. Startup UW is a student-run entrepreneurship group that provides a support network and resources for innovative students. The club's mission is to assist students -- most of whom are undergraduates -- turn their ideas for new products and businesses into a reality. On Friday, Startup UW for the first time hosted 15 entrepreneurial teams from across the West Coast in a collegiate pitch contest called TigerLaunch. Judges for the regional competition selected five winners who will go on to a national contest being held at Princeton University in April. Five of the teams presenting on Friday were from the UW, including one of the winners, SafeFlame, which is working on a technology that turns organic waste into clean-burning cooking fuel. \"Entrepreneurship is alive and well at the UW,\" said Matt Koenig, president of Startup UW, and a junior studying finance.  \"We have kids coming from every department to do this.\" Startup UW was founded about five years ago and has 80 members. The club is affiliated with the university's Foster School of Business and its Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship. About 60 percent of the members are from STEM programs, 30 percent from business and the other 10 percent from a variety of majors including communications, public health and design. Michael Petrochuk, a UW senior in the computer sciences program, joined Startup UW as a freshman and was part of the TigerLaunch competition. Startup UW taught him \"everything I know about entrepreneurship,\" Petrochuk said. His venture is called Wardrobe.tips, an online service that advises male shoppers trying to build a well-chosen professional wardrobe. \"It's so critical to dress well because it affects how people perceive you and your self-confidence,\" Petrochuk said. In addition to SafeFlame, the other winners Friday were Pyur Solutions, a non-toxic pesticide for eliminating fleas, ants, cockroaches and other insect pests; Mecanodontics, an alternative approach to orthodontic braces; Frenzy, a fashion venture; and ConserWater, an app that uses NASA satellite data and weather data to help farmers internationally figure out how much to irrigate their crops. Other competitors included Trusted H2O, a team from the UW that is researching reverse osmosis technology to provide clean drinking water in developing countries; Bulletin Flights, which promotes itself as \"the world's foremost private aviation networking service\"; and Sypht, a team from the University of Oregon, which is working on an app that can quickly scan terms of service and user agreements in search of red flags. Many of the teams had already successfully participated in other pitch events and hackathons, providing some initial resources that helped them get started. Some found support from university programs. UW students have access to UW CoMotion, which has 3D printers and other resources, as well as a business plan practicum offered through the Buerk Center. The resources are out there, Koenig said, \"you have to be scrappy and find a lot of this on your own.\" Aadith Moorthy is a student from Caltech and the founder of ConserWater. If he wins in the finals, he already has plans for the prize money. ConserWater is still early stage, Moorthy said. \"Once we get funding, we plan to increase our marketing operations. Penetration is the hardest for individual, small farmers.\" The judges for the West Coast contest were Greg Gottesman, managing director at Pioneer Square Labs and venture partner at Madrona Venture Group; Karen Mooney, COO at C+C; Marion Desmazieres, tech business developer for Amazon Alexa; Sarah Boden, deputy executive director and COO for Access Services, which administers Los Angeles County's transportation program for the disabled; and Alan Leong, founding advisor for the gene therapy company Sigma Genetics. The teams going to the finals in April will compete for $30,000 in prize money, as well as the opportunity to meet with national venture capital firms. The student entrepreneurs, said Koenig, \"are solving some crazy problems for the world.\" TigerLaunch operates separately from the University of Washington Business Plan Competition, which has awarded $1.2 million in prize money to 139 student companies in the past 18 years. Team registration for that competition is open from March 13 to April 3. ",

The company just reeled in another $300,000 that is part of a larger $2 million convertible note; the startup has raised $1.8 million of the note since June 2016. OneEnergy plans to use the funding for project development and working capital, VP of Operations Jennifer Barnes confirmed on Monday. Recently, OneEnergy developed projects for clients such John Hopkins in Baltimore, where it worked on a project featuring more than 40,000 solar panels on a 97-acre plot. It's developed similar projects in Oregon. The 25-person company raised a $5 million round in October 2014. Bryce Smith and current CEO Bill Eddie cofounded OneEnergy in 2009. OneEnergy was highlighted in this post written in November by Washington-based Climate Solutions, which called for \"unprecedented investment in clean energy and climate adaptation\" given President Trump's energy policies.

(Photos via Sift Science)\n Sift Science, a heavily-funded San Francisco-based company that builds software to fight fraud online, is opening up a Seattle outpost, led by a former Amazon senior manager -- becoming the latest Bay Area startup to open an engineering center in the city. Some big-name customers like Airbnb, Zillow, and OpenTable, use Sift Science to identify bad actors by flagging risky or abusive behaviors before they commit fraud. The software helps e-commerce companies and other online brands reduce chargebacks, fraudulent transactions, and account abuse. Sift Science employs 80 at its headquarters in San Francisco. The Seattle office, opening up in Westlake Tower downtown, will tap the region's developer talent pool to build new products and tools. RELATED CONTENTCheck out GeekWire's list of Seattle-Area Engineering Centers established by out-of-town companies.\"This isn't going to be a satellite office where we throw over bugs or small issues ... Seattle is the birthplace of many tech giants with really hardcore DNA in building first-class technology and businesses and we can't not tap into that,\" said Sift Science Co-founder Fred Sadaghiani in an interview with GeekWire. Sadaghiani has seen that DNA up close. He met his co-founder Jason Tan in 2006 while working at Zillow and shared an office at Amazon with Matt Green, who will lead Sift Science's Seattle office. Green is leaving Amazon after 17 years to build Sift Science's Seattle operation. He says he was happy at Amazon but the opportunity with Sift Science was too good to pass up. \"I like the product, I like the people, and I like the opportunity to build a team solving hard problems,\" Green said. \"The team that I'll be building in Seattle will look, in composition, similar to the one that I had at Amazon. Mostly software engineers but some product management, some research science and I'm really excited about that.\" Sift Science is a graduate of Y Combinator with a whopping $53.6 million in venture funding to date. The company's Seattle expansion is part of a growing trend among Bay Area tech companies, eager to hire engineering talent from a relatively less competitive market. GeekWire is tracking the engineering outposts, which now amount to more than 80 satellite offices. ",

      "content": "The Abett team: Christine Saunders, Mike Hanlon, and Rob LaRubbio. (Abett Photo)\n From advertising to city planning, data powers the modern world. And while businesses are becoming increasingly sophisticated in leveraging data to drive decision-making, individuals don't always have the tools to harness its power. Mike Hanlon and Rob LaRubbio set out to solve that. Together, they launched Abett, a web app that allows users to ask questions and crowdsource answers. Both co-founders have backgrounds in data science and tech. Hanlon was most recently an economics professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. He also happens to be Amazon's seventh employee, working at the Seattle e-commerce giant from 1995 to 2001. LaRubbio led the development of mobile health applications at the Grameen Foundation. He too worked at Amazon in the early days, from 1997 to 2005. \"We wanted to create a company that combined the best aspects of our experience at Amazon and what we enjoyed about global health. Our goal is to empower people to use data to make better decisions, rather than manipulate people's behavior via advertising.\" We caught up with Hanlon for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"If you face a decision and don't know what to do, visit abett.com and share the problem. People will vote, provide suggestions and discuss. You'll get data to empower your decision. Working with the crowd, we can make better decisions together. Inspiration hit us when: \"Inspiration hit us when a family vacation led me to resign from a comfortable academic position. In 2014, I was traveling to Paris to present at an academic forum. My wife suggested we make a family vacation out of it. I searched for airline tickets, but then I realized that trip was a bad idea for us. The flight was long, our kids were young and I had professional commitments to worry about. Upon reflection, we decided that I should go to Paris alone, and later on, we'd take a family trip to the Grand Canyon instead. Paris is preferable to Arizona for lots of people, but the Grand Canyon was right for us given our situation. However, after I searched for those flights to Paris, over the next few months I saw ads for Air France every single time I went online. Those ads were great for Google and Facebook, which were paid to serve them. However, they were not great for me because that was the wrong vacation for my family. Companies have all sorts of data about us, but they don't use it to help us make better decisions. When the flagrancy of that dawned on me, I decided to resign from my academic position and focus on Abett.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"We have self-funded to this point because we could. Maybe that will change someday, but I think only masochists would voluntarily raise outside money when they didn't need it.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Our product enables people to vote on your question, which gives you interesting data. However, we also have a feature that allows people to suggest new answers to your question. The quantitative aspects of it are an improvement over asking questions on social media, and the unbiased nature of the suggestions is an improvement over search engines and services like Yelp. We aspire to build a robust analytical tool to support individuals' decision making. We know a lot about data analysis, and we've done it in lots of settings. We're excited to apply that experience to this problem.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"We decided to create a company together before we identified a product. That's unconventional, but it forced us to think very hard about our vision and brand, and also about the type of organization we wanted to create. Once those fundamental questions were settled, we started the process of building a product that was consistent with our objectives. We think of ourselves as Tableau for individuals. Tableau's products are fantastic at analyzing data you already have in hand. However, given you need data in hand, it's principally a tool for organizations, not individuals. Our service enables individuals to collect data about the problems they face, and thus empowers them to make better decisions.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"We initially assumed everyone was as aware as we are of how data is used by advertisers. That's not the case. Our market research suggests most people are unaware of this issue, and many who are aware casually dismiss it. Our job is to educate people by providing a different model of how their data can be used in their interest.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Early on, executives like Jeff and Bill Gates had lots of people in their corners, and most importantly a lot of great engineers. As much as you'd love to have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner, I'd take those engineers over them any day.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Sharing parenting advice. We all have younger kids, so many of our conversations focus on parenting. We finally thought, 'Man, somebody should build an app to get and share those kinds of insights,' which is what we did. In a sense, our team-building activity led directly to our product.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Maturity and self-awareness. With all due respect to all the 25-year-old geniuses out there, we're interested in connecting with people who are grounded and have delivered over a longer period of time.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out:  \"Read Steve Blank's book, The Startup Owner's Manual. It's better, faster and cheaper than any MBA program.\" ",

      "content": "Closer Mobile CEO and Founder Jeff Warren. (Photo via LinkedIn)\n You've got somewhere to be, but aren't sure what mode of transportation is best. Uber or Lyft might get you there fastest, but surge pricing can be a pain. Are the busses running on time? Should you just drive yourself? A new Seattle startup hopes to answer these questions for you. Closer Mobile, which is developing an app called Migo, just raised $1.5 million of a larger round from top investment firms. Investors include Second Avenue Partners, a Seattle-based firm co-founded by Nick Hanauer, who is listed as a Closer Mobile director; VIA-ID, a European mobility-focused fund; and Wavemaker, a Los Angeles-based early-stage VC firm. The company is still in stealth mode, but told GeekWire on Friday that it is developing a consumer product that does \"real-time search for on-demand transportation.\" Its website reads: \"A whole new way of choosing how to get from A to B.\" GeekWire first spotted the company this past November, when it raised its seed round. Jeff Warren leads the startup as its co-founder and CEO. He was most recently an executive at Expedia, where Warren lead teams working on mobile products, regional marketing, and more. He also spent five years at Motorola, where he was senior director of strategy and business development before departing to launch Mooi, a startup that tried to create an easy way for individuals to share content, news and calendars in a private social network, but shut down one year later. Idealab Founder and CEO Bill Gross is listed as a director. In addition to founding the Pasadena, Calif.-based incubator, Gross is a serial entrepreneur who has been involved in or founded a variety of startups over his career.  Warren was previously an \"entrepreneur in residence\" at Idealab last year. Migos will need to differentiate itself from other apps that have already tried to capitalize on an opportunity largely created by new tech-powered transportation companies like Uber, Lyft, Car2go, and others. Back in 2013, a group of Seattle entrepreneurs launched Red Ride at a Startup Weekend event with a similar pitch: An app that aggregated API data from ride-hailing options and ranked them by estimated time of arrival and price. Once selecting your option, Red Ride would automatically open the selected app, essentially acting as a lead-generation platform for the ride-hailing services. The team, which won first place at the event, explored growth options post-Startup Weekend and even pitched the idea at competition hosted by travel giant Concur. But the app never really took off. \"Ride-sharing providers weren't willing to play yet, and we felt like we were too early,\" Chet Kittleson, who was part of the RedRide team, told GeekWire on Friday. There was a similar company that launched around the same time called Corral Rides, which eventually was blocked from using Uber and Lyft's APIs. Ironically, after the startup pivoted into a carpooling service and rebranded to Hitch, Lyft decided to acquire the company. Another company, Urbanhail, was also blocked from Uber's API last year; that sparked debate over potential violations of antitrust laws and questions about how ride-hailing giants like Uber and Lyft should handle third-party access to their data. There are several others in this space: Ride Guru and Ride Fair, to name a few. Another one, RideScout, launched in 2013, called itself the \"Kayak of transportation,\" and was acquired by Daimler AG last year. There are certainly a lot of people thinking about how technology can help you pick the best transportation options, or help your transportation experience in general. Former Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire, who is heading up a non-profit called Challenge Seattle, told GeekWire last year that she wanted her group to create an app \"that tells you every mode of transportation you can take at any given time from any given location; or an app that lets you pay for any mode of transportation.\" \"By that I mean today, the way I pay my toll on 520 is worthless to get me on the ferry, which is worthless to get me on the bus, which is worthless to catch an Uber,\" she said this past March. \"What if there could be a single app to do that?\" ",

(GeekWire Photo / Clare McGrane)\n It's no secret that wet lab space is hard to come by in Seattle. Small biotech companies often struggle to find appropriate facilities, and retrofitting existing buildings can be incredibly expensive. Nohla Therapeutics has been living that struggle for a year: the small biotech company, spun out of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, originally set up shop in a biotech incubator space a year ago. Chris Shellooe, the company's senior scientist, said they actually had two labs: one for the science itself, and another for administrative offices. Despite huge early successes, including capping $65 million in funding in under a year, the company wasn't able to move into a new home until a few months ago. Their new office, in Seattle's Eastlake neighborhood, has a large lab space and real offices for the admin staff. The new office was officially opened yesterday with a ribbon cutting ceremony, featuring a guest appearance by Gov. Jay Inslee, who has been a strong advocate of Washington's life science industry. \"What you're doing here is the best of Washington state. You know, I've got the best job in the state of Washington -- other than Russel Wilson's anyway -- because I get to meet Washingtonians who are leading the world in so many technological horizons, and this work is about as exciting as anything else that's going on in the state,\" Inslee said at the event. Nohla is developing a cellular technology platform first invented by the company's co-founder and Chief Medical Officer Colleen Delaney. The startup is currently using the platform to pursue more effective and less dangerous stem cell transplants for Leukemia patients, a step that could save the lives of those with advanced or recurring cancer. But, Delaney said, that's just the tip of the iceberg for the platform. It could be used to improve or create a huge variety of therapies for cancer and beyond. \"The fact that you can make this both the most efficient, logistically, but also such a great benefit to patients is just an extraordinary achievement,\" Inslee said.  \"The personal benefits of this are just incredible.\" Inslee has been an advocate for steps that would help Washington's life science industry flourish, like creating more wet lab space in Seattle. He also encouraged Nohla's staff to advocate for legislative measures like the Research and Development tax credit, which would give tax breaks to life science companies as they invest in R&D. That tax credit expired in 2015, and is up for review to be reinstated. For now, Nohla is already outgrowing its new office, and looking to expand even more as it continues to develop its technology. Check out the images below to get a look inside the new lab. Governor Inslee's interest in life sciences goes beyond jobs and income -- he was also excited about the science behind Nohla's technology. As Delaney showed him one piece of equipment, above, he pointed out the simple controls and joked, \"It's governor proof!\" The opening featured another special guest: Gregg Gordon was the thirteenth patient to have a stem cell transplant using Nohla's technology, and later fully recovered from his advanced Leukemia. At the event he said the procedure likely saved his life. Studies have show cord blood transplants, which Nohla is working to improve, could have better long-term outcomes for Leukemia patients. ",

Sensu, previously known as Heavy Water, recently announced a $2.5 million investment led by Foundry Group with participation from angel investors like Seattle-based entrepreneur Matt Shobe. The Portland-based startup helps customers monitor their cloud-based computer networks, servers, services, application health, and business KPIs. Sensu CEO Caleb Hailey and co-founder Sean Porter originally came up with the idea for Sensu while working on an internal project to replace an aging Nagios installation for cloud information archiving company Sonian. Fast forward several years later and the co-founders are now building their own business around that initial project. \"At Sensu we believe that as more companies shift to using software to deliver value to their customers, the availability of that software becomes a matter of critical importance,\" Hailey said in press release. \"Even brief periods of critical application downtime represent significant losses in revenue. This trend is driving more and more organizations to make monitoring a core competency rather than an IT/operational concern.\" Having Foundry Group lead its seed round is nice validation for Sensu given that the Boulder, Colo.-based VC firm invested in other Portland cloud companies like Urban Airship and Cloudability. Sensu will use the fresh cash to grow its 7-person team, The Oregonian noted. ",

      "content": "Raj Singh (left) and Mike Hilton (right), co-founders of Concur and now leaders at healthcare tech startup Accolade. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop)\n When Raj Singh and Mike Hilton co-founded Concur with Steve Singh more than two decades ago, the technology startup scene in Seattle was quite different than it is today. The web was in its infancy. And Seattle wasn't really on the map as a tech city yet. \"It was a different world,\" Hilton recalled. \"For one, there was no venture capital in Seattle really to speak of. There was one or two firms, and tech was just hieroglyphics (to them). So the only place to go was Silicon Valley.\" It's a new era now. Singh and Hilton left Concur after enterprise technology giant SAP travel and expense management company German software company SAP for $8.3 billion in 2014. And just over a year ago, they embarked on another startup journey: taking the helm of healthcare tech startup Accolade. Speaking on the GeekWire podcast, Hilton and Singh said that their journey back into the startup world has been eye-opening. \"It was like a breath of fresh air. I look at where we are today compared to where when we started Concur in 1993, there really wasn't a tech community -- if you didn't work at Microsoft -- to speak of in Seattle,\" Hilton said. Now, Seattle has investment resources, tech-savvy venture capitalists, startup incubators, a strong entrepreneurial program at the University of Washington, and a thriving startup ecosystem and community. \"I am so encouraged and excited about where the Seattle tech scene is,\" he said. Raj Singh echoed those sentiments, and added that Seattle is a tech hub in its own right. \"Let's remove the chip on our shoulder about San Francisco. We don't have to be San Francisco,\" he said. \"There are things about [Seattle], whether it's the tech community, whether it's the environment, whether it's the cost of living, whether it's the politics, that are spectacular ... that are better in this city than they are anywhere else.\" In fact, Seattleites are starting to see San Francisco less as a talented older sibling and more as a warning of how growth can get out-of-hand. \"My concerns would lean towards: how do we have smart plans when it comes to development, and are we growing smartly? I think growing is a great problem to have, and growth-related problems are the problems you want,\" Hilton said. While the community grapples with these challenges, Hilton and Singh say they are happy to be back in the grind of startup life, and are excited to continue embracing Seattle's startup community. Listen to the podcast of our full conversation with Singh and Hilton above, and keep reading for an edited transcript.  John Cook: You joined up with Accolade just about 14 months ago. Tell us about what that's been like in terms of the journey going from a big company in Concur back to the startup ranks here. Although it's a startup with 800 people, so a little bit of a different twist. Raj Singh: That's right, it is a different twist. Why don't you take it, Mike? Mike Hilton: Yeah, first of all it's been a great journey: the 14 months for me -- incredibly satisfying. I'm having more fun than I've had in a long time. Obviously, when we left Concur, it was a billion-dollar company, and it's continued to grow and do well. To go back to a much smaller environment is an adjustment. A lot of friends who questioning, I think, both of our sanity for wanting to go back and roll up our sleeves and get to work. But Raj and I took nine months off after we left Concur and explored a lot of options, and we really settled on Accolade very purposefully, I think. We're very inspired by the mission. We wanted to go and build something again. I think we're fundamentally entrepreneurs and builders at heart. I know I am. I think that's playing out. It's a joy to come to work every day. It's really fun being closer to things again, getting hands dirty, so for me it's been a great experience. Singh: I would only add, to your point John, that it is a different thing. We went through every stage of growth at Concur, from zero to coming up on the end about 5,000 employees. You think you remember what the early days are like. I think even Mike would attest that the first six months was a brand new learning experience to remember what the maturity level of a company is with 700 employees. And so there was an adjustment period, absolutely certain an adjustment period.  It's really fun being closer to things again, getting hands dirty, so for me it's been a great experience.But to Mike's point, we were really most focused on this idea that health care is a place in the United States where you could have a really positive impact and build a great business. That sustained us through that first six months of adjustment period, and now we're having a good time. Now it's all ours. Cook: I think it would be hard to step into a 700-person company because they have their own culture, they have their own style set up, and here you are these West Coast Seattleites jumping into the mix. Did that cause any tension at all during the process? Singh: Certainly there was an adjustment period for everybody involved. When we came in, you're exactly right -- this was a company based in Philadelphia and here we are in Seattle, and Philly and Seattle are two different towns for sure, and two different vibes. But we spent a lot of time digging in with Accolade before we joined. The mission of the company is so centrally -- ultimately, what do we do? We help people navigate through the healthcare system to get the best possible care for them and their families. And the people who are attracted to that company, whether they're in Philly or whether they're in Seattle, have some things in common. Meaning, they're mission-based people who want to build something great but want to do it while doing something great, which we sort of bridge the divide between the two cities Todd Bishop: For people who may not have followed this, the background here is that you led and built Concur from the ground up into a travel and expense management technology giant, and it was sold to SAP for $8.3 billion, so obviously one of the most successful exits of a startup out of Seattle in a long time. I can't imagine -- can you think of any that were bigger, John? Cook: No, that's one of the biggest on record certainly, and a testament to these guys. They'll even tell the story, I'm sure, of -- it wasn't always easy for them because there were times when Concur was trading in the pennies, right? Hilton: 28 cents, or whatever it was. Cook: 28 cents, yes. Singh: Not that we remember that. Cook: There were investors out there that missed the mark on that. There was a buying opportunity at one point. Hilton: We had an $8 million market cap at our lowest and we had many times that in the bank in cash for those of us that were around-- Cook: People had given up in other words. Hilton: A lot of people who don't know the whole story of Concur don't remember. We were given up for dead, and it wasn't always up and to the right. There's a lot of great stories there. But absolutely, it was a 22-year ride for us and not always up and to the right. Cook: In that instance, with Concur, you were trying to transform and disrupt how travel expense forms were processed and essentially moved into the cloud and people could work with their expense management forms. Now you're trying to do something similar with health care. Both are kind of complex, bureaucratic industries. What are the lessons from Concur that you've transferred over to Accolade? Singh: The first and foremost is that the consumer of health care and the consumer of travel, especially when you're talking on the business travel side, have to be at the center of how you try to solve the problem. In the business travel world, oftentimes it was more focused -- the other constituencies in that ecosystem -- oftentimes were more focused on cost or more focused on compliance than they were on the consumer. I think what Concur brought to the table was saying were going to be obsessed with the consumer and doing the right thing by the consumer. The healthcare industry needs some obsession with the consumer, and the motives are not aligned, the incentives are not aligned to create that obsession. Meaning, the people who are paying for healthcare are not the same people who are receiving it. The people who are delivering health care are getting paid by different people than the ones who receive it. All of that lack of alignment needs to be solved.  The healthcare industry needs some obsession with the consumer, and the motives are not aligned... to create that obsession.Bishop: In a nutshell, what are you trying to do at Accolade to solve that? Hilton: Accolade was really founded -- and we're continuing to push forward -- on the idea that, in a world of consumer-centered health care, you've really got to focus on the consumer experience. There's this belief that if you can do the right thing for the consumer, when you answer their questions, when you help them navigate to the right care, get them to the right spot the first time, you're not only going to create a delighted consumer -- you're going to improve their health because they're going to get the right care the first time. There's a lot of studies that show that of the $3 trillion that get spent every year on health care in the US, about a trillion of that is wasted because people just don't know what to do. They make the wrong choices. If you can get them to the right care the first time, you're going to make them healthier, but you're actually going to save money on healthcare cost. It's what they call the triple aim in health care: happier consumers, better health, and cheaper costs. That's what we're aiming to do, very much focused first and foremost on the consumer experience. So as a product person -- back to the question of thinking about the analogies to Concur -- all industries are moving to the cloud. That's a huge component here. Health care is absolutely ripe to go move to the cloud. It's becoming more about ecosystem connectivity, and healthcare is a lot like business travel in that it's an incredibly complex ecosystem, in fact, much more complex and in many ways much more antiquated and much more ripe for reinvention. Lastly, you need to have digital consumer experiences to go augment the offline experiences. That's a huge component of health care as well. Most of you would probably agree, there are not great mobile experiences when you think of health care. Simple questions, we're incredibly focused on all of those things. Bishop: Who's your customer?  There's a lot of studies that show that of the $3 trillion that get spent every year on health care in the US, about a trillion of that is wasted because people just don't know what to do.Singh: That's maybe the most interesting part of the story. The people who pay for health care right now, your employers -- so if you're a decent size employer, say you have 2,500 or 3,000 people in the United States, you pay for health care for your employees. You might contract with a health plan to do the transactional bill paying, or for their network so that you can use their doctors and their negotiated rates, but the dollars come right out of your bank account. So we sell to self-insured employers who are covering the cost of insurance for their people, or we'll sell to health plans and health systems. The world's changing a lot in health care, and it's going to change even more as we have a new administration in place, but health plans, when you're working at a smaller business, oftentimes those health plans take the risk on your coverage. So we sell to self-insured employers and to plans. What they do is they provide our service which is really a navigation service for their employees which is built off of people, like incredible people who help people navigate through the healthcare system as well as ... Those people are surrounded by clinicians, doctors, nurses, claims specialists, pharmacists. All of that is tied out to a whole set of technology tools that Mike referenced before: mobile applications, analytics capabilities, and really importantly a machine learning capability that says when we watch a how a diabetic progresses through the system, the next time someone who comes in with attributes like that diabetic, we can be smarter and smarter about the care we give them.

Cook: Isn't this frustrating for you guys as technologists, trying to dive into health care? Because this has been talked about for a long, long time. Everyone has talked about how health care needs to be disrupted, but it seems like it just stays a morass. How do you navigate that as technologists that want to make immediate change? Hilton: Yeah, it's a great question. There's a lot of ways to look at it. I've had people tell me 'you're an idiot for trying to solve health care,' because there's a lot of scorched earth behind you. And there's been a lot of money thrown at trying to solve health care. Go back to the early days of the internet, just a long list of people who have tried to tackle the problem. Because the argument will be you're staring at a lot of big, giant corporations, pharmaceuticals or health plans or giant provider networks, and it's very difficult to affect change. You can either see that as a challenge or as an opportunity. We're obviously the kinds of people -- and had to deal with that in the business travel world with Concur -- I see tremendous opportunity. And the world is changing. It's a really important thing that's different today than even five or 10 years ago. Five years ago, there was about a billion dollars a year being invested in health care by venture. Today, that number, -- 2016, I think it was about $6 billion, roughly that number. So you've seen this dramatic spike in venture private equity-type investment in health care. It's the number one sector that that kind of money is going into now. That's going to eventually lead to innovation and change and disruption. It's one of those industries that's just ripe for reinvention. And I think that we are finally at a place where a combination of the investment, the technology advancements, as well as just economically health care has to do something different. The conditions are pretty ripe for change. We see us as being in a great spot because the consumer is really becoming the center of the problem, and we're focused on a solution that's very much about the consumer experience.  There's a lot of ways to look at it. I've had people tell me 'you're an idiot for trying to solve health care,' because there's a lot of scorched earth behind you.Singh: To add to that, I would say, here's what we know. We spend more on health care in this country than in other country in the world, per person. We spend about $10,000 per person. In the developed world, countries that are getting better outcomes than we get here in the United States are spending $4,000, $4,500, $5,000 per person. Health care is 19% of the US GDP. One out of every five dollars spent in this country is spend on health care. It's staggering. You're talking about a $3 trillion space -- that grows. If you look over the last 10 years, the growth rate is somewhere on average between 5% and 7% depending on whose numbers you look at. Here's one thing we know for a fact: health care can never be 100% of GDP. It can't keep growing this fast. We have to figure out a way to control it. The government has taken a stab at trying to control it, via things like the Affordable Care Act. This administration will take another stab at public policy changes that are trying to control healthcare costs. But we know for a fact that costs can't continue to go up at this click. It's just not sustainable. Specifically, it's not sustainable for US employers who are saying, \"I have to compete on a global market and I pay twice as much for health care as everybody else that's doing business outside the United States.\" Now the challenging part of the story is that health care is, people talk about it as a $3 trillion space like I just did, but really it's about 3,000 $100 million space or a $10 million spaces, because it's regional. Your coverage and your care is often very regionally focused. We've got 14 major health systems here in the Seattle area. Then on top of that, it's broken out by the category of care you get. I mean this is how complex the system is. You've got Medicare for people who are over 65. You have Medicaid for people who are economically disadvantaged. You've got self-insured employers. You've got the Veterans Administration. Every one of those systems is different, has a different set of problems, and has a different set of needs for the consumers. That's the complexity that really -- when it stops people in their tracks, it's because you might be used to in the old world, or maybe in our old world, for Mike and I building software solutions, you think, \"I build it once, and I solve the problem for everybody.\" Here, that 65-year-old or that 70-year-old Medicare consumer is a hell of a lot different than the 25-year-old who's working at Google. Their needs are different, their care coordination and management is different, and you've got to think about your solutions in that kind of context. That's where it's super complicated. Cook: I was just to say, I was going to make the point, it's like developing for different operating systems. Whether you're developing for iOS or Android, well, maybe not Windows phone anymore but similar. That's what struck me as you were providing that example. Singh: For Mike at our company here, every technology dollar we spend has to be massively leveraged so that it can apply across the different market segments that we're serving. I would say, and you tell me if you agree with this Mike, we have to be way smarter about the spend because it's way more complicated and the space is way more fragmented. Hilton: Yeah, I would agree 100 percent. And we have an interesting service that is a combination of humans and technology. Health care, it's different from a lot of other things. One, it's really emotional. Your health, your family's health, there's nothing more personal than that. I equate it to buying a house times a hundred. You think of big financial decisions, those are emotional, and that's why real estate agents still exist. You want help. You need advice. You need guidance. Health care is like that times a million. Your kid's sick, your spouse is sick, there's nothing that gets you more emotional that can lead to bad decisions, can lead to stress, and you're not generally in a good mode. Then it's compounded by the fact that you have an ecosystem that's so complicated. It's just hard to understand, even when you're in a good state of mind. So we have a huge human component to what we do. It's essential, and we're augmenting that with technology. So the 25-year-old Google engineer can be texting through our mobile app for advice or self-serving things that they need. Whereas that Medicare patient is going to want to talk to somebody. Asking them to use a mobile app is not going to work. They're going to need a different kind of conversation, different kind of care. So I would agree with the point that our dollars have to bring those together for maximum leverage. Bishop: Let's talk about the elephant in the room. The Affordable Care Act is going to be repealed, apparently, and replaced in some form. It's unclear what it's going to do. Do you have thoughts on what should be changed based on your last 14 months or so? Singh: It appears that that's true. The Affordable Care Act will repealed. But I would say this, if you had asked me that same question the day after the inauguration, I wouldn't have said exactly that. But it appears at this point, based on the behavior of the administration, that that's what's going to happen. And they're not entirely crisp today on what their replace strategy is going to be, which means here's really what's going to happen right now. We think for sure they're going to try to retain some components of the ACA that people like. You can still cover your kids under 26 years old on your policy. If you have a preexisting condition, you can't be denied access to care.  There are some really hard things to manage next that the Republican administration and Congress are going to have to figure out how to deal with.On the flip side of that, things like the individual mandate, which was the requirement that everyone in the country buy insurance for themselves -- which ultimately was how the country was paying for coverage for those who couldn't afford it or who were sick and had preexisting conditions -- the individual mandate appears to be going away. It also appears that a lot of the taxes that funded Obamacare will go away. There are some really hard things to manage next that the Republican administration and Congress are going to have to figure out how to deal with. If you're not going to ban preexisting conditions, if you're going to keep kids on coverage, that means you're going to still have some very sick people who have access to care. Somebody has to pay for them. Bishop: And if you take the mandate away? Singh: If you take the mandate away, there's only a couple of things you can do. Paul Ryan's plan speaks to the idea that they want to create what's called high-risk pools. Those pools are for the sickest of the sick, and that the government, in some way, shape, or form, piles out a bunch of money to go pay for those people. Those haven't traditionally worked. This is an idea that has been tried in the United States in the past and hasn't traditionally worked. This administration today is saying that they're going to dump way more money into those high-risk pools than they have ever before. If that's true, we'll see. It's never been tried with $25 billion available to a high-risk pool, so we'll see. Today, I would say there's a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen, and it's a little scary. The last point, because I'm rambling on -- the one thing that really did happen with the Affordable Care Act that I think we should acknowledge is that the debate has now shifted from should people have coverage to the fact that, yes, you should have coverage, how should you get coverage? That's a beautiful thing, number one. Number two, there are elements to the Affordable Care Act that had nothing to do with getting people coverage. They had to do with shifting the conversation in our country away from what's called fee-for-service -- which is perform the operation, get paid a certain amount -- to fee-for-value. Are you delivering value to the consumer? Are you improving their lives? That fee-for-value conversation has now been embraced by the private sector. That, which I think got a huge boost from the Affordable Care Act, is a trend that won't go away even if they repeal the Affordable Care. Hilton: Great points. The only things I would add, first I find it fascinating how much public support there is for the Affordable Care Act and how much resistance there is to repealing it. The support for some of those core tenets that Raj spoke to speaks to the fact that regardless of where go from here, there's some really important tenets that have been put in place that the American people want to keep. Preexisting condition is a huge one. I think that's a good thing. That's nothing but a good thing. But when I step away from the broader trends and think about product and what I have to build, I think that there's trends that are going to continue in terms of the impact to all of us as consumers. Deductibles are going to continue to go up. There's a broad theme, which is that responsibility is getting pushed down to each of us. My parents never had to worry about health care the way that I do, in terms of which doctor should I go to? Which care should I select for which situations I'm in? Because it's increasingly my dollars at stake. I just think that puts a tremendous burden on being educated, knowing how to navigate the healthcare system which traditionally has been extraordinarily difficult, and just giving me some guidance, help me. So you have this interesting industry where traditionally the consumer experience has not been good, not easy to navigate, not easy to understand, and we're being forced as consumers to have to deal with that.  There's a broad theme, which is that responsibility is getting pushed down to each of us.That's kind of at the center of what Accolade is about. We're trying to create a very delightful experience on top of this really hard problem. I think regardless of where the Affordable Care Act goes, there's these broad trends -- that's going to do nothing but increase. That consumer focus and consumer responsibility is the constant theme that I think is here to stay for us as Americans. Singh: That's so important when you think about, if you're making $70,000 a year and your deductible keeps going up and now your deductible is $4,000, your healthcare decisions are mission, mission critical. Meaning, you're making some choices on different days as you eat into that deductible between rent, groceries, car, and health care. So the capacity to understand -- those deductibles going up has effectively shifted the decision to the consumer. When they make mistakes, they can be really catastrophic to their lifestyle and to their lives. That's a new thing that's happened in this country over the last 10 years and is maybe even more pronounced given some of the policy shifts that we might see. Cook: How do you think the new administration might impact your business? Hilton: Well, I think this last conversation is very related to a lot of that. I think, as Raj spoke, exactly what the replace part of repeal and replace is is still a bit uncertain. We happen to have some great board members at Accolade and experts that we get to draw from. We're very connected to what's going on in Washington. And I think there's still a lot of questions that are being answered. There's not consensus on some core questions to exactly where health care will be going. Again, I would say, I think in terms of the impact to Accolade, I don't think the very broad trend of consumers being asked to do more themselves, being asked to take on more responsibility for the choices they make in health care -- that's the broad trend that no matter what happens, I think we have a lot of confidence that that's here to stay. Again, I do think that that's at the center of what Accolade is about is we provide someone who's on your side. We provide tools that make it delightful for you to figure out what my benefits are, what my deductibles are, helping you find a doctor, answering that question about the bill. \"I got denied a claim. I have no idea what happened.\" Those are the everyday problems that we solve, and those problems are not going away. Singh: Yeah, John, I would say it's unlike to have a really material impact in terms of their healthcare policy. Immigration policy, different story. But healthcare policy is unlikely to really have a material impact because our customer is really the private sector. Cook: I do want to talk to you about immigration. Singh: That's a shocker! Cook: Obviously, this has been a hot button issue here in the last several days. Raj, a lot people might know you were born in the US, but your parents were both immigrants from India. Singh: And my brother and sister were both born in India. Cook: And your brother and your sister, Steve Singh, who's still at Concur SAP and leading the ship there. Singh: Yeah, he's doing OK for himself over there. Cook: Yeah, I'm sure. How has this last few days struck you as a child of immigrants and with a brother and sister who were born in a foreign country? Singh: I would say, you're right. Because I'm the child of immigrants and my brother and sister were both born outside the country, maybe it has a specific painful, emotional impact on me. But I think -- here's the beautiful news about this country -- I think it had a painful, negative impact on a lot of people who aren't immigrants or who were immigrants three or four or five generations ago. I'm going to digress, and then I'm going to answer your question. One of the most beautiful things that happened this weekend is I looked online and I saw people going to JFK and LAX and SeaTac. No one wants to go the airport but to go to protest for people that weren't you, it was just like a beautiful, emotional reminder of how great this country can be. It was awesome. Now, let me answer your question. This policy fundamentally, in my mind, attacks what's beautiful and great about this country. In fact, Mike and I both spoke out pretty vocally this weekend about what we think, which is this is bad business. It's bad morally. It's bad ethically. It's bad politics. It's bad everything. By the way, there's a whole bunch of national policy security experts who will tell you it's not going to make us safer either, and so this is bad all the way around.  This policy fundamentally, in my mind, attacks what's beautiful and great about this country.For me personally, and I mentioned this to you before we walked in here, John, we have an iOS developer who is on a green card --a lready gone through the process of getting a green card -- who was in Baghdad last week and was trying to get back in the country this weekend. He got through. With some delays, he got through. But the idea that that young man has to go through some sort of crazy additional scrutiny to get back into the country after all he's already gone through to get here is absurd. So how do I feel about it? It was emotionally painful for me, but more importantly I think it was a good moment for all of us to remember, hey, we've got to stand up and talk about this stuff. Because if we don't, it doesn't matter how good our business is, we're deteriorating what makes the place great. Cook: I don't think it was you, I think I've heard Steve, your brother, talk about your father and how he would tune into the Concur earnings calls. And that was his entertainment, would be listening in on Concur earnings calls. A couple questions there: first off, what has he said? Have you been able to talk to him about what's transpired here on the immigration ban? Singh: Oh, we traded emails on this. My dad would-- this is even not about the seven banned countries, because India's not one of those seven banned countries, but if you look at the trajectory on immigration in this country -- if you read Satya's statement from Microsoft, if you read the CEO of Google's statements, every single one of these guys is saying the same thing: our industry is fueled by the most brilliant brains around the planet, and they don't all necessarily come from the United States. They come from all over the world. So our capacity to maintain a leadership level of innovation is required to be able to access the most brilliant brains in the world. I did have a chance to email with my father this weekend. His reaction, as you might expect from a first generation immigrant, was, \"hey, make sure and speak. Say what's on your mind because people need to hear.\" Bishop: I'll point out those executives, the CEOs that you just mentioned are both immigrants themselves. Singh: Immigrants. Bishop: Then you have Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Expedia. Singh: From Iran. Bishop: Right. Singh: From Iran, one of the seven banned nations. Bishop: That's right. Singh: We're probably better off with Dara, don't you think? Bishop: Yes, yes. Singh: I think so, too. Bishop: Mike, any thoughts on this? Hilton: I couldn't agree more. I'm one of the people Raj referred to -- most of my family is several generations immigrated. I have relatives back the 1700s from the US, so I'm kind of on the other side mostly, American mutt, like many of us from way back. But I think to Raj's point, this isn't about just immigrants. It's about all of us. I think it's a fundamental right for all Americans that's under threat here. So I couldn't agree more with this idea that it's incumbent upon every American to speak up. As Raj said, it hit home personally for us. Having someone in our Accolade family that was impacted and spending the weekend not just watching the news but effectively having to deal close to home, it really puts it in perspective. This isn't some hypothetical problem. It's a real problem. I'm very committed to my opposition to this and to making sure that we get it right. Cook: You've seen the tech industry really speaking out quite vocally about this. I'm curious, the industry you're in -- health care -- I've haven't seen as much energy going towards this. Why do you think other industries aren't stepping up here, and what can you do maybe to get leaders from other businesses and other business segments to join in? Singh: I think there's a false narrative out there, John, that says it's bad for business to talk about politics. I think that's generally true. I mean Mike and I have been in this neighborhood for 22, 23 years. The number of times we've vocally talked about politics as it relates to business is probably zero. But there are moments where I think you have to think bigger than your business. I think in the healthcare sector right now, I think there's a bunch of CEOs --and I think some probably have spoken out and we haven't read about them -- but there are a bunch of CEOs saying, \"well, I'm not sure what's going to happen with the Affordable Care Act. I'm not sure what's going to happen with prescription medication and their prices. I'm not sure what's going to happen around regulation associated with shared risk. There's a bunch of things, and I'm not sure what's going to happen, and I don't want to make anybody mad right now.\" I think, though, what was nice about watching Satya and others come out and speak was that sometimes you just got to come out and say what's on your mind because it's the right thing to do. So more people will. More people will. Hilton: Just thinking back, same sex marriage in Washington State was one of the times at Concur where we were vocal and spoke up and took a stand. I think to Raj's point, there are certain issues that cross the threshold that require speaking out. This, without question, is one of them.   I think there's a false narrative out there... that says it's bad for business to talk about politics. Cook: Raj, I mentioned your father joining those Concur earnings calls back in the day. Singh: That's a true story. Cook: And he was giving advice and feedback on the way you should be running this company and this business. Has he provided any advice or feedback as it relates to the healthcare business, and what have you taken from him? Singh: Mike mentioned that there was a bunch of people who told us how crazy starting over again was. He was a guy, notably -- and my mom, by the way -- on the other side of that equation. And he was a guy I sought out for sure, and Mike probably sought it out as well, and his advice was very much, \"it's time to follow your heart. Do what you think is right.\" Here's the good news about that, John, I think when we started Concur, we followed our heart. Here, we thought, \"Hey, you know, maybe we know a little bit more 22 years later, or maybe we're a little bit smarter, and if we're a little bit smarter, maybe we can tackle something even crazier and harder and one that a lot of people have gone up the hill and fallen back down the hill on.\" But it was a little scary. It was certainly scary. He was a nice steel in my spine when I was a little scared and thought, \"you know, it'd probably be easier to go do something else,\" to say, \"why would you go do something easy? Easy's not what you're searching for.\" Which, I think, is, by the way, pretty good advice. Cook: So 14 months in, what's the biggest thing you've learned about the healthcare business? Singh: This is definitely not easy. Hilton: Here's the answer I'd give, John. A big part of choosing this particular company and industry for me was the mission. Again, we all have health stories: us, our families, our friends. Health affects us all. It's a huge problem. It's really messed up in the US. I have been more inspired by the mission part of Accolade than I even expected I would be. To be at a company that actually saves lives -- every week there's stories where we're saving lives, it's a pretty special company. At Concur, we made business trips easier, which is awesome and I'm so proud that we did that for hundreds of millions of people. But saving lives is another level. The fundamental impact we can have on a family, it's really inspiring, far more so than I even thought it would be. The other corollary to that is I think being inside of a company of like-minded people who are equally inspired by that who came to this company very deliberately -- I work with a lot of people who could probably be doing a lot bigger things and making more money in terms of that being bigger -- but deliberately chose to work here. It just creates a really special space. I think health care is really special in that way. Singh: When we first sat down and talked with the two of you, we were probably just getting started in Seattle for Accolade. Soo it was February, March maybe I think. We were five guys in the office. We expected to be about 50 by the end of '16. We're about 70 right now. We're staffing faster than we thought we would, which is hard to do in this market, and a lot of that is mission. Bishop: This is the Seattle region specifically? Singh: This is the Seattle office, exactly right. We're just on 7th and Pike. We're 70 people strong now, and we'll be at 100 in the not too distant future. Bishop: Is the corporate headquarters technically both places? Singh: It really is. It's in both places. It's actually fantastic. Meaning, what you have in Philadelphia is you've got Penn. You've got Temple. You've got Drexel. You've got some unbelievable colleges in town. Here in town, of course, you've got unbelievable world-class talent. I think when we first got to Philadelphia and we said, \"hey, we're going to open up another headquarters in Seattle, don't worry; it's going to be fine,\" people in Philadelphia were a little, \"Aaah, I don't know about you Seattle guys.\" But we've grown the Philadelphia office, and we've grown the Seattle office.  I have been more inspired by the mission part of Accolade than I even expected I would be.I'd say the short answer to how you overcome those sorts of issues, one, it takes time. People -- they've got to hear your words and then watch you execute on your words. Two is you define your culture. You define your values. You define your mission. You say, \"this is what we believe in, and we're going to behave this way, no matter if you're in the Seattle office or in the Scottsdale office or in the Philadelphia office.\" By the way, we opened another office in Prague as well. What we're seeking are the most brilliant people in the world who can come help us solve this stupid, hard problem. Because all of those offices are growing now, people are through any concern of where the nexus of power is. The nexus of power is people who are kicking ass. Bishop: Mike and Raj, you probably don't know this, I had my first newspaper job in Philadelphia, so I'm a little familiar with the media market there. Talk about the difference -- I'm sure you've been interviewed by reporters there. John George, I'm sure, has probably been knocking on your door. Singh: Sure, yeah. Bishop: How do the reporters compare? Who's tougher? Singh: Reporters everywhere are kind of tough guys. They're kind of tough. I think that in the Philly market-- Bishop: Come on, answer the question, Raj! Singh: Have you ever been to a football game in Philadelphia? Bishop: I have. I've dodged batteries being thrown from the stands. Singh: I would say that the Philadelphia, New Jersey, greater New York area has a greater tendency to get to the point really fast. They're not all that concerned with the backstory. They want to know what you're doing right now. And t's not as tech-focused. It's way more focused on the business angle or the healthcare angle. It's a huge healthcare market. Bishop: It is. Singh: Here, people want to talk more about tech, and they are a little bit more interested in the backstory because we're Seattleites. Cook: You're kind of the size here at 800 -- I don't know if you've disclosed revenues or not-- but 800 employees, I would think there's a significant amount of revenue behind the business, and it seems to be growing. Have you considered or talked about taking the company public? Is that in the cards for Accolade? Singh: Get ready for my filibuster here. Cook: I wanted to do a tougher Philly question here. Bishop: Here's the Philly question: \"hey, when are you going public?\" Singh: Yeah, there it is. We're totally focused on building something great and enduring here. We just raised a round of capital in June -- I think June, July, somewhere around there, we raised some capital. We're in good shape as it relates to capital. Here's what we're super focused on. We're finding great traction in the employer market, and we're finding great traction in the health plan market. If we're continuing to grow at the clip we're growing, then there is a next step for us. Whether that's a public offering or whether that's raising more capital, we're not 100% certain, John. The mission of the company isn't to go public or anything like that. The mission of the company is to keep growing. Hilton: It's the beauty of your last gig being 22 years long, you can have some credibility when you say, \"I'm not in it for the short-term.\" Cook: You're not going to flip this one. Hilton: Yeah, we're not exactly flippers, and we can say that with some credibility. Cook: I'm sure your backers and investors appreciate that. That was another comment you made in terms of, you had to go out and raise venture capital again. What was that like for you? Hilton: Yeah, that was fun. Boy, Concur went public in-- Cook: Did Things change in 20 years in the venture market? Hilton: Oh my god. Well, Concur went public in the late '90s so venture capital for me -- I was the CEO of Concur in the very beginning and had to raise the first two rounds as the CEO. It was a different world. For one, there was no venture capital in Seattle really to speak of. There was one or two firms, and tech was just hieroglyphics. So the only place to go was Silicon Valley. That's an enormous difference to have a company like Madrona come in in our last round and just to have local venture capital. That scene, that's as mature as it is, is a huge change for this region. I think it's a huge part of why we're doing so well, an important part of the ecosystem. Yeah, it's very different, of course. You got to think back -- when Concur raised money, there was no internet. Cook: There was no angel list! Hilton: You were still printing out pitches. Cook: No unicorns, no super angels. Hilton: Exactly. Bishop: No Donald Trump. No, wait. No, he was there but just different capacity. Hilton: Fun but different I would say. Singh: There's a ton more capital in the market. We were lucky because this is way we do it. This is our style: right when we got there, the market kind of went to hell. So we didn't want to choose an easy time to do it. We waited until the market was on its cusp. Then we jumped in and went out to raise capital. We were lucky enough that -- Andreessen Horowitz and Madrona were the guys we wanted. Those were the two firms that we absolutely wanted to do business with. We knew each of them from our past lives, and we were incredibly fortunate to find them. The market has mass influxes of capital when the market's hot, like way more than it ever used to be, and so all of a sudden it gets almost ridiculously simple to raise capital. Then when it dries up, it dries up in ridiculous way, and companies get punished for it. So we were lucky to skip that. Cook: Where do you think it's at now in terms of the market for venture capital startups raising money? Singh: In the healthcare tech space, which is where we really classify ourselves, John, it's tough to know right now as a company. If you're looking at a company like Oscar, for example, that raised $400 million or some number like that -- don't quote me on the exact number, but it's a number like that -- and they built their whole business focused on Affordable Care Act exchanges. I mean that's a huge bet on a single thing. It seemed like a really smart bet in 2008, when there was a bunch of really smart investors who funded it. People are going to figure out what happens to Oscar now. What's going to happen to these guys who placed huge bets or built businesses around those exchanges? I think you're seeing more waiting on the sidelines right now until the -- public policy has a massive impact on health care, so until you understand public policy or know what direction the winds are blowing, you'll see more people sitting on the sidelines. Cook: But don't you think that's just going to go on for four years? Do you think in four years under this administration there's going to be a clear, concise path of where things are headed? Singh: You know John, it's a -- Cook: I mean personally I just think it's going to be week to week and a new -- Bishop: Crowd size debate. Cook: Yeah, a new debate each week. Singh: The private sector in a $3 trillion space is going to eventually land on -- if the president and his administration don't decide to move, there's a bunch of congressman who have to get reelected in two years and there's a bunch of senators who have to get reelected every two years as well. The market will push on some certainty. We're not going to get in the first 10 days. I totally agree, John, that this is the most dizzying first 10 days I've ever seen, but certainty will come. It will come over some time because I think -- and this is an interesting point that I never thought I would say -- I think there is a plan underneath what these guys are doing. It's just they're not ready to tell us what the plan is because I think there's going to be some pain in parts of the plan and they're not ready to tell you about the pain yet. But sooner or later, it's going to have to come out in the wash. Bishop: All right. Any other just final overarching thoughts on the Seattle tech community, where you guys are with the lessons learned? Any final thoughts that you've not made yet that you really want to get across? Hilton: Boy, just I am so encouraged and excited about where the Seattle tech scene is. That's a big thing I would say. Bishop: Really?  My concerns would lean towards: how do we have smart plans when it comes to development, and are we growing smartly?Hilton: Yeah, absolutely. As someone who was building a company for so long and relatively heads down, it wasn't until near end of Concur that I really made a lot of conscious effort to get back into the startup part of our community in particular. It was like a breath of fresh air. I look at where we are today compared to where when we started Concur in 1993, there really wasn't a tech community -- if you didn't work at Microsoft -- to speak of in Seattle. I look at where we are 20, almost 25 years later and it requires an ecosystem that includes people like you guys, and it includes the incubators we have. It includes the angels we have. It includes the University of Washington and the incredibly exciting things that are happening there. As someone who has to compete for talent every day, as someone who has a very vested interest in making sure this community is fantastic, I could not be more exited about the state of where we're at. In terms of things like a lot of Silicon Valley coming up here, I view that as a tremendous compliment to what we've done in the Northwest and I say, \"bring it on,\" and welcome it, and it's nothing but great news for our community. I think that the state that we are in is great. My concerns would lean towards: how do we have smart plans when it comes to development, and are we growing smartly? I think growing is a great problem to have, and growth-related problems are the problems you want. Singh: First of all, I agree with everything Mike just said. You guys were surprised by how bullish we are. Bishop: Yeah, I would say John's been a little down on the Seattle tech community lately. Singh: You know what? I would say I look at your bright spots. You look at what Sunny Gupta is doing at Apptio, or you look at, there's a bright spot of a tech company that started on Bainbridge Island that continues to grow, Avalara, that no one really talks about, but that company's actually on its way to being something very, very special around the world. Bishop: What? You mean people don't want to talk about sales tax automation? Singh: Exactly! Listen, brother, I grew up in expense reports, man. I spent 22 years of my life on expense reports. Cook: Seattle's really good at building really strong, boring businesses. Singh: Yeah, strong, boring companies that employ thousands of people and that keep growing. I think Mike's right, what Vikram and those guys are doing at the University of Washington kicks ass. I mean you go there, and you can't leave that center without being inspired about what's about to happen next. You think about the Bellevue campus that's about to come together with the Chinese university, the University of Washington, all of these things are very difficult to pull off. If I had anything that I would counsel people in Seattle If I had anything that I would counsel people in Seattle on, if I'm allowed to counsel people in Seattle, because I've been here for 23 or 24 years now so I feel like a native, is let's remove the chip on our shoulder about San Francisco. We don't have to be San Francisco. There are things about this city, whether it's the tech community, whether it's the environment, whether it's the cost of living, whether it's the politics, that are spectacular and are better in this city that are better in this city than they are anywhere else. That I'm super bullish on. Cook: I think that's changed I've seen in the last two or three years where the Seattle tech community used to look at Silicon Valley as something they aspired to be. Now there's a movement where how can we avoid the mess that's down there and build something that's extra special here? Singh: I think that's Mike's point on growth. Let's do growth right. Cook: Exactly. I was joking about the boring companies. Hilton: It's not the shining city on a hill. It's a harbinger for what we could become if we're not smart. That's how I think about it. Cook: Absolutely. I think that mind shift has actually started to change quite a bit. There's enough momentum here in Seattle now, especially with all the Silicon Valley tech companies that are coming in that want to be here and mine the talent, that we have to really watch how we grow so we don't repeat Silicon Valley's mess. Hilton: That's the diligence. I think if there's any core responsibility of the tech leaders, including us, it's to be really mindful about this problem because it will happen to us if we let it. We can become overwhelmed and end up with all the same problems. And that's a non-trivial problem. It's a non-trivial problem. Singh: Let me add one thing that we've tried to extra special, thoughtful on now that we're older. I don't want to say old because we're not old yet, are we? We're not old. Bishop: You're not. Singh: Thank you -- is that we have an opportunity now as well that there's a bunch of young companies being built in this city -- to focus on things that matter because they're going to make your company better if you do them from the outset. That's diversity. That's inclusion. That's women in leadership, women in engineering. Those types of things are areas that we can focus on, and we can be better in Seattle than we are anywhere else. You asked if there's one thing I wanted to get out. I would say: there's so much to be proud of here. There's things we can be better at. It's a city that wants to focus on those things and do the right things -- we should do those. ",

The Seattle startup just reeled in an additional $3 million from existing investors and Acorn Ventures. Total funding to date is now $16 million. Docusign co-founder Court Lorenzini heads up MetaBrite as CEO. He originally raised nearly $5 million for CookBrite, which was the name of his company that built a one-stop mobile meal-planning solution, acting as a digital shopping list and recipe book. But in November 2015, the startup changed its name to MetaBrite, expanding its focus toward a business intelligence platform. Now the company is committing 100-percent to the new platform and will shut down the existing CookBrite app later this month. MetaBrite has developed machine learning technology that can scan receipts and automatically extract precise item-level details from any retailer. It licenses its receipt processing SDK into multiple consumer-facing apps. \"Our application partners cover a wide variety of consumer use cases including brand loyalty and reward programs, lifestyle apps, and mobile consumer research to name a few,\" Lorenzini told GeekWire. There are now 30 people working for MetaBrite, up from 18 this time last year. Sam Lucente, who co-founded the company with Lorenzini, is no longer part of the executive team but still sits on the board. The startup also recently hired two new execs: Former Amazon manager Leigh Allen-Arredondo as director of design, and former Blackberry exec Mark Meuleman as vice president of business development. Other MetaBrite executives include Roy Penn, a former engineer with the Israeli Defense Forces; and Christine McKee, a former RealNetworks and Expedia executive. Other employees have experience at places like Kraft, McDonalds, IBM, and Nielsen. ",

      "content": "Moment founder Marc Barros with some of the design prototypes for the next generation of iPhone cases and lenses his company is making. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser)\n Marc Barros has spent three years building a team and a product and learning about his customer. Now, his Seattle-based startup Moment is ready to offer a second generation of lenses and cases to take mobile photography even further. With the launch of a new Kickstarter campaign today, Barros and the Moment team are looking to gauge how well they know their customer and get a read on the demand for a new trio of products for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. With a goal of $500,000, the company is also after the necessary funding to make those products and have them on phones by May or June. It's been a busy year of learning and adjusting for the small hardware maker. When we checked in with Barros last May, he had just raised $3 million in Series A funding and secured placement of Moment lenses and cases for the iPhone 6 in 50 Apple retail stores. Then came the tech giant's radically redesigned 7 and 7 Plus. \"You know it's coming because the internet says its coming, but you get nothing as far as advanced notice,\" Barros said of being prepared for a new iPhone. \"So anyone that makes just phone cases basically has to cheat -- they have to gamble. They look at the pictures online and they make a decision: 'Am I willing to tool this thing? Am I willing just to get really close?'\" Barros believes that if stuff shows up right away on Amazon, for instance, that means that manufacturer gambled. \"We can't [gamble] because the optical alignment is really, really important,\" Barros said. \"The camera moved in the 7 versus the 6. So we couldn't just make the lens and case; we had to wait to get the phone. That's the most trying part for us. Not only do we have to wait for them to announce it, you have to wait two or three weeks to get your hands on all of it. And then you have to assess if your entire product line works or if it's obsolete. So it's incredibly stressful. Thankfully the way they're implementing it, both one lens and two lens, the whole [Moment] system still works.\" Not starting from scratch certainly helps speed the process. The designers and engineers on Moment's 20-person team hit the ground running last fall when iPhone 7 came out. \"We're better at the design process. We have more talent, more experience,\" Barros said. \"We've been through a case once. You learn how the plastics mold, you learn a bunch of small details. By having a bunch of product out there you now have data back that tells you where it's failing.\" Barros said that a small hardware startup can't afford to endlessly prototype units like Apple or others can, so its early units end up being sold to customers. But he said this time around, with better suppliers and better experience, the engineering is much improved. This time they'll be offering a new, slightly larger wide-angle lens with improved glass ($99.99); a battery case (with built-in DSLR-style shutter button) that is constantly charging the phone and can be charged with an Apple lightning cable ($99.99); and a thinner photo case (without shutter) that accepts lenses ($29.99). Backers on Kickstarter will get access to reduced prices on individual items as well as deals on photo kits that group items together. \"The premise of the Kickstarter is to raise the money to tool,\" Barros said. \"To tool the wide [angle lens], the battery case in two sizes, and the photo case in two sizes, the bill starts to get significant. You're basically betting the entire company. You go to market without any understanding of whether customers care, you could bankrupt it. You need the customer demand.\" Successful Kickstarter campaigns got the company and its first generation of products off the ground in the past. In January 2014, a campaign for lenses raised $450,000. A year later, a campaign for the iPhone 6 case raised $693,000 in January 2015. Moment is relentlessly trying to get more customers. Barros said the operating mindset is to keep spending very tight, with low overhead, and focus on customer acquisition. \"You just obsess about what works to get a customer -- what do customers want? what do they like? -- so we just spend all our time on the customer,\" he said. Moment is \"constantly tinkering\" with shopping experiences, Barros said, and just started using Fulfillment by Amazon. But he said of everything they've tried, content seems to be producing the greatest return. The company's Momentist channel on its website serves as a gathering place for everything anyone might wish they could see and shoot through their smartphone camera. \"We tried a bunch of community-based things, but at the end of the day we found that the content and the content stories go the furthest,\" Barros said. \"We have products that make it possible to tell amazing stories: rich video and stunning photos in unique places. So the content has been working the best to reach a whole bunch of new people. Each piece of content can get shared and re-shared, so you get anywhere from 5 to 10,000 to 15,000 views on a piece of content and that's reaching a whole new audience.\" But it's clear that Barros is obsessed with wanting to know more about who is buying his products. While the wide lens is Moment's most popular item, being on Amazon's FBA for a few weeks has Barros realizing just how much the retail giant is driven by search. And he said people are searching much more for telephoto lenses than wide angle on Amazon. \"Adding the Amazon piece is like adding a whole other channel with data,\" Barros said. Selling lenses and cases through Apple stores last year was a nice way to get product in front of customers, but other than getting information back on how many units were sold, the experience provided no additional data on what type of customer was looking for what product. \"If you make a software product or software app, you get some idea of the demographic of the user,\" Barros said. \"You can interact with the user, you can message them. You put the [hardware] product in a retail store you get zero. You get a spreadsheet with unit sales.\" Barros is optimistic that Moment has figured out how to make something that mobile photographers want. But there is a risk involved in going back in front of potential customers to see if they're still willing to help fund a product's iteration. \"If this tanks, if customers say they don't want this, it forces us to go back to the board and figure out what happened,\" Barros said. \"Was the product wrong? Was the price wrong? Did people not care? You want to know that now before you go to tooling. Because it would take almost the majority of our cash to put all of these in motion with zero customer demand.\" But Barros believes, as he has from the start, that he's onto something that will last because Moment is realizing what other manufacturers continue to ignore. \"None of the phone accessory makers get it,\" Barros said. \"Those who make traditional phone cases and battery cases are essentially competing over the same functions: power, protection and price. None of them are saying, 'Oh, it's actually a camera.' That's our point of view, that we think we can win the market with these products.\" ",

      "content": "Shelf Engine co-founders Bede Jordan and Stefan Kalb. Photo via Shelf Engine.\n As his fresh salad and sandwich business started taking off a few years ago, Stefan Kalb realized he had a problem. Kalb, co-founder of Seattle-based Molly's, learned how difficult it was to predict customer order patterns. At the time, Molly's had 30 different menu items and delivered orders to more than 200 different customers each week. The root of the problem was all about how Molly's made bulk orders for perishable foods -- they were often not perfect. When orders should have been increased, they were decreased; when orders should have been decreased, they were increased. Sometimes, when an order needed to be changed, nothing was adjusted. In response, Kalb channeled his entrepreneurial energy and built software that helped Molly's purchase the right amount of bulk food to fulfill customer orders. The financial impact was so substantial that Kalb has turned that idea into a entirely new company. The result is Shelf Engine, a new 3-person Seattle startup that just raised a $800,000 seed round to help perishable food distributors and grocery stores fine-tune their item order patterns to both save money and reduce waste. The investment was led by Initialized Capital (Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian is a general partner), with participation from Founder's Co-op, Liquid 2 Ventures (Joe Montana is a general partner), and other angels. \"As seed investors, we're always excited to learn about new problems that have potentially valuable software solutions -- food waste is one of them,\" Ohanian wrote on ProductHunt today. \"In addition, it's also a social problem and at a time when there are still people who go hungry, Shelf Engine is a means to reduce waste and thus cost. The food industry hasn't had the ability to solve this with software and this app helps retailers and distributors reduce their waste.\"   In the company's case study, it explains how many managers often make orders based on their current waste numbers -- a flawed method, because \"that decision isn't based on a cumulation of waste and deliveries.\" This creates a \"whiplash effect\" where orders are fluctuating from week to week and products are either selling out or have a high level of waste. ShelfEngine is one of the first startups to utilize artificial intelligence for the perishable food industry, Kalb explained. There are existing solutions like GPS tracking and inventory management, but not so much in terms of data-crunching software that can predict what to order. Shelf Engine uses an order prediction engine and probability models that analyze historical order and sales data, gross margins, and shelf life information -- not just how much food is wasted. The more a customer uses the system, the more accurate its recommendations become. \"To make a real dent in your bottom line, your managers need to know exactly what to order,\" Kalb said. \"Shelf Engine uses several concurrent models that look at historical sales and correlations to generate a profit-maximizing order. We're one of the first on the scene to be doing this.\" Kalb, who was born in France and graduated from Western Washington with degrees in mathematics and economics, co-founded Shelf Engine with Bede Jordan, a Microsoft veteran who was most recently the principal software engineering lead for the company's HoloLens team. Kalb no longer works at Molly's, but still owns the food maker. ",

      "content": "(Cloaked Images).\n When (newly-public) Snapchat first arrived on the scene, its self-destructing messages felt like a game-changer. Finally, a way to send anything you want with the liberating knowledge that it'll be deleted just a few seconds later. But, as any high school student will tell you, it's not that simple. The recipient could always screenshot your message. Sure, Snapchat notifies you when someone saves your ephemera but, by then, it's too late. Enter: Cloaked. The Issaquah, Wash. startup developed and patented technology that makes it impossible to screenshot a photo or message. The app enables text messaging, a Snapchat-like photo tool, photo blurring capabilities, and an option to revoke a message after it's been sent. \"We saw a weakness in electronic communications and real-time presentations in that sensitive information was not protected from the intended recipients,\" said Cloaked CEO Charles Hill. \"Our goal was to create a technology in which sensitive information could be shared with recipients but eliminate the recipients ability to screen capture the information and share it without authorization.\" Those in need of a super-surreptitious messaging platform can get the app for free on iOS. We caught up with Hill for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"We have developed and patented a unique technology that does not allow clean screenshots to be taken. With this technology, confidential information and images can be sent to recipients without the risk of the recipients screen capturing the information and sharing it without authorization. Finally, you can send messages, photos, and videos safely that won't haunt you later.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"Everyday confidential information is distributed without authorization. Often, this information is not hacked, but rather, is shared by the intended recipient without authorization from the initial sender of the information. We saw an opportunity to fix this glaring problem by developing and patenting Active Screenshot Protection(tm) technology.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"We have developed our technology in-house without VC or angel investments. The founders possessed the needed technical skills, business acumen, and financial resources to progress without outside investment. Now that our technology is patented and proven our goal is to license our technology to existing platforms.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"The secret ingredient to our technology and related patent is that all of the information shared is never all on a display or projected at one time. Rather, various elements of text, images or videos are on the display for a moment while the missing elements would be displayed a brief moment later. This process continues at a high rate of speed resulting in clear text, images, and videos to the eye but, if screen captured, would only capture a small portion of the overall information resulting in an incomprehensible screenshot. This allows for confidential information to be shared with recipients without the worry of the recipient screen capturing the text, image or video and sharing it without authorization.\"  The smartest move we've made so far: \"We have developed a polished demonstration application to showcase our technology. We foresee integration of our core technology in numerous communication platforms and we developed our application to demonstrate how powerful the technology is and how easy it is to utilize. Everyone has always wished they could send a confidential text to someone without the worry of it being further shared. Our technology directly addresses this issue and can be tested in real-time, via our demonstration application, Cloaked - Txt & Pics w/o Screenshots, that is available at the App Store.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Our biggest mistake is not having developed our Active Screenshot Protection(tm) technology sooner. It is a technology that we utilize on a daily basis.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: 'We would prefer to have Gates, Zuckerberg, and Bezos in our corner. Our technology is relevant to all electronic communication platforms and would greatly enhance the user experience and retention if integrated. We want to improve the safety of confidential information and the confidence of senders of confidential information. We feel that all technology icons would see consumer benefit in our technology and we are hopeful that we can work together with them in the future.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Our favorite team-building activity is to continually improve our technology and to develop additional tools to enhance user experiences with electronic communications. We have several up our sleeves!\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"A potential hire must be well connected and understand the need for and complexities of modern electronic communications.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Clearly define a need and directly address it. Make sure there is an adequate market for your technology and understand the competitive environment and barriers to entry. If possible, try and protect your intellectual property with patent protection.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

Photo via Suplari.\n Three veteran entrepreneurs just raised a hefty seed round from top venture capital firms for their stealthy enterprise startup. Suplari today announced a $3.1 million investment from Madrona Venture Group and Amplify Partners. Nikesh Parekh, the company's CEO, told GeekWire that Suplari is in stealth mode and wouldn't reveal more details about its technology. The funding will be used to bring Suplari's first product to market. \"We are building an intelligent application focused on a unique data set in the enterprise that largely goes unmanaged today,\" he noted. Parekh, a real estate technology veteran who previously held leadership positions at Market Leader and Trulia, co-founded Suplari with CTO Jeff Gerber and CPO Brian White. Gerber is a long-time engineering leader who co-founded startups like iConclude (acquired by Opsware and later by HP) and most recently helped lead Apptio's machine learning and intelligent app development before the company went public last year. Parekh said Gerber originally approached him with the idea for Suplari. \"The 'data liberation' aspect of the business really appealed to me, particularly after seeing how Trulia and Zillow revolutionized real estate search by making data more accessible and approachable,\" he noted. White, meanwhile, worked with Gerber at iConclude as an early employee; he has experience working at places like Amazon Web Services and SkyTap. There are connections between the three founders and Madrona, one of the region's top VC firms. Gerber previously worked at three separate Madrona-backed companies; White worked for two Madrona-backed companies; Parekh was an entrepreneur-in-residence at the firm nine years ago. Parekh said Suplari is a \"great example of the importance of taking a long-term view on relationships, particularly in a city like Seattle.\" In a blog post, Madrona Managing Director Matt McIlwain said the firm's investment in Suplari is similar to other \"intelligent app\" startups it backs like Turi, Algorithmia, and MightyAI. He said \"intelligent apps\" is \"an area we helped define.\" \"Intelligent apps combine data and machine learning to provide real-time, actionable insight into business and consumer applications,\" McIlwain wrote.

Photo via Xnor.ai.\n Bringing artificial intelligence technology into the hands of consumers and businesses is no easy task; doing so takes a ton of computing and processing power. This is why it's difficult to equip personal devices like smartphones, wearables, cameras, and others with the same capabilities. But now a new Seattle startup thinks it has found a solution to make AI ubiquitous. Xnor.ai today announced a $2.6 million seed investment round from Madrona Venture Group and Paul Allen's Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), where the 6-person company originally developed its technology and is now spinning out of the non-profit into its own entity. Xnor.ai is the second spin-off to come out of AI2, which Allen helped launch in 2013. Kitt.ai did the same in 2015 and also raised funding from Madrona. Led by top machine vision and AI researchers, Xnor.ai has developed a way to run deep learning models -- those that power technologies like image and voice recognition -- directly on resource-constrained devices like phones, IoT products, and even a $5 Raspberry PI, all without utilizing a data center or network connectivity and while maintaining high levels of privacy and battery-efficient performance. Traditional AI and machine learning requires a graphics processing unit (GPU) to perform huge computations. Xnor.ai enables the same functions, but only requires \"commodity central processing units (CPUs).\" \"There is a big gap between the demands of AI algorithms -- in terms of memory, computation, power -- and what we can do on devices around us,\" explained co-founder Ali Farhadi. \"For example, to tag an image with labels on your phone, you need to send the photo into GPU servers, they will process the image, and get back to you with the tag. Xnor.ai's technology empowers devices around us with the power of AI and enables running complex AI algorithms right on the device.\"  Xnor.ai is led by Farhadi and Mohammad Rastegari, another co-founder. Farhadi, the CEO, is also an assistant professor at the University of Washington Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Rastegari earned his PhD from Dartmouth for computer vision research. They are both part of AI2's \"Project Plato,\" which is \"focused on extracting visual knowledge from images, diagrams, and videos to enrich knowledge bases that are conventionally derived from textual resources.\" The fresh cash will be used to develop Xnor.ai's platform and put its technology into drones, cars, smart cameras, and more. There seem to be numerous potential uses cases for the company's innovation. \"Our goal is to make all devices around us smarter,\" Farhadi said. \"Anywhere that requires running AI on the edge is where our technology becomes a key player. It enables new AI-powered apps on phones, handheld devices, wearable devices, AR, VR, drones, automotive, etc.\"  In a statement, Madrona Managing Director Matt McIlwain noted that technology like Amazon Echo's voice recognition and Facebook's image recognition are powered by \"a solid connection to the cloud and intensive GPU data farms enabling up.\" \"Imagine what is possible if that style of computing could be done on the device in your hand, on your wrist, or in your car,\" he noted. \"We believe the future of AI will rest on creating systems that combine the value of core and edge device learning. We are excited to work with Ali and Mohammad on building Xnor.ai.\" Oren Etzioni, head of AI2, said Xnor.ai has found a \"remarkable technological breakthrough.\" He told GeekWire that the \"sky is the limit\" for how Xnor.ai's technology can be used to empower commodity devices with AI and have \"significant impact in industry and in our everyday life.\" \"Its technology is the basis for a revolution in the use of deep learning and machine vision on devices like phones, HoloLens, cameras, and other devices,\" Etzioni added. \"It supports increased battery life, strong privacy (data stays on the device), and disconnected use (the device doesn't have to connect to the internet).\" Asked about more spin-offs from AI2, Etzioni said \"there will be more in the coming years.\" Seattle is becoming an epicenter for machine learning and artificial intelligence, with many local startups like Xnor.ai launching in the past few years, along with tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon developing their own related technologies. \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Tim Prouty speaks at the GeekWire Summit. (GeekWire photo)\n Convoy is putting a little more gas in the tank. The Seattle startup, which matches trucking companies with shippers that need to move freight, has hired Uber's former Seattle Software Engineering chief Tim Prouty as head of engineering. Obviously, there are interesting parallels to the work Prouty performed at Uber, and those at Convoy, which sometimes gets described as the \"Uber of trucking.\" Prouty opened Uber's engineering office in Seattle in 2015, growing that office to more than 150. A University of Washington Computer Science & Engineering alum, Prouty served as director of engineering at EMC's Isilon Storage Division prior to Uber. \"Tim founded Uber's Seattle engineering office and drove growth from zero to 150+ people in 18 months, and we're excited for him to help us take on extreme growth at Convoy as well,\" said Convoy co-founder and CTO Grant Goodale in an email to GeekWire. Convoy now employs 85 people, and it is moving to a new 20,000 square office space in March. That marks the company's 7th move in two years. Goodale said that they continue to attract top talent from companies like Uber, Amazon and Google. \"Tim saw an opportunity to build the world's best engineering team headquartered here in Seattle, tackling an enormous $800 billion opportunity with potential global impact,\" said Goodale. Added Prouty: \"I couldn't be more excited to join the world-class Convoy team and contribute to building a transformative company here in Seattle.\" The hiring of Prouty is a big shot in the arm for Convoy, which is one of Seattle's fastest-growing and hottest startups. The company was chosen as a Seattle 10 finalist at last year's GeekWire Gala, recognizing up-and-coming Seattle area startups. Last year, the company pulled in $16 million in venture capital from Greylock, Jeff Bezos' venture capital firm Bezos Expeditions, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, eBay Motors founder Simon Rothman and Code.org co-founder Hadi Partovi. Convoy is led by CEO Dan Lewis, who previously served as general manager of new shopping experiences at Amazon. In an interview with GeekWire last year, we asked Lewis about the parallels between Convoy and Uber, and here's what he said. The biggest parallel, I think, is that Uber made it lower cost and higher service levels by using technology. I think that, when we think about this business, that is the most important thing we can do. We can actually increase the service levels. We can make it easier for truckers to get more work. We can make it easier for shippers to have trucks on short notice, and know where their trucks are, which is something they don't usually know today. We can actually offer those better levels of service for a lower price. That's what Uber did. The other thing is -- a big difference, I would say -- is that Uber had to essentially go out there and build all their capacity. They had to go get people to drive cars. They had to set up this whole system that didn't really exist before. One of the things that's really nice, in our world, is that we're working with existing trucking companies. These guys are already out there running two or three trucks, trying to grow their business, and they're looking for work. We can sign up a lot of these entrepreneurs and get them more work without having to sort of go build that from scratch. ",

      "content": "(BigStock Photo).\n Well, that was fast. The Trump administration has reportedly set the wheels in motion to undo former President Obama's plan to help immigrant entrepreneurs build startups in the U.S., just three weeks after the provision was finalized. Last summer, Obama instructed the Department of Homeland Security to create an \"International Entrepreneur Rule\" that would allow immigrants to grow startups in the U.S. for up to five years, provided the company meets certain benchmarks of success, like capital investments and job creation. The rule was proposed as a workaround for foreign entrepreneurs because there isn't currently a good avenue for business leaders from other countries to build companies in the U.S. Work visas, like the H-1B, only apply to skilled employees, not startup founders. In a draft executive order obtained by Bloomberg News, the Trump administration pledges to \"clarify that parole may never be used to circumvent statutory immigration policy or admit into the United States entire classes of foreign nationals who do not qualify for admission under existing immigration categories; and immediately terminate all existing parole policies, guidance, and programs that do not comport\" with current immigration law. The draft later proposes regulating and reforming the \"treaty investor visa category for foreign entrepreneurs so that activity allowed for such entrepreneurs conforms to the requirements of the immigration laws.\" It's important to note that the leaked draft is just that, and the Trump administration hasn't confirmed if or when it will be executed. Without intervention, the International Entrepreneur Rule will take effect July 17. \"Any real businessman should see the economic merits of this rule,\" Seattle immigration attorney Tahmina Watson told GeekWire shortly after Trump's election. \"If he truly cares about the economy, he should leave the rule alone.\" The leaked draft is creating a swell of anxiety in the technology community. In addition to overturning the entrepreneur parole option, it also seeks to overhaul the current work-visa program, which big tech companies use to recruit talent from overseas. \"In America, we educate some of the brightest minds in the world at our universities,\" said Michael Schutzler, CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association. \"Yet, we've been deporting them to start their companies in other countries. This recent parole policy changed that ridiculous aspect of our current laws. Why would we cut off this American job creation pipeline?\" Accolade CEO Rajeev Singh, a child of immigrants, a key member of the Seattle tech community, and co-founder of Concur, expressed his frustration with the current political climate in an interview for an upcoming episode of the GeekWire Podcast. \"Our industry is fueled by the most brilliant brains around the planet, and they don't all necessarily come from the United States,\" Singh said. \"They come from all over the world and so our capacity to maintain a leadership level in innovation is required in order to be able to access the most brilliant brains around the world.\" Tech companies, like Microsoft, Amazon, and Expedia, have thrown their weight behind Washington state's lawsuit over the executive order, outlining how Trump's immigration policy is detrimental to their business. The programs outlined in the draft are in line with Trump's executive actions on immigration from over the weekend, which bar immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for the next few weeks. The Trump administration says the temporary ban will help officials study immigration policy and prevent terrorists from entering the U.S. ",

      "content": "StratusCore CEO Denise Muyco. Photo via StratusCore.\n StratusCore, a 5-year-old Seattle-based startup that helps digital content creators with cloud-based production technology, is finally coming out of stealth mode. The company has stayed quiet for the past several years but is now revealing details about its business and platform that is used by giants like Netflix, Sony, and more than 45,000 artists around the globe. StratusCore offers a full suite of digital production tools for content creators that need help with editing, rendering, transferring, managing, and storing large media files both in the company's own private cloud and on top of services like AWS and Azure. The company prides itself on its technology that provides high security and low latency, particularly given the increasing amount of data and computation required for these processes. The platform is a one-stop shop for creatives, but also acts as an a la carte menu that allows users to pay on-demand for which services they need. Denise Muyco and David D'Andrea co-founded StratusCore in 2010. Before the company launched, Muyco was in Vancouver, B.C., where she was recruited by Steve Arnold to help run a media production studio that focused on rendering technology. Arnold is well-known in the media and entertainment world, having worked with George Lucas as an executive at Lucasfilm in the 1980s before being recruited by Bill Gates to lead a startup that Microsoft later acquired. Arnold then co-founded the George Lucas Educational Foundation and launched venture capital firm Polaris Partners in 1996. Arnold originally set up the Vancouver studio to run like a co-op, but Muyco convinced him to turn it into an actual company which eventually evolved into StratusCore. With Arnold helping as an active advisor, the startup expanded beyond a rendering service into the full suite of products it offers today. \"I have been observing StratusCore's progress for six years, watching both the cloud applications evolve and the media and entertainment industry accept StratusCore's platform as the new operating system for digital production,\" Arnold said in a statement.  StratusCore is used by many small production companies and freelancers who are hired by giants like Sony and Netflix to help create shows, games, animations, and more. It also partners with content creation toolmakers like AutoDesk, The Foundry, NVIDIA, and Chaos Group to provide more options for users.    Muyco said that StratusCore separates itself from competitors because it offers such a wide range of services that are available on-demand and in the cloud, removing the need for customers to purchase expensive hardware or software licenses. It's similar to the gaming cloud service that NVIDIA announced at CES earlier this month that essentially turns any PC or Mac into a high-powered gaming computer. \"You can use as much or little of the services as you want,\" Muyco noted. The CEO also said that StratusCore wants to take advantage of all the metadata it collects on different customers and projects to help optimize its platform. She envisions creating a marketplace almost like \"an Expedia for digital production\" that helps artists and studios figure out how to most efficiently produce content. \"Overall it's about getting people started with digital content creation and production with a low cost of entry,\" Muyco said. The company is not revealing its angel investors or total funding, but it has \"raised several million to date\" and is exploring an official investment round during 2017. Public SEC filings show more than $3.5 million raised since 2013. StratusCore employs 20 people and is hiring for several positions at its offices in Seattle and Vancouver. ",

Portland business leaders Mara Zepeda, Paige Hendrix Buckner, and Genevieve LeMarchal were sitting around the kitchen table discussing a familiar topic. They met regularly to talk about sales strategies for growing their companies. The conversation always came back to funding and how a lack of access often prevented women from becoming entrepreneurs. Despite their success in business, women kept facing rejection from venture capital firms and lenders. \"The women decided that they could do something about it,\" said Robin Klemm, a longtime angel investor and technology consultant. Shortly after that meeting in the kitchen, the entrepreneurs approached Klemm with their idea: They wanted to start a fund that would help women get access to critical debt financing and they wanted Klemm to be executive director. Together, with fellow entrepreneurs Astrid Scholz and Jill Nelson, they launched XXcelerate Fund to help female founders access the capital they need to get their businesses off the ground. \"Women receive only 3 percent of venture capital and 5 percent of small business loans,\" said Klemm. \"Yet, this gap in access to capital is happening at a time when we see continuing proof points of the effectiveness of women business leaders. Men continue to have loads of options when starting a business. It is time to extend equal opportunities to capital for women entrepreneurs.\" XXcelerate is currently seeking capital in the form of loan funds and grants through government entities, foundations, businesses, and individuals. The fund has already secured capacity-building cash from the Portland Development Commission. Once the fund reaches its initial goal of $500,000, XXcelerate will name its first recipient. XXcelerate will also help recipients of its loans with financial education, sales guidance, mentorship, and peer support. The fund is now accepting applications from Oregon businesses, led by women, with a demonstrated market fit and established customer base. \"The XXcelerate Fund board imagines a world where funding women entrepreneurs is the norm, not the exception, and where more women-owned businesses are bankable, investable, or independent,\" said Klemm. \"We have to start somewhere and a fund dedicated to women is a good place to focus.\" ",

      "content": "UW researchers have generated Passive Wi-Fi transmissions that use 10,000 times less power than current methods. (Credit: UW via YouTube)\n A group of University of Washington engineers has raised capital to develop and commercialize a power-efficient way to generate WiFi transmissions. Jeeva Wireless just reeled in a $1.2 million round, co-founder Shyamnath Gollakota confirmed with GeekWire. He declined to provide more details about the cash and how Jeeva will use it, as the Seattle startup is still in stealth mode. The company's co-founders are the same UW researchers who co-authored a study last year for a Passive Wi-Fi system that can generate WiFi transmissions using 10,000 times less power than conventional methods. Not even low-power options such as Bluetooth Low Energy and Zigbee can match the system's energy efficiency, based on the study that earned the UW team a place on MIT Technology Review's top-ten list of breakthrough technologies in 2016. With the fresh funding, it appears that the company is ready to commercialize its innovation. Other co-founders include Joshua Smith, a UW associate professor of computer science and engineering and of electrical engineering; Aaron Parks, a graduate researcher at the UW's Sensor Systems Laboratory; Bryce Kellogg, a graduate researcher at the UW's Mobile Systems Lab; and Vamsi Talla, a research associate at the UW computer science and engineering school. Gollakota, the other co-founder, was named to Forbes' 30 under 30 list for 2017. Also listed on the SEC filing for the investment as a director is Easen Ho, an executive at Vantron Technology, a Silicon Valley-based provider of low-power embedded systems. Passive WiFi could open the way for applications that currently require too much power for regular WiFi, according to a UW news release from last year. For example, other types of communication platforms have been required in the past for smart-home sensor systems that can detect which doors are open, or whether the kids have come home from school. \"Even though so many homes already have Wi-Fi, it hasn't been the best choice for that,\" Smith said in the release. \"Now that we can achieve Wi-Fi for tens of microwatts of power and can do much better than both Bluetooth and ZigBee, you could now imagine using Wi-Fi for everything.\" The researchers could rev up Passive Wi-Fi to transmit standard signals at bit rates of up to 11 megabits per second, which isn't as fast as the maximum rate for standard Wi-Fi but is 11 times faster than Bluetooth 1.0. The secret to revving up the rate while cranking down the power has to do with digital vs. analog. The system developed by Smith and his colleagues uses a single plugged-in device for power-intensive analog functions, such as producing a radio signal at a specific frequency. A separate array of sensors produces the Wi-Fi packets of information by reflecting and absorbing the signal, using digital switches that require virtually no energy. Prototype sensors could connect with a smartphone, tablet, or other device at distances of up to 100 feet. \"With Passive Wi-Fi, we can envision a true 'Internet of Things' in which household devices and wearable sensors will be able to communicate using Wi-Fi without worrying about power,\" the researchers note in the description from the video below.  \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Here comes another round of Techstars Seattle startups. The 3-month accelerator announced its 2017 cohort on Thursday. The group, which marks the eighth overall for Techstars Seattle, includes nine companies working in various industries ranging from e-commerce to biotech. The entrepreneurs began work this week and will participate in a Demo Day on April 19. Here they are, with descriptions from each startup: Techstars Seattle Managing Director Chris Devore penned a blog post today titled \"What is Seattle best at\" that detailed how Techstars Seattle picked the 2017 class. It examined a variety of core areas and emerging areas -- enterprise software-as-a-service; cloud infrastructure and developer productivity; e-commerce and marketplaces; biopharma and wellness; energy transmission and trading; space and aerospace; and the \"AI stack\" -- when selecting the startups. Devore described these categories as \"the vectors of innovation where Seattle can compete and win in the global market for ideas, people and money.\" He said Techstars Seattle looked at \"powerful pairings of founder capabilities and ecosystem resources\" that give companies unfair competitive advantages. \"As an innovation ecosystem, Seattle competes globally for talent and capital,\" he wrote. \"With the world's biggest and best-known innovation market just two hours away by air, we need to be crystal clear about the places we can not only win the occasional competition against a Bay Area challenger, but lean into opportunities where we consistently, systematically outperform that market and earn the attention of the world's most talented makers and investors. When we get that right, amazing things happen for entrepreneurs and the investors who back them.\" Since 2010, the 71 companies that went through Techstars Seattle have collectively raised more than $350 million, Devore noted. The most recent Techstars Seattle class was perhaps the most impressive yet, with several companies landing funding rounds after Demo Day. Four of the rounds were led by venture capital firms from Seattle, the Bay Area, and New York like Madrona Venture Group, DFJ, IA Ventures, and others. One startup, Beam, was already acquired by Microsoft. Some of that success is due to tweaks Devore made after taking over as managing director in early 2015 and raising a fresh $2.7 million fund in early 2015. Devore, also general partner at the Founder's Co-op venture firm, restructured the organization and brought in more mentors from the Seattle startup community. However, TechStars Seattle is still awaiting a big breakout success. Seattle-area startups and graduates such as Remitly, Apptentive, Bizible and Shippable have raised money and grown, but the program has yet to produce a blockbuster exit that really could catapult the organization to new heights. The Beam acquisition by Microsoft was certainly notable from the most recent class, which has other startups poised for growth. Entrepreneurs who are accepted into a Techstars program -- the organization runs accelerators across the globe -- get up to $20,000 in seed funding in exchange for 6 percent common stock and the chance to participate in a three-month immersive startup experience. That includes extensive mentoring by a group of experienced entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Techstars Seattle is based at the University of Washington's Startup Hall, where another accelerator run by Techstars in partnership with Amazon's Alexa team will host its first cohort in July. Other startup accelerators in Seattle include Fledge, Ivy Softworks, Microsoft Ventures, and many more. ",

(Give InKind Photo).\n Three years ago, Laura Malcolm and James Kocsis received the heartbreaking news that they were part of the one in five expectant parents whose pregnancies ended in a miscarriage. But unlike many of those similarly situated, Malcolm and Kocsis both had years of experience in the technology industry. In the weeks following the traumatic stillbirth of their first child, the married couple started exploring the idea for a project that would leverage their skills and help others who found themselves in unexpected crises. That was the inspiration for Give InKind, a startup based in Tacoma, Wash. that helps people send gifts and services to loved ones in need. \"We have set out to change the way people give support during a time of need, to make it possible for anyone to send the meals or help that is what people actually want to receive during crisis,\" said Malcolm. \"Crowdfunding is popular because it's easy, not because people necessarily find money the most helpful.\" Give InKind has libraries of gifts it suggests for different scenarios a loved one might be facing. The \"End of Life/Hospice Care\" section, for example, has a Kindle E-reader, grocery and spa gift cards, and a house-cleaning service. The website also has articles and resources for people dealing with difficult circumstances. Give InKind shares the revenue generated from its recommendations with the suppliers. Malcolm shared Give InKind's story for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for her answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"We make it possible to give the help that's actually needed during a time of crisis, whether you are near or far.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"Our first child was unexpectedly stillborn -- and that inspiration hit us like a ton of bricks. We saw our friends and family struggling to know how to help us from around the country. In particular, family members reporting they were calling every Whole Foods in our L.A. neighborhood trying to figure out who could deliver us groceries, friends who said they spent hours researching something more thoughtful than flowers to send, aunts who wished they were closer to come over and do our dishes or cook us dinner. But did we know a service they could order from? The platforms they were attempting to use (Meal Train, GoFundMe) didn't work for them, and we knew there was a better way.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Bootstrap to this point, just starting our conversations with angels. Why'd we bootstrap? Because we drank our own Kool-Aid and made money the first week we were live and that was enough motivation to keep going!\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Using affiliate e-commerce in a new way -- it's been around for so long and very few companies are still taking advantage of it. Even more so, the new on-demand and subscription based services have higher revenue shares than traditional affiliate programs, so our ability to say, 'Friend having cancer treatment? Send a week of dinners via Home Chef!' drives us an $18 share on a $60 gift purchase. Or send a housecleaner from Cleanify to your friend who just had surgery -- 10 percent revenue share on that gift.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Recognizing a B2B use for our platform as soon as it happened, and directing some resources to grow that side immediately. We had someone create a Give InKind page with a wishlist for Standing Rock donations. She received enough donations in three weeks to drive $100 revenue for Give InKind so we immediately began reaching out to non-profits to see if we could put their in-kind donation needs online. Turns out, that's a major pain-point for them and we can help streamline their donations using our platform as it stands -- so we're currently testing that side of the business and onboarding 10 non-profits per week onto the platform.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Spending money on PR, too early. We've found the best PR has come from our own connections and founder outreach --we landed on the cover of the Tacoma News Tribune on Thanksgiving Day from my own pitching and I realized no one can tell your story like you can. Don't doubt that!\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Zuck and Priscilla -- because, honestly, they have felt the pain of our shared experience and the power of communities to come together in a time of need. They heard the response from loved ones wanting to help. They saw the comments on their Facebook posts of people offering advice, sharing stories, suggesting books. We do all of that on Give InKind and would have been a great resource to add to their arsenal.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Right now, we're almost entirely co-located so it's been a while since we did a team building activity. And as married co-founders ... oh, who am I kidding? We work day and night.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"A real understanding of the weight of the situations we are covering. A true belief in the ability of Give InKind to impact lives in a tremendously helpful way.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"MVP. MVP. MVP. MVP. Can you launch a single feature of your product to iterate on and drive revenue while you build the rest? For example, we have thousands of curated e-commerce products on the site spanning 30 different life situations that you might want to understand the right thing to send for -- we should have launched the totally viable e-commerce portion while we built the rest of the platform. MVP. Did I mention MVP?\" ",

A week later, Kataoka told her she wanted to use the platform to create a piece of interactive political art. \"It drastically accelerated my timeline for putting this out in the world but it was such a cool opportunity, so timely with everything that's happening in the political arena, with social advocacy, that I really couldn't pass it up,\" said Welkhoff. On Thursday, ConveneVR (in partnership with Kataoka) will host its first event -- a gathering of female leaders from across the country held entirely in virtual reality. The women will wear VR headsets, and video of what they see and discuss will be streamed live online. Kataoka, who is known for her radical vision and use of cutting edge technology, is debuting a virtual reality \"sculpture\" during the event based on her existing work, \"Now is the Time.\" That piece, a print highlighting historic \"firsts\" for women, was popularized by the Hillary Clinton campaign. Kataoka featured the work at the Democratic National Convention. Kataoka transformed the two-dimensional image into a 20-foot, 3D virtual reality sculpture. The new piece is called \"Yes! Now is the Time.\" Women attending the ConveneVR event will be able to walk around the piece and read historic firsts and future firsts for women. The piece is interactive. Anyone can add achievements from women in their lives on the \"Yes! Now is the Time\" website. Even though her company is in its nascence, Welkhoff found the idea irresistible. Advancing women, particularly in industries where they've historically faced barriers, is one of the reasons she got into VR in the first place. Welkhoff is president of Seattle Women in Technology and a vocal advocate for gender equity. She believes that VR has the potential to be more gender balanced than other industries because it's a new frontier. \"I think there's a really interesting and unique opportunity in AR and VR to create something really different,\" she said. \"We're not starting with a blank canvas, by any means, but there aren't the same kinds of legacy issues that come into play in a lot of other industry spaces. There's a lot of energy in the world right now around building inclusive spaces, so I think there's just a great window for building a different foundation and that could have a long-term, really exciting effect in what VR looks like in the next 10, 20 years.\" Welkhoff has been a fixture in the Seattle startup community for years. In addition to her outreach with organizations like Seattle Women in Tech and Up Global, she founded Zealyst in 2010 to help businesses strengthen relationships among their employees. In November, she sold the product to the University of Washington's Center for Leadership and Strategic Thinking at the Foster School of Business. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. UW is using a modified version of Zealyst to help students collaborate with one another. It's the first time the university has acquired intellectual property of this nature, according to Welkhoff. She is still serving in an advisory capacity for the UW's Zealyst program but is now focused full-time on ConveneVR. Right now, ConveneVR's is acting as a facilitator and organizer of virtual events. The startup is partnering with PlutoVR and BigBoxVR to provide the technology to pull off the \"Yes! Now is the Time\" event. Eventually, ConveneVR will build an end-to-end product but Welkhoff thinks if she tried to do that today \"the likelihood of failure would be high.\" Welkhoff's long-term strategy for ConveneVR goes beyond virtual events and social advocacy. She thinks corporations could use the product to replace conference calls and supplement business travel. It's not an easy space to break into, as another Seattle VR startup learned. Earlier this month, venture-backed enterprise VR startup EnvelopVR abruptly shut down. The startup's CEO told GeekWire the market just wasn't ready for the kind of VR business products they were offering. \"I think that's a huge risk right now and it's a big part of being early and being a pioneer in the space,\" said Welkhoff. \"I think we're going to see a lot of that over the next few years, quite honestly. Everyone's placing bets right now on what the market's going to look like. How it's going to develop over time. There's a huge margin for error there, particularly as the world seems to be increasingly volatile, so it is concerning but I don't think it's a reason to stop taking those risks and to stop innovating.\" The \"Yes! Now is the Time\" live stream will be available here on Thursday, Jan. 26, at 12:30 p.m. PST. ",

(Pavia Photo)\n Pavia Systems, a Seattle-based startup developing software that supports infrastructure construction projects, has announced a $4 million funding round to accelerate deployment of its flagship product HeadLight. The round was led by San Francisco-based Eileses Capital, and follows a $3 million round in 2015. HeadLight -- or the HeadLight Project Intelligence platform -- is a network of mobile and desktop applications that allow workers to speed up data collection from construction sites by submitting daily reports, documenting projects with on-site photographs and video, and providing real-time project updates. Pavia CEO and co-founder George White told GeekWire in a previous interview that, prior to using HeadLight, many infrastructure construction projects were documented in the field on paper and entered into forms by hand at a base office. \"Now they use our software to capture all that field info and automatically create documentation they need from the job site,\" White said at the time. The new tools could be a boon to projects that will likely increase across the country as President Trump acts on his plans to improve and update the country's infrastructure. In 2015, Pavia inked a deal with the Washington State Department of Transportation, which has been using the startup's software for high-profile projects like the SR-520 Floating Bridge and the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel. According to a press release announcing the new funding, Pavia's software is now being used in projects in seven states, including Washington, Texas and Illinois. New HeadLight applications are planned for release in 2017 for pay items management, advanced reporting, dashboard analytics and integrations. \"We are entering a very exciting era of technology use in the way we build our infrastructure, and as we continue to grow as an organization, we are thrilled to have Eileses Capital join in as an investor and strategic advisor. The experience that the partners at Eileses bring in scaling successful SaaS companies with business models very similar to our own makes them a valuable partner,\" White said in the release. Pavia was spun out of the University of Washington in 2005 by White, Si Katara, Joe Mahoney, and Steven Muench. ",

      "content": "(Crowd Cow Photo)\n Talk about seed and feed. Crowd Cow, the Seattle-based startup that launched in 2015 with the goal of bringing higher-quality beef to more meat lovers, announced Tuesday that it has secured $2 million in seed funding and plans to scale its operations in order to feed a national audience. The round was led by Fuel Capital, and also includes investments from Maveron Capital, Zulily founders Mark Vadon and Darrell Cavens, ex-NFL star Joe Montana, and several other individual investors. Crowd Cow was founded by Joe Heitzeberg (founder of Snapvine and Poppy) and Ethan Lowry (founder of Urbanspoon and Poppy) and set itself apart from traditional butchers and grocers by giving consumers access to beef from a single steer, raised humanely by Northwest ranchers. Using crowdfunding tactics, Crowd Cow shoppers could shop for quantities they desired and have the meat shipped directly to them. \"We spent a good portion of 2016 testing the concept of crowdfunding beef, which included everything from seeing if we could find reliable rancher relationships to seeing if customers would bite on the idea itself,\" Heitzeberg told GeekWire. \"We now have several fantastic ranch partners here in the Pacific Northwest, and working with them has given us a strong foundation for how to enter into new relationships.\" Heitzeberg also said that on the customer side, he and Lowry determined that they could sell out a whole steer in just a few hours. They gained the confidence to start offering additional steers from assorted ranches in just one day, and it taught them how to offer customers greater variety. \"This early success has left us with a waiting list of customers who would love to buy from Crowd Cow, but can't because we are unable to serve their region just yet,\" Heitzeberg said. \"It's the main reason for us to seek out funding. We're ready to go fully national and the additional financial resources will let us do that much more quickly than if we continued to bootstrap.\" Crowd Cow aims to be a marketplace connecting consumers with ranchers. \"While other companies will sell you beef, we think it's critical to know where you beef comes from and how it was raised,\" Lowry said in a news release. \"That means finding ranchers who spend their lives following only the best cattle-raising practices, and supporting their work by giving them a new outlet to sell to consumers.\" Heitzeberg said that the young company is excited about the investors that they've brought on board. \"Playing in the consumer space, we wanted to build a group of advisors who we could turn to as we tackle user acquisition and retention challenges,\" Heitzeberg said. \"Having Zulily founders Mark and Darrell on board is going to be a huge benefit as we aim to scale quickly. Between their experience at Blue Nile and Zulilly, we have some incredible heads we can pick for ideas and guidance. \"Fuel and Maveron Capital both have great track records when funding early stage companies and we knew they'd be great partners as we're building up,\" he added. Montana, the legendary San Francisco 49ers quarterback, is managing partner of Liquid 2 Ventures, a venture capital firm which raised a $25 million fund in 2015. Crowd Cow told GeekWire last fall that the business was growing rapidly and delivery to all of the West Coast was just the start before going after a much larger audience. \"We're looking to build out our core leadership team right now, which includes marketing, operations, and development,\" Heitzeberg said when asked what the $2 million will target. \"Crowd Cow is playing in an interesting space that intersects e-commerce and technology innovation with traditional branding and offline operations. Our incoming team will help us bridge these sectors so that we can hit national reach this year.\" ",

Samepage Health has acquired Health123, a Seattle-based startup that launched in 2011 and created a healthcare intelligence management platform. Founded by University of Washington professor Paul Ciechanowski, Samepage has been around for several years and sells online tools to help professionals treat patients with multiple behavior health and medical conditions. The idea is to reduce money that delivery networks, medical groups and payers spend on complex chronic patients, while improving the quality of the care. Now Samepage will utilize Health123's platform. Health123 co-founder Rebecca Norlander, a former Microsoft executive, is now CEO of Samepage. Her two colleagues, CTO Walt Jones and COO Rachel Lanham, will also join the company, which will employ around 10 people after the acquisition. Norlander said the Health123 platform can be a \"force multiplier\" for Samepage's existing Samepage Method product, which is used by clients like Mayo Clinic, NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation, and Trinity Health. \"Samepage has built a vibrant services-based business, but wants to take it to the next level with technology to create the one-two punch of services powered by scalable platform technologies -- that's where Health123 comes in,\" Norlander told GeekWire. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. \"We are thrilled to welcome Health123's talented and innovative leadership and personnel to join the Samepage team,\" Ciechanowski said in a statement. \"By leveraging their proven platform, we will be able to bring our successful solution to more customers quickly, and more deeply engage patients on their terms while better supporting clinicians.\" ",

A Jan. 13 court filing in King County Superior Court, signed by lawyers for both companies, says that \"all claims against all parties in this action have been resolved,\" and all hearings in the case have been cancelled. Financial terms of the settlement were not disclosed in the court record. Both companies are based in Bellevue, Wash. \"It's a relief to have the case behind us so that we can focus on the year ahead,\" said PetHub CEO Tom Arnold in response to GeekWire's inquiry. \"I wish Pebblebee only the best.\" Pebblebee CEO Daniel Daoura declined to comment. According to PetHub's complaint, the dispute dated back to July 2014, when PetHub announced the PetHub Signal electronic ID tag after signing a deal with Pebblebee to develop the tags. PetHub alleged that Pebblebee didn't live up to the terms of their agreement, and marketed a competing product in violation of their deal. In previous court filings, Pebblebee denied the allegations and filed its own breach of contract claim against PetHub. PetHub alleged that the tracking tag's battery drained after two weeks, rather than the promised one year. The suit also claimed that the software on the tag didn't work properly, and the promised smartphone application wasn't developed according to the requirements of the contract. In a court filing, Pebblebee acknowledged that \"it advised PetHub that the batteries for the first order of pilot tracking tags depleted too quickly,\" but said that Pebblebee \"promptly corrected this issue within two months and before PetHub ordered any more tags.\" In addition, Pebblebee denied in court filings that its own \"Honey\" device competed with the product that was jointly developed by the two companies.

Just like any business, being able to track and monitor sales of individual products -- from the popular to the unpopular -- is an advantage for any shop owner who wants to improve their bottom line. That's where Headset wants to help. The Seattle-based startup just reeled in a $2.5 million round from Hypur Ventures, Salveo Capital, and Poseidon Asset Management for its marijuana retail business intelligence platform. Headset's software shows users sell-through data, promotion effectiveness, top-performing products, and more in real-time. It also offers insights into market intelligence; the platform is a market research and analysis tool similar to Nielsen, NPD or IRi, but for marijuana retailers and dispensaries. Headset's 177 customers range from cannabis brands, retailers, dispensaries, investors, media companies, and consulting firms across Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and California, as well as some international clients. Founded in 2015, the 10-person company has raised $3.3 million to date. Cy Scott, Brian Wansolich, and Scott Vickers are the founders of Headset. The trio previously co-founded Leafly, the popular marijuana strain and dispensary resource platform that was acquired by Seattle-based marijuana investment firm Privateer Holdings in 2011.

FlexMinder CEO Lowell Ricklefs told GeekWire that his company's existing business and team, which currently consists of fewer than 20 employees, will continue to grow while its technology powers future Jellyvision products. Jellyvision, a Chicago-based employee communication platform, plans to expand its new Seattle office with up to 100 people. Ricklefs joined FlexMinder in 2011 shortly after Deepak Kumar and Will Miceli started the company and took it through the Techstars program in Seattle, before raising a $1.2 million Series A round in 2014. FlexMinder aggregates the reimbursement process for healthcare flexible spending accounts, which allow employees to save money by putting pretax dollars aside to be spent on qualified items such as insurance deductibles, co-pays at the doctor, prescription drugs and more. The company's software also lets individual customers see their healthcare claim information via a single portal. It currently serves more than 2,500 clients.  \"We came to the conclusion that we could grow more quickly by merging with a company with a much larger existing market presence,\" Ricklefs said. Jellyvision, which employs 300, will incorporate FlexMinder's products into its own platform known as ALEX. \"We believe that FlexMinder's capabilities will help make our service even more useful to people by enabling them to easily view and understand their benefits and claims activity,\" Jellyvision CEO Amanda Lannert said in a statement. \"In many cases, people leave free money on the table every year due to the need to follow laborious process. By introducing FlexMinder's capabilities to our existing platform, we look to make a difference by putting money back into people's wallets.\" Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

      "content": "Camp Native employees on a team-building hike in Spearfish. (Camp Native Photo)\n Camp Native CEO David Woodbury describes Spearfish, S.D., as a place with \"the least amount of tech startup activity in the country.\" So why did he leave the booming tech ecosystem of Seattle to build his startup there? The answer is simple. It made good financial sense. Camp Native is an online marketplace for searching and booking outdoor accommodations, like campsites and yurts. The startup drives business using a telemarketing approach, one that benefits from a larger team of workers. Woodbury started considering locations where he could get more hiring bang for his buck. He wanted to find a place with a strong outdoor community, where Camp Native would be a good fit. Spearfish kept coming up. He reached out to the Spearfish Office of Economic Development, which was unsurprisingly eager to have a growing tech company set up shop. The department offered up a $25,000 investment and one of its board members came on as an angel investor, participating in the startup's seed round. By October 2015, Camp Native was officially a Spearfish company. \"It's really paid off,\" said Woodbury. \"We've had no turnover ... we're higher, pretty significantly higher, than the going rate of this type of work. In a market like Seattle, or really any major market, the wage that we pay would be, maybe, considered on the low end. That was really the motivating factor, to extend the resources, get more impact of the investment that we had been able to generate.\" Camp Native has raised $1.35 million to date, some of which came from the Spearfish economic office and a local angel. The company is also planning a Series A investment round. Woodbury says the move has been beneficial in a number of ways. Employees get outdoors as much as possible. He and his wife have cut back to one car, and they bike most places. Camp Native has been able to hire more employees and rent a much bigger office space than would be possible in a metropolitan hub. But it hasn't all been easy. Aside from missing great Asian food, Woodbury says he and his team are under \"a bit of a microscope\" in the 12,000-person town. \"Within two months of moving here, I'm the keynote speaker at the Spearfish Economic Development Gala in front of 150 people who've lived here their whole lives ... it can be a little bit intimidating when you think about from that standpoint,\" he said. \"When you live in a city like Seattle you can pretty easily disappear if you'd like to.\" Is a headquarters that far off the grid a disadvantage when courting investors? Woodbury doesn't think so. \"Big investors are starting to seek out entrepreneurs who intentionally do things to decrease burn, to lower cost of operations, but obviously do it in a smart way,\" he said. \"I think the Camp Native model, as far as how we operate this business, is we get a lot of impact for the amount of headcount that we've been able to bring on. We'd probably have half the headcount if we were operating somewhere like Seattle or the Bay Area.\" Camp Native plans to use the Series A cash to grow from 14 employees to 25 to 30. Not everyone on the team will operate out of Spearfish. The company's CTO and SFO stayed back in Seattle. Woodbury thinks it's important to maintain a presence on the West Coast, primarily to secure engineering talent. Before the exodus, Camp Native participated in Seattle's 9Mile Labs startup accelerator. The young startup acquired some accolades here, including top prizes in the Microsoft Lunchbox Pitch Competition and Seattle Angel Conference. That momentum, Woodbury says, has kept conversations with a few dozen investors going, even after the move. Woodbury and his team want to catalyze startup activity in Spearfish. They hosted a Startup Week there and are actively engaging with the community to foster conversations about innovation. \"If you're in Seattle, or the Bay Area, or any of the major tech startup hubs, everybody's striving for these billion dollar valuation companies and here, or any small town around the country, if you built a $10 million tech startup company and created 50 jobs, it's hugely impactful to that community,\" said Woodbury. \"Certainly we've got higher aspirations for Camp Native than that but, hopefully, by us doing this, we're spurring on some innovation from other individuals in the community to start thinking, maybe, a little differently.\" ",

      "content": "James Newell joins Voyager Capital as a partner in their Seattle office. (Voyager Seattle Photo)\n In some ways, James Newell is a hometown Seattle boy. He was born and raised on the Kitsap Peninsula, just an hour's ferry ride from downtown Seattle, and attended the University of Washington on a football scholarship. So when he took a job in San Francisco advising companies on merger and acquisitions, it was supposed to be a temporary move. \"It was only supposed to be two years, I was going to do my quick tour of duty and then return to Seattle. Then two years turned into four, and four turned into ten, and ten turned into almost twelve. And I finally made my return a couple of weeks ago,\" said Newell, who spent eight years investing in startups at Menlo Park, Calif.-based IVP. Now, Newell has returned to the Pacific Northwest to continue startup investing at Voyager Capital, a venture capital firm with offices in Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Portland. Bill McAleer, a founding partner of Voyager, said the addition of an experienced Silicon Valley investor to its Seattle office was part of a purposeful move to place more emphasis on the Pacific Northwest. \"We're very bullish on the Seattle market,\" said McAleer. \"Bringing James on is part of reinforcing our commitment to this market and also shifting most of our investing effort and focus to the Pacific Northwest.\" Four of the last five deals the firm has made have been with Pacific Northwest companies, and McAleer said he's excited about the potential startup scene in the region.  The former Aldus executive said he sees potential for a crop of new startups fueled by tech workers moving to the city to work at engineering centers set up by Silicon Valley tech giants like Facebook and Google. And along with those new startups, Seattle will need a stronger relationship with Silicon Valley. \"In bringing James on we wanted someone who had been deep in Silicon Valley and the relationships he was able to form at one of the top tier firms in the Valley, but also could bring the perspective of what it's like to do business in the Northwest,\" McAlee said. He also pointed out that Newell has strong experience in both of Voyager's areas of expertise, early-stage funding and B2B companies. So what does Newell think of Seattle's startup scene in relation to Silicon Valley? \"I think that, other than just the size of the overall ecosystem, they're probably more similar than different,\" Newell said. \"It's obvious that [Seattle's is] smaller, it's more intimate, it's a little bit more rational, but there's no shortage of the talented people working on really challenging problems.\" Specifically, he said cloud tech is an area that he and Voyager are excited about watching develop in the Seattle area. \"Both AWS and Azure have really made Seattle the center of the universe when it comes to the public cloud, and both of those companies are an absolute magnet for talented people. Any time you have that many smart people working on really hard technical challenges, you end up with a great entrepreneurial ecosystem,\" he said. Voyager's past investments have included Act-On, Bluebox Group and Answer Dash. ",

The software removes names, contact information, and other identifying features from resumes so skills and experience are the only criteria hiring managers see. Unitive will incorporate TalentSonar's blind resume technology with its own software, which helps companies write job descriptions, structure interviews, and use data to make hiring decisions. \"When companies are hiring there are many steps in the process - from defining the role to reviewing resumes to interviewing - that could result in a sub-optimal hiring decision,\" said Loh. \"It's only by addressing all of these steps in the process, can organizations be sure that they are hiring the best person for the role.  The combination of TalentSonar's blind resume review technology with Unitive's hiring platform creates the perfect end-to-end solution so we can ensure that every hire is the best person for the job.\" TalentSonar will remain in Seattle with Loh and Hui Dai staying on. \"Unitive is excited to broaden their reach to Seattle by having an office up here since they know that Seattle companies take diversity and inclusion seriously,\" Loh said.

(Stay Alfred Photo)\n Stay Alfred, a Spokane, Wash. lodging startup that operates short-term rentals out of the downtown neighborhoods of major U.S. cities, just closed a $15 million Series A investment round. CEO Jordan Allen confirmed the investment came from a private equity group in Seattle that prefers not to be named. This is the first time Stay Alfred has raised capital. The startup will use the funds to scale across more cities in the U.S. and launch internationally in about 18 to 24 months. Stay Alfred's goal is to grow from about 350 properties in 12 U.S. cities to more than 4,000 properties around the world. \"We're building nationwide and the reason for the capital is, eventually, an international brand that lies between your consistent hotel stay and this new vacation rental, short-term rental, Airbnb/HomeAway stay,\" said Allen. Stay Alfred's customers are primarily leisure travelers or people who want a hotel experience with the flexibility of a furnished apartment. Allen says patients traveling for medical treatment, with equipment and staff, may prefer a Stay Alfred rental over other lodging. Stay Alfred leases individual units and entire buildings in cities and then rents them out on a short-term basis to travelers. Its team handles the furnishing, cleaning, booking, and customers service for each rental. The result is all the amenities of a furnished apartment with the consistency and customer service of a hotel. \"A hotel room is pretty small and then do you really want to be doing medical stuff in some guy's spare bedroom? It's just kind of weird. There's an undeniable need for what our product is,\" said Allen told GeekWire last summer. Stay Alfred has 72 employees and recently hired several new executives and a marketing team. The Series A cash will help the startup navigate its evolution from a short-term rental company, like Airbnb, to a hybrid that operates more like a hotel. \"We really grew up as a vacation rental company and we're turning into a hospitality company,\" said Allen. \"They're just two different worlds. Hotels have outside sales, where they're attracting group and business travel, and a lot of other types of sales. Vacation rentals really just relied on a couple channels, like Airbnb and VRBO, to bring in the majority of their business. We're really evolving into more of a different hospitality brand, kind of in-between the hotel and vacation rental. Kind of the best of both worlds.\" ",

(Apana Photo)\n Water is becoming increasingly scarce, and a startup based in Bellingham, Wash., has raised $3.5 million to help businesses monitor and cut down on water usage and save money. Using smart sensors, Apana can look at how much water a building uses and spot inefficiencies. Matt Rose, CEO of Apana, called water \"the oil of the 21st century\" due to increasing problems with lack of access to clean water. He said his company helps heavy users like grocery stores, hotels, wineries, breweries, cooling tower users and others become \"stewards of water.\" \"The best way to think about our product is we are sort of a security system for water consumption,\" Rose told GeekWire. \"We collect high-resolution data from our sensors, and then we keep an eye on how a building is consuming water. When we catch wasteful patterns, we identify the waste and provide actionable information to front line people.\" Rose said companies can waste a lot of water through things like small leaks that aren't noticeable until the bill comes. Apana's system, Rose said, gives customers more immediate information to make decisions. Kurita Water Industries of Japan led the Series A round for Apana, and other investors include Element 8 of Seattle, Cowles Co. of Spokane and Urban Innovation Fund of San Francisco. In addition to the funding round, Rose said Apana has landed a couple of new customers: Mister Car Wash and Fetzer Vineyards. Apana's biggest customer is Costco. Rose said the Issaquah-based retail giant cut water usage by more than 20 percent in the buildings using Apana's system. Right now, Apana has 11 employees with two Washington offices in Bellingham and Spokane. Rose said he wants to open a Seattle office in the future, once the company hits its sales goals. In the near term, he expects Apana's headcount to grow by close to 50 percent. Rose comes from a background of software development in the healthcare and defense industries. The company's other co-founder, Frank Burns, has more than 20 years of experience building and maintaining wastewater treatment plants. Rose was brought in to help automate water usage to make it easier to track. \"We noticed most buildings were consuming more water than the levels forecast by the design teams,\" Rose said. \"We had an opportunity with our customers to either build bigger wastewater treatment plants to handle the increase in volume, or help them manage their water consumption in order to get it down to design levels.\" ",

The fast-growing Seattle based online pet sitting and dog walking marketplace is targeting an initial public offering in 2018, CEO Aaron Easterly said on a recent appearance on Jim Cramer's Mad Money show. \"We are not in a hurry. We are really excited about the future opportunity. We are tapping less than one percent of the market right now, so there's a lot of growth ahead of us,\" said Easterly, a former executive at online advertising company aQuantive. \"That being said, we are targeting 2018 for a public offering.\" Easterly said that most dog owners \"hate the idea of taking their dog to a kennel,\" which is creating a tremendous opportunity for Rover, which matches pet owners with nearby pet sitters who are publicly rated by the community. The average cost of a stay in a big city is $45 to $50, and nationwide the cost runs about $30 per night for the pet care. Rover, started by venture capitalist Greg Gottesman as a fun project at a Startup Weekend event, raised $40 million in venture capital last October from Foundry Group, Menlo Ventures and Madrona Venture Group. Total funding now stands at $91.5 million. It now boasts more than 65,000 pet sitters on the platform. The company, which we ran into at CES earlier this month, was also mentioned as one of seven possible companies from Washington state that could test the IPO waters in 2017, according to CB Insights. \"While this may be our last round before a public offering, there is nothing about where we are at that makes me think we are maturing as a business in terms of seeing growth slow down, or that we've somehow reached our potential,\" Easterly said in October. During the first half of 2016, Rover announced that it surpassed an annual run rate of $100 million in gross billings. Total revenue for the period grew by around 3X from 2015, Easterly said. In the interview with Jim Cramer, Easterly called Rover a \"tech business at heart.\" \"Ultimately, we are a data business,\" he said. At least one person appears to be excited for Rover's possible IPO. As the interview concluded, Cramer told his audience: \"Private company, but, boy would the stock market love this one.\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

It was in 2010, during a major snowstorm at his home in the Colorado mountains, and he was too distracted by intermittent power outages to give serious attention to an investment pitch from a fitness tracking startup. \"Pretty much my entire goal during that call was to get off the phone,\" Feld recalls. \"I wasn't in any sort of headset or mindset about investing. I was interested in the idea of human-computer interaction, but I hadn't really processed this notion of what a Fitbit was, or why I would want to instrument myself yet. We were just at the very beginning of that thought process.\" So he passed. But nine months later, Feld heard from his fellow investors Jeff Clavier of SoftTech and Jon Callaghan of True Ventures, urging him to take a serious look at Fitbit again. Clavier sent Feld an email that basically read, \"Brad, don't be f--ing stupid, you need to pay attention to this,\" as Feld recalled. When Feld continued to express ambivalence about the investment, Clavier forwarded the same email again and told him to save it. Feld, who had been using a Fitbit in the meantime, relented. His firm, Foundry Group, ended up leading a $9 million Series B investment in Fitbit with SoftTech and True Ventures in 2010, and continued to invest more after that. When Fitbit went public in 2015, Foundry Group's 28.9 percent stake was reportedly worth nearly $1.6 billion. Just recently, Feld said, Clavier forwarded him the same email again about another company that Feld is now going to invest in. He refers to it now as the \"Fitbit f--cking stupid email,\" Feld said. Feld called it a testament to Fitbit having \"great early stage investors who were patient and supportive,\" and willing to assert themselves selectively to drum up support from other investors. Feld, the Techstars and Foundry Group co-founder, told the story last week during a conversation with Park at CES in Las Vegas. They talked about Fitbit as part of the program on the Techstars-sponsored Startup Stage in the Eureka Park startup section of the annual technology show.

      "content": "(BigStock Photo).\n (Updated Jan. 18 to reflect the correct date the rule takes effect). The Department of Homeland Security has officially published a provision to make it easier for immigrant entrepreneurs to build startups in the U.S. The rule, proposed by President Barack Obama last summer, will take effect July 17. The rule was proposed as a workaround for foreign entrepreneurs after Congress failed to pass meaningful immigration reform. There isn't a great avenue for business leaders from other countries to build companies in the U.S. because visas, like the H1B, only apply to skilled employees, not startup founders. GeekWire reported on the so-called \"International Entrepreneur Rule\" when it was first proposed in August, and followed up with reactions from immigrant business leaders and experts on the subject. The initial rule outlined a \"parole\" period that foreign entrepreneurs could apply for, granting two years in the U.S. to grow a startup. To qualify, the founder had to prove that the startup met certain requirements and demonstrated the potential for \"significant public benefit.\" After the initial parole period, the founder could apply to extend his or her stay in the U.S. for an additional three years, if the startup met additional benchmarks. Over the past five months, DHS has been collecting public feedback on the proposal to inform the final rule. That comment period led to a few key changes to the final rule, enacted today. Instead of a two-year period followed by a three-year period, the rule now says entrepreneurs can apply for an initial parole of 2.5 years, followed by an extended period of 2.5 additional years. The proposed rule said startups needed to have investments of at least $345,000 from qualified U.S. investors to apply for parole. DHS has reduced that minimum required investment to $250,000. The official rule also gives entrepreneurs more time to land funding -- 18 months instead of one year. The final rule also reduces the ownership stake the founder needs to have to qualify. Instead of 15 percent, entrepreneurs need to own only 10 percent of the startup to qualify for the initial parole period. To re-apply for an additional 2.5 years, founders just need 5 percent ownership. In the proposed rule, a startup had to generate at least 10 jobs during the initial 2.5-year parole period to qualify for an extension. That number has been reduced to five jobs in the final rule. Generally speaking, the final rule loosens up on a number of benchmarks necessary to qualify for the parole, responding to criticism that the proposed requirements were too restrictive. It allows for startups to use \"alternative criteria\" to demonstrate they'll benefit the U.S. economy. The final rule also has more relaxed requirements for qualified investments, qualified investors and startup entities. Explore the full International Entrepreneur Rule below.

Kitchenbowl, a Seattle-based startup that built a social recipe app to help people make food, has been acquired by ABC Cooking, a Japan-based company that operates cooking schools across Asia. Kitchenbowl co-founder Ryan Waliany told GeekWire that he sent a cold email to ABC Cooking nearly one year ago about a potential licensing partnership to power one of their new cooking school concepts that leverages Kitchenbowl's GIF-recipe format. Waliany, who started Kitchenbowl with his wife Serena Wu, said that his 7-person company ultimately \"could no longer see a clear path to a high-growth technology venture.\" The app had nice year-over-year user growth, but the speed was slower than anticipated. The co-founders felt that an acquisition was the best path forward, despite access to additional capital. \"Our vision was to make cooking easier and more accessible to everyone,\" Waliany said. \"While we were unable to do that as a stand-alone company, I believe Eiko and the ABC Cooking team will be able to carry this forward with a similar mission.\" ABC Cooking will integrate Kitchenbowl's video technology into its cooking studio expereince that combines self-guided instruction with hands-on teaching. \"The acquisition enhances ABC Cooking Studio's unique ability to offer differentiated learning experiences, both in-studio and online,\" Eiko Okamoto, COO of ABC Cooking, said in a statement. \"As we continue to grow our footprint globally, our members are becoming more diverse and web focused. This acquisition will help drive our vision of connecting our global members online and creating a community of home cooks all over the world.\" Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Waliany and two Kitchenbowl engineers are headed to Uber; Wu has joined Instacart. Kitchenbowl, which re-located from San Francisco to Seattle in 2014,  raised a $1.3 million seed round in 2015 from investors like Hand of God Wines founder Jon Staenberg, Beecher's Cheese owner Kurt Dammeier, former AllRecipes CEO Bill Moore, ModPizza CEO Scott Svenson, and others. The company inked partnerships with Seattle-based celebrity chefs like Tom Douglas and Ethan Stowell as contributors to its recipe platform, which differentiated from other recipe apps by concentrating on high-quality photos that show users how to cook a meal from their mobile device, rather than relying on word-heavy blogs. This past May, Kitchenbowl debuted Fork It, an app that encouraged users to cook at home and track their food with simple check-ins. ",

She saw big inefficiencies in the salon industry that she thought the right technology could solve. The idea stayed with her through college and she couldn't shake it in her years working as a developer for Expedia and a program manager at Microsoft. While still at Microsoft, she began working on Tousled, her idea to disrupt the salon industry with on-demand beauty and grooming services. \"I realized that I wouldn't be satisfied until I left Microsoft and pursued it as a full-time endeavor,\" she said. Shortly after leaving Microsoft, Dandawate met Melissa O'Neill Albert, a longtime marketing exec with over 20 years of experience developing brands. The two decided to take the entrepreneurial plunge together. \"With her tremendous skills in marketing, PR, and business strategy, she is such a compliment to my skill set,\" Dandawate said. \"We have grown by leaps and bounds.\" They officially launched Tousled in 2015. Using the service, customers can request haircuts, manicures, massages, and other self-care services on-demand. Tousled suggests a licensed professional from the company's network, who travels to the customer's home, office, or other designated location. Tousled also does monthly pop-ups with companies in the Seattle region, like Microsoft and Facebook. We caught up with Dandawate for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for her answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"Tousled is a marketplace that connects clients with beauty, barbering and wellness professionals for services when and where they want them.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"Working as a software engineer at Microsoft, I kept thinking [about] applying technology to the outdated salon industry, where I spent many hours working while an engineering student. I kept thinking about the efficiencies and delight that technology could bring, especially given changing customer expectations.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Bootstrap, because that is where you need to start, and now getting ready to close our Angel round. If you don't put some skin in the game, we don't think it is fair to ask anyone else to.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"The chemistry of our team and the fact that the foundation of our product is social. Yes, we are a marketplace, but we are also a beauty, grooming and wellness community. Tousled has Instagram and Facebook integration and is rich with shared photos, videos, conversations and content, leading to deep engagement.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Keeping our costs down while we test different strategies and product revs.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"We think of them as 'learning opportunities.' Out of the gate, we assumed every tactic we used to get customers had to be 'scalable,' but it is good to be scrappy when you are starting. You need to figure out your product-market fit so find your customers any way you can.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"We'll take Sheryl Sandberg. If you believe the adage, 'if you want something done, give it to a busy person' then who better than a woman? Sheryl keeps breaking ground with open, honest discussion of challenges women leaders face and responsibilities we juggle, advocating for strong women networks, particularly in tech.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Brainstorming. We love solving problems and, as a startup, we have new challenges every day. How do we automate certain information? What new feature should be built into the product? It is all in a day's work.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Passion and complimentary skill sets. We want people who believe in the vision for what we are building and can add value to our team - while not locking their knees. Flexibility is also key because the business grows in many ways you don't expect.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Roll up your sleeves and don't think you are above doing any part of the business. Melissa and I aren't hair stylists, makeup artists or massage therapists, but, despite our work experience and education, we still sweep up hair, carry massage tables or go door-to-door soliciting customers. You have more respect for each role if you wear those shoes, and it helps you see your business from fresh perspectives.\" ",

      "content": "Electron micrograph of E. coli bacteria. (Public Domain Photo)\n There's a reason bacteria take up almost an entire kingdom in our map of life: they are an endlessly complex and varied group of microorganisms, and that can become a real problem when a patient with a bacterial infection needs care. Today, doctors can make an educated guess to what bacteria the patient's body is battling, but it still takes up to three days to culture the bacteria and know for certain how to treat it. Seattle-based ID Genomics is hoping to change that with two devices that can identify a bacteria's genetic \"fingerprint\" and connect that marker to a database of information -- including the best drugs to treat each bacteria -- in under and hour. Today, the startup announced a consortium of eight hospitals and clinics across the nation that will begin using the tech, contributing to the startup's database. ID Genomics founder Dr. Evgeni Sokurenko says that, with the consortium's help, this system could revolutionize how bacterial infections are treated. Sokurenko, who developed the ID Genomics tech in his lab at the UW, told GeekWire that the current method of diagnosing bacterial infections leaves doctors in the dark. When a doctor suspects a patient has a bacterial infection, he knows almost nothing about the particular bacteria and how to treat it, Sokurenko said. This means that the rate of misdiagnosis can be as high as 35 to 40 percent in some areas, he said. Sokurenko began looking for a better method to diagnose bacterial infections. He began studying bacterial DNA, and found that the DNA is made up of distinct regions that are either present or not present, like a switch being thrown on and off. \"And when you start to analyze the DNA all of these types of regions, you create a long list of binary code for each bacteria. So it creates a binary fingerprint of presence, absence. Zero, one,\" like a unique fingerprint, he said. This fingerprint means each bacteria has a unique code, and ID Genomics uses that code to enter information on the bacteria into their database. \"It's like going to the criminal database, the police database, and pulling out a fingerprint,\" Sokurenko said. That database holds information on how to treat the bacteria, but like a police file it also has a history and known associates of the bacteria. Now, instead of each infection existing in isolation, individual bacteria and bacterial strains can be tracked across space and time. Sokurenko said this provides a completely new insight to how bacteria move, spread, and evolve. For the moment, ID Genomics' CLoNeT, which identifies the bacterial fingerprints, and BactNeT, which connects that ID to the database, are being tested in an observational clinical trial at the Group Health urgent care center in Seattle's Capitol Hill district. It will soon be used in hospitals and clinics taking part in the consortium, including Group Health Cooperative, Seattle Children's Research Institute and Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, as well as medical centers in Los Angeles, New York City, and Minneapolis. ID Genomics spun out of the UW in 2013, and now employs 10 in its Seattle office and its lab in Bellevue, Wash. ",

Madrona also today promoted S. \"Soma\" Somasegar to managing director, one year after he joined the firm as a venture partner following a nearly three-decade career at Microsoft. \"He has added greatly to our existing portfolio companies with his deep, developer-centric understanding of both technological and management experience, and has also become a powerful voice internally and externally on key investment areas including DevOps, machine learning and virtual reality,\" Madrona Managing Director Matt McIlwain wrote in a blog post. Madrona made two other promotions today. Julie Sandler, who joined the firm in 2011 from Amazon and was a presidential leadership scholar last year, was promoted to partner. Sandler, GeekWire's 2014 Geek of the Year, is the first female partner at Madrona. \"She has always been a strong and persistent voice supporting entrepreneurs and the community around us,\" McIlwain wrote. \"She is a steward for our investors and a mentor to a growing number of people in the Seattle region.\" Daniel Li, who joined in August 2015 as an associate, is now a senior associate. \"All of these appointments speak to the growing opportunity that Madrona sees in our region to build lasting and large technology businesses,\" McIlwain wrote. \"We had two successful IPOs last year -- Impinj and Apptio -- both of which are substantial forces not only here in the Seattle area but in the technology industry at large. In addition, the continued industry leadership of companies like Amazon and Microsoft and incredible talent in our region highlight the huge potential of our innovation ecosystem to create more great companies and products.\" Madrona marked its 20th anniversary last year. Its investments have had an outsized impact on the Seattle startup market, starting with co-founder Tom Alberg's early investment in Amazon.com, and extending to companies such as Redfin, Apptio, Pro.com, Peach, Smartsheet and many others. Elise Hebb, who spent nearly a decade at Madrona as director of investor relations and business development, recently left to fellow Seattle-based VC firm Maveron. Seattle tech vet and talent expert Kerry Van Voris left her position as Madrona's director of talent in November. ",

      "content": "(Photo via Shutterstock).\n Two years ago, in my article titled, \"What President Obama's immigration announcement means for tech companies and entrepreneurs,\" I discussed the president's executive actions on immigration that he'd just announced at the time. The final piece of those executive actions has lead to an exciting new development that a new administration won't be able to dismantle -- at least not so easily. On Dec. 27, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created a new set of standards for the little-used program known as the National Interest Waiver (NIW), a green card option for exceptional foreign immigrants whose work is considered of national interest. And the revamped NIW has opened up a whole new avenue for some foreign entrepreneurs to also gain legal permanent status. The USCIS' Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) issued a precedent decision in a case known as Matter of Dhansar. The decision is the logical next step to the Obama Administration's new Entrepreneurial Parole program that will soon begin admitting foreign inventors and founders of startup companies into the U.S. on a temporary, case-by-case basis. Taken together, these policy changes are a huge development for foreign entrepreneurs who currently have few options to either enter the U.S. to tend to their companies or remain permanently to watch those companies grow. While other countries, including neighboring Canada, have been moving frantically to welcome immigrants and their business-generating ideas, efforts by Congress to create a startup visa, over the last seven years, have all failed. Entrepreneurial Parole and a revamped NIW, that seeks to meet the contemporary needs of business startup and development, are currently immigrant entrepreneurs' best hope. Any immigration attorney who has worked to obtain NIW on a client's behalf knows how difficult a standard it is to meet; for entrepreneurs, it's almost impossible. There's no statutory definition of \"national interest\" and USCIS has relied on an AAO decision, from the 1998 Matter of New York State Department of Transportation case, for guidance in deciding such cases. The New York case sets forth a three-prong test, requiring that the area of employment be of \"substantial intrinsic merit;\" proposed benefit from the person's work be national in scope and that applicants demonstrate that the national interest would be harmed if the position had to open for recruitment. Under the new Dhansar standards, the overall focus shifts to the talent and value the foreign entrepreneur brings to the table, taking into account the person's skills, experience and record of past success and future potential. There's recognition of the kind of impact these inventors can have on the economy and clarifies that the \"national in scope\" test can allow for economic development in depressed areas of local communities. Additionally, unlike the previous law, in which we had to show that losing the applicant would harm the U.S., we can now show that that person will be beneficial to the U.S. USCIS will evaluate each applicant's background and work impact to see if it will be \"impractical\" to get a job offer and whether it is \"sufficiently urgent\" to waive evidence of recruitment efforts to fill the position. The new decision is much clearer and provides concrete examples of how the standards can be applied in individual cases. It is especially beneficial to startup founders and entrepreneurs, particularly those who will enter the U.S. in coming months under the new Entrepreneurial Parole. The decision will also help those who fall short of satisfying the criteria for an EB1 visa, which is available to outstanding researchers or professors as well as E2 investor visa holders who have long been hoping for a green-card option. Still, it is important to remember that immigration cases are never easy and we will continue to have to meet the high standards of NIW cases. But at a time when looming immigration news doesn't fill us with much hope, this change is a major boost. And the winners here aren't just the entrepreneur, but the economy and those Americans who will benefit from the jobs this will generate. ",

      "content": "Envelop founder and CEO Bob Berry. (GeekWire Photo)\n Envelop VR, a virtual reality startup out of Bellevue, Wash., has ceased operations, according to the company's website. The startup, which specialized in VR apps for businesses, was backed by Madrona Venture Group, Alphabet's venture capital arm GV, and several high-profile angel investors.  It's been a bumpy road for Envelop for the past year as the company navigated the nascent VR market with fierce competition in the space. The news of Envelop shutting down, first reported by the Puget Sound Business Journal, comes just four months after the company cut its staff down to about 20. \"We did let go of a few folks mostly around sales and marketing as an adjustment to market conditions,\" Envelop founder and CEO Bob Berry told GeekWire at the time. Envelop launched in 2014 with a unique product that allowed employees to work in a virtual environment. Using the technology, an employee, wearing a VR headset, could interact with a virtual Windows desktop and access infinite monitors in a 3D space. At the time of the layoffs, Berry told GeekWire that Envelop was still trying to figure out the best use cases for what he called \"immersive computing.\" He said selling the product to enterprise customers was a challenge in and of itself. \"Enterprise sales cycles are long, but when you add this new technology on top that you can't understand until you experience it, it makes everything longer,\" he said. Berry is also the CEO of Bellevue-based video game studio Uber Entertainment. Envelop, which has raised $7.5 million to date, launched its Windows public beta this past August. Its competitors  include Virtual Desktop for Rift and Vive, Valve's Steam Desktop Theater, and the virtual desktop mode in Microsoft's own HoloLens, which is a Windows 10 device in the form of an augmented reality headset. Virtual reality could become a $150 billion market by 2022, according to some analysts. During the first half of 2016, $1.3 billion had been invested in 76 deals for VR-related companies, a growth rate of 85 percent over last year's total. But some investors are wary. \"There are no VC opportunities in AR/VR in the near term,\" Voyager Capital's Erik Benson said last month, adding that he sees limited promise in virtual reality. Benson also said that most of the money flowing in VR today is coming from venture capitalists, not paying customers. \"Today, I see no billion-dollar companies in VR,\" said Benson, adding that there is basically no consumer market for people buying VR products outside of gaming. He said it will be at least 10 years for that to change. Envelop, which helped host the IMMERSE technology event in October, is one of several virtual reality/augmented reality startups in Seattle. Others include Pluto VR, Pixvana, VRStudios, VREAL, AxonVR, Endeavor One, Nullspace VR, and several others. Those are in addition to larger companies like Microsoft, Valve, HTC, and Oculus that also are developing virtual and augmented reality technologies in the region. GeekWire has reached out to Envelop and will update this story with more details when we hear back. Update: Here's a statement from Madrona Managing Director Matt McIlwain: \"We continue to believe in the future of VR and AR -- for consumer experiences, entertainment and enterprise innovation. We have a strong portfolio of AR/VR related investments and are committed to the category for the long term.\" Editor's Note: GeekWire reporter Taylor Soper contributed to this story. ",

      "content": "The F Bomb Breakfast Club's first meeting, in the Level Office coworking space. (GeekWire Photo / Clare McGrane)\n It's before dawn on the first Friday of January. A steady trickle of women climb the stairs to a coworking space in Pioneer Square. In the window next to the door, a small sign reads, \"F BOMB HERE.\" Inside, the women take off their bulky winter jackets and sit in a wide circle of chairs and sofas, chatting over coffee and snacks. The swearing doesn't begin until the group's founder, Megan McNally, starts things off with an emphatic: \"I just want to say, f-k yes!\" This is the first meeting of the F Bomb Breakfast Club, but the women here are as comfortable as old friends. They manage teams of scientific researchers; they are PR agents for tech firms; they own event planning businesses; they consult for nonprofits. But above all, they are founders or aspiring entrepreneurs in a field dominated by men. The Club was dreamed up by McNally during Seattle Startup Week when she was looking to connect with other female founders and entrepreneurs. \"There's plenty of happy hours and awkward networking events already on the landscape,\" McNally said. She wanted to create a different kind of event, with an environment that encourages genuine conversation, community and, yes, even dropping an f-bomb when necessary.  \"I literally just want to create space for badass women to come together, be able to cuss and cavort and support each other. I think that peer support piece is absolutely incredible. To hear each others' ideas, to be validated. To have other women in the circle say 'Hey, I faced that same challenge, here's a couple of the ways that I got over it,' \" she said. McNally herself never intended to become an entrepreneur. She earned her law degree a few years ago, taking night classes while continuing her career in nonprofit work. Then she heard an interview with Spanx founder Sarah Blakely, one of the youngest female billionaires in the US, and was appalled to hear about Blakely's struggle getting her ideas patented. In the interview, Blakely recounted that she couldn't find a single female patent attorney in her state, and none of the male attorneys she went to could grasp her idea. McNally was ready to leap into action. \"The idea that there's these amazing ideas out there that are never brought to market, that's what really inspired me. I want to change the game for these women,\" McNally said. She founded her law firm Doyenne Legal last fall and is specializing in business law for startups. As a female entrepreneur and a lawyer who works with female founders, McNally has had a front-row seat to the big and small obstacles that female entrepreneurs face. She recounted instances when judges or other lawyers called her \"honey\" or said she looked \"cute\" in a courtroom, and how many of her male peers hadn't understood why she was upset about comments like these. \"It becomes a barrier, constantly being patronized, minimized, scrutinized, overlooked, underestimated,\" McNally said. Then there are the more tangible obstacles. \"In the US, women-led startups receive about 7% of venture funding,\" McNally said, in line with studies that have shown only a small fraction of VC-backed startups are led by women. \"And there's studies that show us exactly why: most investors are male, and men tend to fund men. Well, those aren't little pebbles, those are pretty huge boulders when you have a business idea that you're trying to bring to scale,\" she said. While those obstacles won't disappear overnight, the F Bomb Breakfast Club is a forum for women to find ways to overcome them, and encourage each other through the challenges of entrepreneurship, McNally said. They meet the first Friday of each month, at 7 a.m., in the Level offices in Pioneer Square. More information available on McNally's blog, The Doyenne Project. ",

      "content": "Arivale's Seattle 10 cocktail napkin. The scientific wellness startup was recognized as part of the Seattle 10 in 2015. (GeekWire Photo)\n The field of scientific wellness may still be young, but Seattle's Arivale -- a startup that takes a data-driven approach to health and wellness -- is chugging right along. The company was founded in 2014 by genetics pioneer Lee Hood and Arivale CEO Clayton Lewis, and has raised substantial funds since then to fuel its scientific wellness program. Now the company has announced a second program, one focused specifically on weight loss. The weight loss program works similarly to Arivale's general wellness program. It is based on a slew of data about the participant: factors like genetics, family history, sleep patterns, stress, and biological markers like hormones are taken into account to develop a unique plan to help each participant to meet their goals. Participants work with a coach to make sure they stay on track with their tightly tailored nutritional and exercise regimens. Each participant also receives a Fitbit device and a connected scale so their coach can continue to collect data on their progress throughout the program. Arivale emphasizes that its new program is different from most weight loss plans because it ditches the one-size-fits-all approach, instead focusing on hard data that provides a unique plan for every participant. \"Research is clear, people who struggle with excess body weight are dealing with a complex scenario of biological, genetic, behavioral and environmental factors,\" Dr. Jennifer Lovejoy, Arivale's chief translational science officer, in a statement. \"And for the first time in my career, a systems approach is available to address the inherent complexity of losing weight and help people optimize their wellness.\" The weight loss program is currently available to residents of Washington, Oregon, and California and is priced at $3,000/year per person, until the end of February. [Editor's Note: GeekWire's chief business officer, Daniel Rossi, is taking part in Arivale's general wellness program to help manage his Type 2 diabetes and related health concerns. GeekWire is paying for the program as part of an independent review of Arivale, and Daniel's experience is being documented in this special series.] ",

After nearly a decade working at Madrona Venture Group, Hebb recently accepted a new position as COO and partner at Maveron. It's a bit unusual -- at least in Seattle's collegial and collaborative venture capital circles -- to see a high-ranking venture capital executive switch teams. But Hebb tells GeekWire that she was ready for a new challenge. \"I loved every day of my nine-and-a-half years with Madrona, but it was time for a bigger role and new challenges,\" said Hebb in an email to GeekWire. In her new role, Hebb will lead finance and operations for Maveron. She will also oversee marketing, investor relations and fundraising. \"Elise's experience and network adds another great player to our already talented team,\" said Maveron co-founder and Managing Partner Dan Levitan in a press release. \"We are constantly focused on raising our game as we partner with America's best brand building entrepreneurs. Elise has that same passion and we can't wait to see what she does in this new, strategic role.\" At Madrona, Hebb served as director of investor relations and business development. Maveron and Madrona are two of Seattle's most prominent and well funded venture capital funds. Founded in 1998 by Levitan and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, Maveron made its mark with an early bet on eBay. Other prominent investments have included Pinkberry, Zulily, Trupanion, General Assembly and Arivale, with Maveron focusing almost exclusively on consumer-oriented companies. \"As soon as I started talking to Maveron it was clear it has a very special soul,\" said Hebb in a release. \"This firm believes that great teams build great brands and Maveron has invested a ton of time in getting its own team right. I am excited to take on this new role for the firm and contribute to helping build a program that consistently funds the iconic brands of tomorrow.\" She added in an email to GeekWire that she'll have a senior role in business decisions, and will support portfolio companies with events and other activities. \"I'm super excited to be able to stay in Seattle and VC,\" she said. Madrona and Maveron have co-invested in startups over the years, backing companies such as Decide.com and, more recently, Booster Fuels. Maveron raised a $140 million venture fund in 2014, and last year SEC filings indicated that it was in the process of raising a sixth fund. ",

      "content": "Sensoria's new smart sock. (Photo via Sensoria)\n LAS VEGAS -- Athletic socks used to be something you'd pick up last minute at the sporting goods store, kind of an afterthought. But that's no longer the case. Now, everything is measured. Today, Sensoria -- a Redmond-based startup that describes itself as a leader in artificial intelligence sportswear -- unveiled what it is dubbing \"Sock 2.0.\" This high-tech sock -- made of antibacterial, anti-blistering and sweat wicking material -- is designed to measure core metrics such as cadence, foot landing and the impact forces exerted by runners. It also tracks how far and fast you've run, pretty cool features for runners. But one thing that might scare off average weekend warriors: The price of $199. The company said the new smart socks feature better textile pressure sensors, which are protected from sweat and water. The socks also connect to the company's iOS app, Sensoria Run 2.0, which provides runners with instructions on how to run farther and faster from the company's artificial intelligence coach, Mara. \"Sensoria Sock 2.0 can also stream data in real-time and store distance running statistics for more than a month, allowing users to exercise without their smartphone,\" Sensoria CEO Davide Vigano tells GeekWire. Even so, $199 is pretty steep for a pair of socks. Vigano said that the socks are designed for professional athletes and serious distance runners who need the additional features. \"We've received great, constructive feedback on our current smart socks and are proud to offer an upgraded version that not only has improved comfort and breathability, but also offers more precise metrics to athletes who want to take their running to the next level,\" said Vigano, a former Microsoft manager who co-founded the company in 2010. What if the socks wear out or get too stinky? Sensoria plans to offer an optional monthly subscription, which includes delivery of two additional pairs of smart socks during the year, access to a new web dashboard and Sensoria Run 2.0 app training plans. Vigano said the subscription pricing has not yet been set. In addition to the new version of the smart socks, Sensoria today announced a partnership to embed its wearable Sensoria Core technology with running shoe company Vivobarefoot. That shoe -- designed to minimize injuries to runners -- will debut at CES. Pricing has not yet been set. \"Through our partnership with Sensoria, we are now able to provide real time transition advice to our customers and the visual proof of the incredible sensory feedback loop between your feet and your brain,\" said Galahad Clark, CEO and founder of Vivobarefoot. \"With the Internet of Me quickly redefining what consumers are looking for in a product, we are extremely proud to provide a system that offers quality biometric data to help researchers, coaches, everyday runners and athletes identify and correct poor habits.\" Sensoria had a huge presence at the Consumer Electronics Show last year, and it appears to be back again in a big way in 2017. The company also makes smart garments for athletes, including running tops and sport bras. It raised $5 million in venture funding in 2014. Here's a look at the new smart shoe concept, which is expected to be released later in 2017.  Sensoria Smart Shoe_FirstLabVideo from Sensoria Inc on Vimeo. \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "(BigStock Image)\n With 2016 now in the rear-view mirror, it's time to take a quick moment to forecast what might be looming on the horizon in the near year. Who better to ask than a group of venture capitalists, the money managers who are paid big bucks to see around corners and determine what technologies will impact our lives going forward. The new year certainly brings a set of challenges and opportunities, and this much is clear: No one really knows what will happen. As venture capitalist Loretta Little says: \"what a year 2017 will be to predict anything!\" Even so, we quizzed five Seattle area venture capitalists to get their take on what they think will transpire in 2017. Optimistic by their nature, all of the venture capitalists believe the Nasdaq will continue to surge, with one predicting a 25 percent uptick. They also see a steady stream of initial public offerings. In terms of hot sectors, they are bullish about cloud computing, artificial intelligence and personalized genomics, while many think the technologies behind autonomous vehicles are a bit overhyped.

I can't formally comment on Redfin's plans as DFJ is an investor but would imagine that Redfin will look closely at its options as the year progresses Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: 8-10 new investments (1-3 of which will be in Seattle) Google's stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $845 Microsoft's stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $88.88 Amazon's stock close on 12/31/17 ($749.87 now): $845 Apple stock close on 12/31/17: ($115.82 now): $88.88 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): 5,924 What will be the hottest technology of 2017: CRISPR, voice everywhere, personalized genomics and every smarter robots. What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Machine learning/machine intelligence - not because its unimportant but because it (has) become basic tablestakes. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: I continue to believe we are very early on in the full transition of the enterprise to the cloud. Also, opportunities related to globalization (next billion coming online and entering the world economy), retraining and re-skilling initiatives aimed at those being displaced by automation, and the impact of renewable energy now being cheaper than fossil fuels. Advice to startups for 2017: We've had a remarkably forgiving five to seven year run where so many ideas seemed to work, at least for a time. The next five years will require more fortitude, a focus on 'hard tech' and solving deeply rooted societal problems. Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: Facebook will find a way to buy, or bury, Snapchat. Microsoft will buy either SAP or Salesforce to consolidate its position in the enterprise. Bezos will purchase Twitter and consolidate it with the Washington Post. This will be an up or out year for VR/AR where it will start to generate a market and live up to early expectations - or not. The Bay Area will see a marked (10%+) decline in startup activity relative to locations like Seattle, Portland, Austin, Boulder and LA due to the cost of real estate and housing - startups and their employees will be priced out of the geography. The NBA will announce a return to Seattle. Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017: 2 Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: 10-14, consistent with our pace of the last several years. We continue to see many compelling opportunities and exciting new Pacific Northwest companies being formed, and so we plan to continue an aggressive investment pace. Google's stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $875 Microsoft's stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $67.50 Amazon's stock close on 12/31/17 ($748.87 now): $914 Apple stock close on 12/31/17: ($115.82 now): $115 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): 5,825 What will be the hottest technology of 2017: AI and machine learning will continue to be the hottest and most important technological wave, infusing most/all sectors of technology, as all applications become \"intelligent applications\" over time. What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Autonomous Cars. I think we are moving down the path towards truly autonomous self-driving cars faster than most anticipated just a few years ago, and we will definitely get there. We will see continued incremental innovation and capabilities demonstrated in 2017. However, we will also see players run into the reality of the many challenges around this technology. I and Madrona are long-term very bullish in this field, but the hype feels like it's at a fever pitch versus what the industry can actually deliver this coming year. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: I am extremely excited about enterprises continued move to cloud native computing, updating their architectures to a combination of cloud, containers and microservices. Within this, I think you will see the popularity of Kubernetes continue to increase (one of our drivers behind investing in Heptio). Advice to startups for 2017: Be scrappy with cash, maniacally focus on your customers and prospects, raise money on reasonable terms when you have the opportunity to do so, be very detail-oriented measuring and understanding your unit economics, and then be aggressive scaling when you see favorable and repeatable unit economics for acquiring and retaining customers. Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: Private company M&A will increase. Mariners will make the World Series. Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017: 2-3? Still probably low because there is a lot of private equity out there for solid companies. Perhaps Redfin and Adaptive Biotechnologies. Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: Our investments are based on a fiscal year (July to June). We have made two new investments since July 2016. I expect, in calendar year 2017, we will make 2-4 more. Google's stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $850 Microsoft's stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $70 Amazon's stock close on 12/31/17 ($749.87 now): $850 Apple stock close on 12/31/17 ($115.82 now): $130 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): Who would have predicted the market increases amid all the uncertainty? Will that change? 5,600. What will be the hottest technology of 2017: Tech: virtual assistants & natural language processing. Biotech: CRISPR/Cas gene editing system What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Tech-autonomous vehicles; Bio - I'm not going to pick a specific technology. What makes me crazy in the life sciences arena is when scientists publish a paper or report data at a conference and it gets hyped by others so members of the general public believe there is an actual product. This leads to unrealistic expectations and sometimes a distrust of science. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: No specific area. I invest in early stage companies, so I am generally an optimist and try to track across the healthcare spectrum. Advice to startups for 2017: Be able to concisely describe your business, your value proposition and your goals. Stay flexible and continually revisit your assumptions. Ask for input from a myriad of sources. You don't need to agree, but you should always be listening. Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: These aren't bold -- I think they are pretty realistic -- more vegetables, more VR, Viaduct vagaries and vocal voters. *Loretta wanted to offer this caveat: \"My focus is on life science/healthcare companies so my predictions on tech companies are based on general observation versus in depth industry knowledge. I noticed you didn't ask about Seattle Genetics, Amgen or Cerner.\" Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017 (candidates): Two: Avalara, Payscale or Offerup Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: 4 Google's stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $825 Microsoft's stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $74 Amazon's stock close on 12/31/17 ($749.87 now): $942 Apple stock close on 12/31/17 ($115.82 now): $126 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): 5,680 What will be the hottest technology of 2017: Smart home applications; Text and chatbots emerge as a new channel for businesses to interact with customers What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Self-driving cars; also VR (virtual reality) as widespread adoption (once again )will be slow. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: Advanced analytics, AI and machine learning applications that optimize business processes and/or customer interactions; Advice to startups for 2017: Go solve real customer problems, not a perceived market opportunity; once you have a customer, make them happy and find ways to offer them more. If you have to raise capital, do it early in 2017 before the cost and availability of capital is more constrained. And don't judge success by how much money you have raised, the most effective form of funding is revenue from satisfied customers and partners. Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: -Venture funding will get tighter and valuations will moderate; several unicorns will have financial issues buy the end of the year -Interest rates will rise by 200 basis points and appreciation in the housing market will slow. -F5 and Twitter get acquired. -Rise of populism continues in Europe, threatening the EU. -Seattle will settle on an arena option for basketball/hockey, with Chris Hansen leading the way to a deal. -Seattle Rep musical,  Come From Away, is a smash hit on Broadway. -Seattle continues to thrive as a major U.S. tech hub Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017: 4 Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: Another record year for Lighter Capital.  We will double our deals again and do 200 in 2017. Google's stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $1,000 Microsoft's stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $95 Amazon's stock close on 12/31/17 ($749.87 now): $1,200 Apple stock close on 12/31/17 ($115.82 now): $100 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): 6,773 What will be the hottest technology of 2017: Techno-clothing like Seattle's own Buki-Brand will become part of day-to-day wear. What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Virtual reality. I think we are going to find out who the winners and losers are in the VR space in 2017, with a lot of VR companies running out of steam/money. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: Continued use of big data to help reduce our cost of capital to our customers Advice to startups for 2017: Have a plan for getting to break even (you don't have to be on it but at least know how you would execute it) Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: Patriots win the Super Bowl (again)!

      "content": "FreeFunder founder John Symonds.\n Crowdfunding is designed to help people who are low on cash bring their ideas to life and finance big ticket items they couldn't otherwise afford. It's a valuable resource for innovators, creatives, and people who find themselves in a bind, but the five to nine percent service fee that most platforms charge can be a tough pill to swallow. That was the experience of John Symonds, a Seattle developer who wanted to get funding for a short film a few years back. \"I wanted to avoid the fees on Kickstarter and GoFundMe, and knew that the success of the campaign was based on my network rather than the platform,\" he said. The experience inspired Symonds to build a site that allowed users to create crowdfunding campaigns without turning over a chunk of the returns. After a couple iterations, FreeFunder was born. The site, which has been live since May, makes money from voluntary donations rather than a percentage of campaigns. When users contribute to a campaign, they're prompted with an option to make a small donation to FreeFunder as well. FreeFunder also donates directly to campaigns when they reach certain sharing milestones on social media. It's a win for FreeFunder, as shares help the site gain exposure and it helps customers reach their fundraising goals. Symonds shared details on FreeFunder for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"FreeFunder is a crowdfunding platform very similar to GoFundMe, except there is no 5 percent platform fee. Instead of charging a fee to the campaign owners (who need the money most) we promote optional donations directly to FreeFunder when a contributor is making their donation to a campaign.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"For the first version, it was when we needed to raise money for a short film. For the new version, inspiration hit when I saw that there were other crowdfunding platforms that had figured out different ways to monetize their fundraisers or encourage donations without needing to charge a fee.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Bootstrap! I began rebuilding FreeFunder on the side while I was still working as the CTO of a Green Building company from Seattle. It took a lot longer to do it that way, but the result was having a site built just the way I wanted it while avoiding the normal startup costs.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Something that makes FreeFunder different than any other crowdfunding platform, and the thing that has helped it grow the most, is that we actually donate to campaigns on our platform when they reach different sharing thresholds. This encourages people who visit the fundraising page to share it with their friends even if they can't contribute themselves. Having that incentive out there has led to some campaigns getting shared much more often than they would have if the incentive wasn't so explicit.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Adding the sharing incentives. When a campaign gets 100 Facebook shares we donate $20, and when it reaches 500 Facebook shares we donate another $50. Most campaign owners will make this really clear to the people they reach out to, which gets the shares going much faster than they otherwise would. The cost, from an exposure standpoint, is minimal. $20 for 100 shares is $0.20 per (organic) share, which is a steal.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Underestimating the willingness of contributors to donate to FreeFunder. Originally, even on the newer version of FreeFunder, there was a 'Premium' version that provided a few extra tools. On the premium version, there was a platform fee of 2.9 percent, and I expected that to be better than the completely optional donation rate on the free version. As it turns out, people willingly donate more than that to FreeFunder on average, so we eliminated the premium version and made all of those features available for free.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"That's a tough one, but I have a sense that Zuckerberg would be more understanding of the scrappy bootstrapping type since he started out with some programming of his own, so I'll go with Zuckerberg.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Well I'm the only employee, but I do consult with several techie friends and have had them do some contract work for me, so I suppose our favorite team-building activity is talking about FreeFunder over drinks.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"FreeFunder has almost doubled in volume each month this year, which is great. Although I haven't hired anyone full-time yet I expect that it'll happen fairly soon. I'll be looking for people who like small startups, wearing multiple hats, and have growth-hacking mindsets.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Just get started. Everything will need to adjust, so don't wait for the most perfect plan. Start working on something and just keep chipping away and making adjustments!\"   ",

      "content": "(Kurt Schlosser / GeekWire)\n \"It's not a real sexy story right now.\" That's how GeekWire co-founder John Cook described the Seattle startup scene during our recent podcast about the past year in technology. There were a number of new Seattle-based startups that sprouted up in 2016, along with several lucrative financing deals like OfferUp's $119 million round and Accolade's $70 million cash infusion. But while Seattle's startup activity still ranks among the world's best and is a key component of the city's broader technology ecosystem, there are a few inhibitors that may be stunting its full potential. Listen to the podcast below, download the MP3 here, and continue reading for more analysis.  While having so many Silicon Valley tech giants open up engineering centers in the Seattle region -- Google, Apple, Facebook, Uber, Salesforce, Oculus, Twitter, Palantir, and many others have large offices here -- is beneficial for the overall tech ecosystem, it also could be keeping would-be entrepreneurs from starting their own ventures. Cook noted that if an engineer is deciding between a $100,000 salary at a new startup, or a $200,000 salary at a company like Facebook, a lot of folks may take the beefier paycheck rather than risk their careers at a startup. \"It's taken a lot of the oxygen out of the room as it relates to the startup community,\" Cook said of the out-of-town companies establishing their offices in Seattle. That's in addition to Microsoft and Amazon, the two tech giants based in the area that remain bedrocks of the tech community. Amazon, which launched two decades after Microsoft and continues to buy more real estate in downtown Seattle, is particularly notable as it relates to employees who have an opportunity to leave and launch their own startup, much like we've seen with former Microsofties. \"I've been amazed that, even as Amazon has grown, it's been able to retain this entrepreneurial culture and energy,\" Cook said. \"If you're at a big company that allows you to do that ... that's hard to compete with. I think a lot of those people are still locked up at Amazon and haven't left.\" I remain bullish about the long-term future of the Seattle startup ecosystem. I believe some folks taking jobs in the Seattle area at companies like Google, Facebook, and others will save enough cash and get the startup itch, either by way of investing in local startups or creating their own companies here. The money will flow back into the ecosystem, ultimately bolstering Seattle startup activity. Cook agreed, but said it will take a \"change of culture and style\" in Seattle, a city where people tend to prefer working for many years at big companies rather than launching a startup. He added that there still doesn't seem to be enough capital in the region available for startups; Seattle has long been critiqued for its general lack of investors, both from the angel side and VC. Numbers from PwC's recent MoneyTree Report show $617 million invested in Washington state companies through the third quarter, which is more than the total invested in 2011. Even so, investment totals are down 42 percent this year compared to last year. The number of venture deals also has fallen, from 65 deals through the end of the third quarter of 2016, compared to 104 deals for the same period last year, according to MoneyTree. Here's a look at the list of the biggest VC deals in the Northwest, according to PitchBook. On the IPO front, there were three Seattle-based companies that went public in 2016: PhaseRx, Impinj, and Apptio. That's up from 2015, when no companies from the Seattle region completed IPOs, but it's still down from prior years. According to CB Insights' fifth annual Tech IPO Pipeline Report, there were only 14 U.S.-based tech companies that went public in 2016, which is down from 28 in 2015 and 62 in 2014. The report also pointed to seven Seattle-area companies that are poised for an IPO next year: Avalara, Rover, PayScale, Redfin, OfferUp, Avvo, and Inrix. ",

      "content": "VIA Health co-founder Noah Perin. (VIA Health Photo)\n As Commercialization Officer for the Seattle global health non-profit PATH, Noah Perin observed a big gap in the worldwide healthcare market. Medical professionals in developing countries didn't have access to innovative products, and innovators were struggling to sell their devices in new markets. He decided to create a solution, a global platform that would function \"like the Amazon of the medical supply world.\" Perin founded VIA Global Health in April 2015 with Brendan Lilly, a business development and technology exec who previously worked on the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations. VIA Global Health connects healthcare equipment suppliers with distributors around the world to make it easier for underserved regions to access the quality products. \"VIA is re-inventing the global healthcare supply chain with our mission to increase awareness and access to health technologies in the developing world,\" said Perin. We caught up with Perin for this installment of Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"Universal access to the health equipment that enables quality care.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"Two flashbulbs popped at different moments that catalyzed the creation of VIA. First, working with brilliant and passionate medical device innovators who were struggling to scale their products and become commercially viable. Healthcare providers loved their products, but not enough knew they existed or knew how to get them. Second, was working with dedicated healthcare providers around the world, and routinely being asked, 'we love the product you're introducing, but could you also help us get X, Y and Z?' Clearly, there was a need at both ends - innovators that want to sell products and healthcare systems that want to buy them. They just needed an efficient platform to facilitate that connection, and hence VIA Global Health was born.\"  VC, Angel, or Bootstrap: \" Bootstrap, Angel, and grants. We're grateful to our friends and family, and the Washington Global Health Alliance that supported us early on to build the VIA distribution platform. We're in the process of closing out our seed round and using that fuel to rev the engine!\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Access to medical equipment is about relationships - with suppliers and buyers. Our team has over two decades of experience in emerging markets, and we leverage that deep understanding to build trust and relationships with partners. VIA is a technology platform designed to scale relationships and facilitate international trade.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Focus, focus, focus. Geographically, feature set, platform. The ocean is just too darn big to boil all at once. But we'll get there.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Ran out of fingers counting ... though even the big mistakes have been little steps forward. We're navigating into the unknown and every move illuminates a little more of the map.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"We're pretty lucky to have Gates and Bezos in our backyard, and VIA has sprouted in the shadows of both. Since VIA sits at the intersection of Global Health and e-commerce, can we get a mind meld of both of them?\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Anything outside. Or involving good food. Or both.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Passion for making a sustainable difference. We're a growth company looking to make our world better. International trade in emerging markets is just too frustrating if you're not being driven by a greater purpose (hence why we're not trying to sell TVs in Namibia).\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"I think there needs to be that niggling little worm in the back of your mind that asks, 'why hasn't anyone done this before?'

      "content": "VC investing in WA state has slowed, meaning fewer dollars for startup companies Photo via Shutterstock\n On the GeekWire podcast this week, I was asked to recap the state of the Seattle startup community in 2016. I paused for a quick second before responding that things are ... plodding along. That's hardly a ringing endorsement, especially at a time when the larger tech economy in the Pacific Northwest -- fueled in part by a booming Amazon, resurgent Microsoft and arrival of dozens of large tech giants -- is firing on all cylinders. I am not saying that startup activity has halted completely here. Numbers from PwC's MoneyTree Report show $617 million invested in Washington state companies through the third quarter, which is more than the total invested in 2011.

The league is hosting 1st and Future, its annual Super Bowl startup competition, next month in Houston on Feb. 4, the day before Super Bowl LI. Accepted companies will be put into three categories -- Communicating with the Athlete, Training the Athlete, and Materials to Protect the Athlete -- and pitch their ideas to a group of judges that includes former NFL players, entrepreneurs, investors, and medical professionals. Winners from each category will receive $50,000, two tickets to the Super Bowl in Houston, and acceptance into TMCx, a startup accelerator housed inside Texas Medical Center, which is co-hosting the competition and will live-stream it here. Interested startups, which must be early-stage and have raised a Series A round or less, can apply at this link; the deadline is Jan. 20. Here are more specific details on the categories: Last year, the NFL, Stanford, and TechCrunch hosted the inaugural 1st and Future event in Silicon Valley. The winning startups were Kenzen; HYP3R; and LiveLike; the categories were \"The Future Stadium\" (improving the fan experience at games), \"Bringing Home The Game\" (improving the at-home viewing experience), and \"Tomorrow's Athlete\" (improving the performance and safety of athletes). Earlier this month, the NFL Players Association, the union for NFL players, launched the OneTeam Collective, a new organization modeled after a business accelerator but with its own spin that brings together the power of the NFL with a first-class list of founding partners that includes Intel, Harvard Innovation Lab, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), LeadDog Marketing Group, Madrona Venture Group and the Sports Innovation Lab.

      "content": "A Kasha customer tests the mobile app. (Kasha Photo)\n In July, Joanna Bichsel left a high-level job at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to move from Seattle to Kigali, Rwanda with her husband and two young children. She was chasing a calling to help women in Africa access critical healthcare products -- a calling shared by Amanda Arch. The two met years ago when they were working for Microsoft. Earlier this year, they reconnected and realized they shared a common goal. Together they launched Kasha. Kasha is an e-commerce startup that sells and delivers women's healthcare products, like contraceptives and tampons. These items are in high-demand, but women in many African countries face barriers and stigmas that prevent them from purchasing what they need. The population of middle-class women in African countries is growing, as is the percentage of people who own cell phones. Bichsel and Arch see this inflection point as the perfect opportunity for Kasha. \"There is a lot of talk about women and how they're catalytic in global development but there are too few solutions really built for women from a woman's perspective to be able to solve some of these challenges, such as social stigma,\" said Bichsel. \"Kasha really came about because the mobile phone is this perfect tool to be able to order confidentially and receive information confidentially and then we can also plug into a lot of these supply chains to get these products to people.\" Customers can access Kasha's products in several ways. They can order them via the smartphone app or website, employees at Kasha's call center can take order's on the phone, or women can place orders using a tool called Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). USSD, also sometimes called shortcodes, allows people to communicate and access dynamic content without a smartphone or Internet connection. All telecom companies offer USSD; it's used for internal, operational purposes in developed countries. But in the developing world, shortcodes are open to the public. If a Kasha customer has a basic cell phone, without Internet, she can call a shortcode and it will access Kasha's menu so she can place an order. Their goal is to make it possible for any woman to purchase products from Kasha. \"Something that's so ingrained in the fabric of our lives in Seattle and San Francisco is when you get your Amazon package on your doorstep, it could be a book or it could be a health-related product,\" said Arch. \"There's anonymity in that people just expect to see these packages. That people are able to get the things they need delivered direct to them, especially in Kigali where we're launching, that's a new concept.\" Bichsel and most of the Kasha team operate out of Rwanda full-time. Arch splits her time between Kasha's headquarters and San Francisco. They chose Rwanda because of the high premium the country places on technology and innovation. \"I was just really impressed with the innovation strategy that they were driving here and I'm really excited to be a part of the ecosystem here in Rwanda,\" said Arch. Confidentiality is crucial to Kasha's approach. In many traditional societies in Africa, social stigma prevents women from accessing the products they need. Girls often stay home from school when they are menstruating and women can be deterred from visiting clinics for contraceptives fearing public derision. Sometimes, even the health workers will send young unmarried women home or call their parents when they ask for contraceptives, according to Bichsel. \"I think every woman in the world can relate to the uncomfort (sic) and embarrassment of getting access to women's health products ... In traditional societies, it's just magnified and there are serious consequences as a result,\" she said. Kasha has eight full-time employees, including the co-founders, and has raised $200,000 from U.S. and Rwanda-based angel investors. The startup's board of advisers includes execs with experience at Amazon, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Microsoft, Yammer, Starbucks, Unilever, and Porch.com. Although Kasha is starting with markets in Africa, Bichsel and Arch have ambitions to build the company out into a global endeavor. Their mission is to democratize access to women's healthcare products. Bichsel is dedicating the project to her daughter, Kasha's namesake. \"Every mother wants her daughter to have access to the things they need to live a healthy life,\" she said. ",

      "content": "Seattle faces a housing affordability crisis as residents debate the best ways to deal with growth. (Harold Hollingsworth Photo via Flickr)\n Seattle is grappling with an unprecedented affordability problem, propelled largely by the tech effect. The industry is booming and hundreds of high-paid workers are migrating to the area, driving up the cost of living and housing. But many members of the tech industry, big and small, recognize their role in the problem and are looking for solutions. Take Consider.it, a new discussion platform that's helping the City of Seattle engage in a more productive conversation around housing affordability. The site allows members of a community to share opinions based on a sliding scale with custom endpoints, like \"agree\" or \"disagree.\" In Seattle, Consider.it is collecting perspectives from residents on Mayor Ed Murray's Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda (HALA). \"With over 8000 opinions shared, we haven't had a single personal attack or comment that warranted removal,\" said Consider.it's Chief Strategy Officer Ethan Schaffer of the Seattle partnership. \"It turns out that civil dialog is a design challenge.\" Consider.it was founded in early 2016 by Michael Toomim and Travis Kriplean, two researchers from the University of Washington with a passion for civic engagement. Kriplean, who serves as CEO, studied online engagement and communication. He observed how difficult it can be to have productive conversations about issues online. Consider.it's goal is to solve that pain point. The City of Seattle is Consider.it's main customer but the startup is planning to expand to other municipalities and beyond the public sector. \"Longer-term, we are working on new version of the software altogether that would make this much more of a robust customer engagement platform as well,\" said Schaffer. \"It'll start getting more into the private sector and business customers to help businesses engage their customers.\" Consider.it is a founder-funded, bootstrapped business. The startup plans to raise its first external round starting in early 2017. Consider.it makes money by charging per opinion shared on the platform, a similar model to cost-per-click advertising. But beyond the financials, Consider.it is a passion project for its four-person team. \"For all of us, we're all civic-minded so helping cities tackle big problems like affordability is really fun and exciting,\" said Schaffer.

      "content": "Jonathan Jackson, founder and CEO of ChoiceMap. (ChoiceMap Photo)\n Jonathan Jackson may not be an expert in treating cancer, but he knows a lot about how people think. In 2011, shortly after completing his master's degree in cognitive science of religion at the Princeton Seminary, Jackson was getting ready to move away from a small New Jersey town to a big city. But he wasn't sure where he wanted to move. So, like any good scientist, he built an algorithm to make the choice easier. Taking into account proximity to hiking locations, family in the area, dating opportunities, and other factors, Jackson's algorithm said Seattle was the best destination for him. Jackson moved to Seattle shortly afterward, and five years later that side project has evolved into ChoiceMap, a decision-making app that helps patients and their physicians decide which treatment option fits best for them. ChoiceMap, which Jackson founded in 2014 and where he now serves as CEO, just raised its first outside funds -- about $100,000 from angel investor Tom Callaghan, who will also serve as an advisor to the startup. Jackson said the funds will fuel the app through growth, as well as supporting clinical trials of the app being conducted at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. ChoiceMap wasn't always focused on medicine. It began as a way to help people make a variety of life decisions, like where to buy a house or what kind of career to pursue, Jackson said. \"While we were working on that, we were approached by physicians at several hospitals, who said, 'hey, this can solve an even more complex known problem in medicine. It's in all the medical literature, it's called shared decision-making,'\" Jackson said. He said some medical decisions are fairly straightforward -- or, in cognitive science parlance, they are not preference-sensitive. Say I break my arm. My doctor, myself, and medical science likely all agree that the best treatment is to set the arm and keep it in a cast until it is healed. Little shared decision-making happens in an instance like this. \"At the other end of the spectrum, there are decisions where the scientific evidence doesn't lead to a clear winner for what is the best course of action, and that is where there are usually significant trade-offs associated with each treatment decision,\" Jackson said. These situations are highly preference-sensitive, and require extensive shared decision making by patients, doctors, and payers. Jackson said these kinds of decisions are common in cancer treatment, joint replacements, and palliative care -- treatment that relieves symptoms for patients with severe diseases.  In these situations, the cost of the treatment, the side effects associated with it, and its effectiveness must all be balanced to help the patient find an ideal outcome. Even if a therapy is cheap and effective, for example, a patient may not want to take it because the side effects are intolerable. \"Because of social dynamics, and financial pressures and regulatory pressures, the decisions that are made don't always reflect the patient's preferences,\" Jackson said. \"So that's a problem we're trying to solve.\" ChoiceMap now employs five people at its headquarters in Seattle's Pioneer Square and draws expertise from a network of official and unofficial advisors in medical communities across the country. \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

The Seattle-based company has reeled in $11.1 million of a larger $12 million round, according to a new SEC filing that posted today. Investors on the filing include previous backers like Michelle Goldberg of Ignition Partners and Pravin Vazirani of Menlo Ventures. Glympse co-founder and CEO Bryan Trussel declined to comment on the specifics of the new round and investors, but did tell GeekWire that \"the funding is a direct result of 2016 showing great success of our location-sharing platform on both the consumer and enterprise side.\" The fresh cash will be used to grow the 35-person team and continue developing the company's technology. \"I might sound overly enthusiastic, but I'm super excited about the last year, and the growth this funding will enable moving forward,\" he said. Founded in 2008 by Trussel and his former Microsoft colleagues Steve Miller and Jeremy Mercer (who left the company in 2011), Glympse offers location-sharing technology to both consumers and partners that range from car-makers like Ford to device manufacturers like Samsung. More recently, Glympse inked deals with Rogers Communications, Comcast and Time Warner Cable for \"tech-tracker\" apps that give customers real-time updates of a technician's location. Glympse has similar businesses in Europe that will utilize its product next year. \"Our foray into enabling businesses to 'Uber-ize' their relationship with customers by sharing real-time location information has been wildly successful,\" Trussel said. The company also continues to sign key partnerships. It recently added IBM Watson as a partner for cognitive AI; it added an Amazon Echo Skill; it's now integrated with Microsoft Dynamics and Cortana. Glympse will announce more partnership-related news at CES next month. \"The demand for our consumer partners to integrate Glympse into their products has been exponential,\" Trussel noted. Glympse last raised funding in 2014, when it brought in a $11 million Series C round that included participation from Verizon Ventures and pushed total funding past $20 million. ",

      "content": " Joe Wallin, a longtime startup attorney in the Seattle region, was recently floated as a potential nominee for the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Angel Capital Association in a letter to President-elect Donald Trump, as reported by The Washington Post. So who is Joe Wallin, and what would be his philosophy on federal securities laws, particularly as they relate to startup investing? We caught up with Wallin this week for this episode of the GeekWire podcast, talking about his moment in the national spotlight, how he views the regulatory climate for startups under the Trump administration, and what he would change in the (admittedly unlikely) event he's tapped for the SEC role. Listen to the podcast below or download the MP3, and continue reading for highlights.  Todd Bishop: What are your qualifications to be the SEC commissioner? Joe Wallin: It's going to be one of those interviews. TB: No, I'm curious. Obviously, they were serious about nominating you. Would you seriously take the nomination if Trump did it? Wallin: For sure, because when you're asked to serve, you're going to do your best to serve if you're capable or desirous or able to do it. Look, I think the SEC is a really interesting creature and there's lots of places in the law and the regulations where its decision impacts, directly, startups in the ecosystem and investors. I think a voice for startups within that organization would be a great thing. Wallin: I haven't seen a slow down in investment transactions. I haven't seen people saying, 'I'm going to wait. I'm going to wait and see.' We did get some. We got the qualified small business stock benefit that became permanent. That's a really positive thing for investors and founders of companies. TB: What is that? Wallin: This was something President Obama touted, I think, in his first State of the Union Address or big economic speech early in his presidency, but the ideas was 'hey, to induce people to invest in early stage ventures, let's give them a tax break such that if they hold the stock in those ventures for five years or more, they can sell those shares of stock and exclude up to $10 million completely, entirely from federal income tax. That became law on a temporary basis, I think, in the very first Obama economic stimulus bill. The bill was passed on September 27th of 2010 I think, and then it expired on December 31st of that year. Then the Congress renewed it for another year. Then we went through a period of one-year renewals, but now it's a permanent tax break. If you invest in an early stage company that qualifies, and this is a company that has less than $50 million in assets before and after the investment. It's not a services business, so it can't be a doctor's office or a lawyer's office. Software businesses are going to qualify. If you make these investments, you hold the stock for more than five years, you can sell stock and up to $10 million of the gain can be completely, entirely free from tax. Big deal.\" Wallin: Hopefully we have positive pro-startup, pro-economic growth immigration reform. It certainly does not make any sense to send people back to their home countries after they come and they pick up their computer science degrees and Master's degree from Stanford. To have those people, instead of taking jobs at startups, they take jobs at bigger institutional companies because they think they have a better chance of getting through the maze of the immigration law. Clearly the immigration law doesn't make sense on a lot of different levels. TB: It doesn't, you're saying. Wallin: If you look at the top 100 most valuable Silicon Valley-based tech companies, more than half or just about half are immigration-founded companies, I think. It's a very big number of these companies, right? TB: Right. Sergey Brin and Larry Page. At least if you look at their heritage. Wallin: Yeah. We were all immigrants at one point in this country. Immigrants come with fire in their belly. We should thank them. We should say thank you. TB: On the SEC, would that be your first step to essentially start getting rid of regulations? Wallin: No, I don't think so. TB: I don't know if you knew this Joe, but it's a job interview. Wallin: No. We need regulation in a lot of different places in our economy, right? We absolutely do. We have to protect the sanctity and the integrity of our financial markets. We absolutely do, but there are places where we need to be a little more intelligent about what we do. Maybe we should just not do anything for a while. Maybe we should repeal some of these laws, repeal some of the regulations, and then just sit and wait for a few years and see how things develop. TB: Yeah. Wallin: Think about it. If companies like Uber complied with the law, we wouldn't have Uber. We wouldn't have Airbnb. We wouldn't have a lot of the super innovative companies, but that doesn't work in every context. In some contexts, there's this flat out criminal prosecution, find yourself in jail somewhere. Not a fun thing to think about. I think it does slow down innovation. TB: There could've been companies that might've been created if not for these onerous regulations that you're going to repeal in your first 100 days as the new SEC member. TB: No. I doubt it. But I do think there are things that can be refined, improved. I don't think it's black and white. TB: If you could change one thing, what would it be? Wallin: It's a good question. Okay. I like the idea of going back to the original purpose of section 201 of the Jobs Act. TB: Okay, and that is? Wallin: Section 201 was going to be one of the more dramatic improvements to the law, and it was going to allow companies to generally solicit over the internet or just generally solicit, advertise that they were selling securities. TB: Looking for investors. Wallin: Sure. TB: On eBay basically.Wallin: Sure. If you're a venture capitalist, you can advertise, \"hey, I've got 10 billion dollars to invest, come see me companies,' but if you're a company looking for money, you generally can't do that and haven't been able to do that since the 30s or something. 201 of the Jobs Act originally said, 'hey, as long as you take money from only accredited investors, we'll allow you to generally solicit.' Then in a hearing, a congressional hearing, one of the members of the committee said, 'hey look, I'm concerned that if we don't have some additional verification requirements on who's accredited, not accredited people might get pulled into these matters and lose their money, and that'd be unfair.' John Cook: Yeah. They worry that it becomes a big Ponzi scheme or a scam. Wallin: Sure. JC: Where did that end up? Wallin: The committee hearing of the Jobs Act at the hearing said, 'we'll throw in a sentence that the SEC will impose reasonable verification requirements to ensure people are accredited.' That's what led to the requirements and these regulations which say, 'if you generally solicit your offering, you got to go and collect your investors' personal tax returns or personal financial statements that actually verify that they're accredited.' TB: That'd screw the whole thing up. Wallin: Yeah, you just basically killed the whole thing. Nobody wants to do that. Let's just say a very, very small fraction of people want to do that. TB: You could ask for money over the internet, but then you'd have to take all these steps to verify. Wallin: Right. You got to go do the verification steps. A lot of the angel groups just simply will not entertain what's called a 506c offering be they don't want to go through the hassle of verification. I think there was probably a more reasonable verification approach that was possible there, but that's not what became the law.   ",

      "content": "(Postmates Photo)\n Yesterday, we reported on Postmates' dispute with Washington's Department of Labor & Industries over an audit that determined the San Francisco based startup that also operates in the Seattle area owed more than two years of workers' compensation payments for more than 3,000 couriers from 2013 to 2015. Postmates did not respond to our requests for comments on the audit, but after the story ran, Rob Rieders, Postmates' general counsel reached out to GeekWire. He reiterated many of the points made in the company's response to the audit and emphasized that L&I's \"assessment is based on an inaccurate review of the facts and a misinterpretation of applicable law.\" The audit began after a couple of couriers were injured on the job and filed workers' comp claims. When looking into those claims, L&I discovered Postmates was not paying workers' comp for its couriers because it viewed them as independent contractors exempt from the program. L&I identified a total of just under $320,000 in audited workers' comp premiums during the audit period from July 2013 to the end of 2015, according to documents obtained by GeekWire through a public records request. It is unclear if that is the exact amount Postmates has to pay because state law restricts L&I from releasing that information. Postmates was also charged a $75,000 fine for insufficient record keeping, or about $25 for each of the 3,011 couriers that worked for the company in Washington state during the audit period. Washington has a multi-part test to figure out if a business is exempt from workers' comp, and the audit determined that Postmates did not fit that criteria. The test looks at whether workers are controlled by a central authority, if the service was outside of the company's normal business scope, and whether the workers kept their own records or registered as independent businesses. L&I concluded that the couriers were working for Postmates, not for themselves. Rieders argued that Postmates \"does not direct or control (couriers') work in any way.\" Postmates considers itself a facilitator or a marketplace that matches customers and couriers. He is confident state law is on his side because couriers provide their own labor supplies -- their cars or bicycles -- and they perform a service on behalf of third-party customers rather than Postmates itself. Postmates has requested L&I reconsider its audit findings in what amounts to an appeal. L&I has a standing goal of resolving these types of disputes in 90 days. If L&I denies the request for reconsideration, Postmates can appeal the decision to the Board of Industrial Insurance, and the next step would be taking the conflict to court. Here is Rieders' full message and argument against L&I's audit findings: The Department's assessment is based on an inaccurate review of the facts and a misinterpretation of applicable law. The Department ignored the legal requirement that couriers who use the Postmates app must be \"working under an independent contract, the essence of which is his or her personal labor\" for Postmates. Washington courts have recognized that this requirement is not satisfied, and therefore workers' compensation taxes are not owed, where an independent contractor must own or supply equipment (such as a vehicle) to perform the contract, or where the independent contractor is providing services to a third party (such as a consumer). Both apply to couriers who use the Postmates app -- they are hired by consumers specifically because they can quickly transport items using their own vehicle, and the services are provided to the consumers (not Postmates). The Department skipped over this requirement, and proceeded to a separate statutory test that only applies to independent contractors who satisfy the requirement of providing personal labor to the alleged \"employer.\" Even if this separate test were the correct standard, Postmates would still not owe workers' compensation taxes for the couriers because, among other things, Postmates does not direct or control their work in any way. As a result, as your article points out, Postmates has formally requested that the Department reconsider its position. ",

      "content": "Jay Bartot. Photo via Madrona Labs.\n Madrona Labs, the \"startup studio\" housed inside of Madrona Venture Group, wants to focus on deeper, more technical startups -- and now it's getting some help from Jay Bartot to do so. The veteran entrepreneur, who co-founded four startups over the past two decades, has joined Madrona Labs as its first CTO. Bartot was most recently vice president of data and analytics at Hulu, where he arrived last year after the video streaming service acquired his photo-scanning app Vhoto. Before that, he was the senior vice president of technology for Alliance Health Networks, where he landed after the company acquired his startup Medify. Bartot also helped co-found Farecast, the airfare price predictor startup that was incubated inside of Madrona and was eventually acquired by Microsoft in 2008. It was at Farecast where Bartot originally met Mike Fridgen, who is now CEO of Madrona Labs. The two kept in touch, and now are reuniting after nearly a decade. \"What's compelling to me about Labs is that it systematizes the whole startup ecosystem, from ideation to idea vetting to validation to ultimately building prototypes, getting funding, and spinning companies out,\" Bartot told GeekWire. \"I've done it enough times over my career and learned tons of lessons about how to do things and how to not do things, so I'm very compelled at this stage in my career to be in an environment where I can spawn multiple ideas at once.\" Madrona Labs launched in December 2014 as an incubator of sorts that helps spin out new startup ideas quickly, taking ideas from \"napkin to traction\" by way of recruiting, product development, financial investment, and more. The group has spun out three companies since then. They include Essential, an intelligent messaging startup; ReplyYes, a chat commerce platform; and Spare5, which pays people to spend their spare time performing short tasks on a smartphone. Those startups all share a common theme: they utilize lightweight applications that were validated quickly for product market fit and consumer interest. That follows part of Labs' original philosophy, which was to rapidly test new ideas, a small fraction of which would eventually turn into companies. But now the 7-person studio is broadening its focus to deeper, more technical ideas for companies that can have a larger impact. The pivot was inspired in part by what happened to Spare5. The startup launched as a platform for people to perform small tasks that help businesses tag photos, update metadata for online merchants, and more. Now, though, Spare5 has evolved into somewhat of an AI company, with customers using its technology to generate datasets that help train and test machine learning models. \"We want to be able to advance these ideas here at Labs while they are being built,\" Fridgen explained. \"Our thinking is maturing around some of the bigger opportunities.\" Fridgen said that the hiring of Bartot, who is also a veteran engineer of companies like Netbot, Sightward, and AdRelevance, is perfect timing. He called Bartot the \"most innovative and creative engineering partner I've worked with.\" \"We see all kinds of opportunities to go deeper with some of our technology projects,\" Fridgen said. \"A lot of the technology that Jay has experience with -- whether it's machine learning, computer vision, and more -- are the areas where we want to be making longer-term investments and spin up companies where appropriate.\" Fridgen also said he's excited about Bartot's experience transitioning between startups and large companies, and hopes that the new CTO can provide valuable insight to entrepreneurs at Labs. Bartot is interested in companies working with machine learning and AI technologies, which he said are \"super hot right now.\"  I'm very bullish about computer vision technology. I hope it's time has come.\"We certainly want to be part of that movement at Labs,\" he noted. Bartot added that he's also been a longtime fan of computer vision technology, even before he helped launch Vhoto. \"I'm very bullish about it,\" he said. \"I hope it's time has come.\" Both Bartot and Fridgen said they are committed to growing this new startup studio model and have it \"flourish in Seattle,\" as Fridgen noted. \"It's a new way for entrepreneurs to get connected and be apart of this tech and startup community,\" Fridgen said. \"We're really inspired by the idea of working with these entrepreneurs to make these companies great.\" Madrona Labs was originally led by Greg Gottesman, the longtime managing director at Madrona who left that role last year to start a similar \"startup studio\" concept in Seattle by the name of Pioneer Square Labs.

      "content": "Pluto VR lets you talk to other people while using virtual reality apps.\n John Vechey greets me at the door of a strikingly spacious one-floor office in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood, just off the water at Salmon Bay. The PopCap Games co-founder, now leading a startup called Pluto VR, immediately takes me into a room and hands me an HTC Vive virtual reality headset. He leaves, and a few minutes later, three human avatars pop up in my view. It's a virtual version of Vechey, co-founder Forest Gibson, and Pluto's \"mad scientist\" Shawn Whiting. For the next 30 minutes, I take part in what is probably the most unusual interview I've ever done -- and one that illustrates the potential for how people will be able to communicate in virtual reality. Pluto VR wants to be the application we use to talk to other people who are also wearing a virtual or augmented reality headset. The 2-year-old Seattle startup is developing something like Skype or Facebook Messenger -- a communication app that can run on its own, or on top of other experiences -- but for virtual reality. \"Our purpose is to help humanity transcend physical location,\" Vechey said. From its own app control panel, Pluto lets you create your own avatar, control the opacity of each person, mute mics or make \"calls\" to other people without needing an avatar, and more. For my demo, each user fired up the Google Earth VR app. As we used the app, our Pluto avatars appeared on top of whatever we were seeing in Google Earth. The vision is to ultimately allow other VR apps to easily recognize and integrate Pluto's software. For now, Pluto only uses avatars that show faces and hand movements -- which are trackable with headsets and accompanying controllers -- but that was certainly enough to make the experience feel quite real. It definitely took a few minutes to get comfortable talking with other people in VR, but after a while, I felt like we were standing together in a circle and just talking, even though each of us were alone in different rooms. It was cool to talk about what we were seeing in our own Google Earth app. As a sports fan, this immediately made me think about watching a game in virtual reality and having avatars appear in a virtual living room so we can watch the game \"together.\" This becomes even more exciting when you think about augmented reality, and having lifesize \"avatars\" that look almost like actual people.  Pluto's goal is to create a feeling of \"shared presence\" -- the feeling that \"comes from all of our senses and social cues that exist when we are in person together,\" Gibson explained. It's something that hasn't been possible with existing communication technologies like phone calls, text messages, and even video chat. \"Eye contact, body language, facial expressions, and physical proximity are just a few pieces that make up shared presence,\" Gibson noted. \"Thanks to the advances in AR and VR technology, we are able to feel a sense of shared presence with other people even if they are across the world.\" After my demo, Vechey, Gibson and Whiting greeted me in the room -- this time in reality. It was fascinating to go from having that \"shared presence\" in virtual reality, to having it in person. \"Virtually in person\" is one of the company's taglines. Vechey, who co-founded PopCap Games and sold the company to Electronic Arts for more than $750 million in 2011, explained that social interactions in virtual and augmented reality will be quite different than what we've seen with existing desktop and mobile applications. It will be closer to what we experience in real life, he said. \"We believe that the whole VR and AR ecosystem needs to become socially aware and that applications can assume and depend on the fact that customers can and will be connected with each other, using a multitude of communication services,\" Vechey said. Pluto aims to be one of those communication services -- not just a standalone app for social interactions, but something much more far-reaching and widely-used on a variety of software and hardware platforms. There are existing companies like AltspaceVR that let VR users interact and be together virtually, but Vechey said no one is focusing on \"shared presence\" for a multi-app VR world. It's clear that the startup is thinking big. \"We're not big fans of the 'this for that,'\" Vechey said when asked if Pluto is the 'Skype for VR.' \"How do you make a simple comparison of a brand new form of communication? What was the this for that of the telegram?\" When Pluto first got going in 2015 -- Vechey co-founded the company with Gibson, Jared Cheshier, and Jonathan Geibel -- it tossed around different ideas that had a communication element, like a VR whiteboard application or a \"couch app\" for gaming. But ultimately the startup kept going back to its original goal of transcending physical location and realized that the VR world would eventually need communication services that could connect beyond just one application. It's still early days for both Pluto and the VR industry in general. When tracking technologies improve, Pluto will be able to show more than just hands and a face -- think about your avatar actually mimicking eyebrow and eyeball movement, for example. There are also limitations with both current hardware and software that is available. Vechey said that \"we are running a marathon.\" \"It's scary,\" the CEO admitted. \"But we fundamentally believe that this type of communication and VR apps being more socially aware is going to be the future.\" For now, Pluto's product is in \"alpha\" and will roll out as a preview to a limited group of customers before a potential public launch later next year. As far as a potential business model, Vechey said he's not spending too much time thinking about monetization yet. \"That's partly because creating a brand new way of communication on brand new technology platforms is difficult enough,\" he said. \"We feel that if we can be successful at connecting people to each other, we won't lack from business models.\" Pluto, a Seattle 10 company last year, employs 14 people at its Ballard office, which was previously occupied by pet insurance company Trupanion. It's much too large of a building for a typical 14-person startup, but it's perfect for Pluto given the technology it is building. The extra space and individual offices allow the company to better test its software. \"Even though it seems like this is a colossal waste of money, moving here has really enabled us to make a much, much better product,\" Vechey said.    The office also lets Pluto host events for the Seattle startup community, and specifically for folks working with virtual and augmented reality. Pluto, which is bootstrapped, is one of many new up-and-coming virtual reality startups in the Seattle area. Others include Envelop VR, Pixvana, AxonVR, VRStudios, VREAL, Endeavor One, Nullspace VR, and many more. That's in addition to larger companies like Microsoft, Valve, HTC, and Oculus that are developing virtual and augmented reality technologies in the region. \"Seattle is a super awesome place for VR and AR startups,\" Vechey said. Going from casual games with PopCap to VR communication with Pluto is quite the change, but Vechey sees similarities. \"When we started PopCap, it was fearless stupidity,\" he said. \"We wanted to make games for everybody on the planet. We sounded crazy because only 15 percent of people played games, but we really thought everyone wanted to play games. It sort of takes an irrational belief in some core principles to do something like that. Pluto is not unsimilar.\" ",

      "content": "Photo via Play Impossible.\n Can a high-tech, sensor-infused ball help a generation of device-addicted kids be more active? One startup is about to find out. Seattle-based Play Impossible is coming out of stealth mode and just announced a $1 million investment round that included participation from Two Sigma Ventures, Ben Franklin Technology Partners, and WestRiver Group, the firm led by TopGolf Entertainment Group Co-Chairman Erik Anderson. The company has developed a smart, connected inflatable ball that looks completely normal from the outside but has a bevy of electronics inside -- accelerator, barometer, microcontroller, ultracapacitor, etc. -- and sends real-time data via Bluetooth to an accompanying iOS or Android smartphone app, which lets people play different games and record highlight videos. A charging stick gives the ball two hours of play in just 20 seconds.  Here's a quick video that shows some of the games you can play with the connected ball:  Play Impossible CEO and co-founder Brian Monnin told GeekWire that the ball is meant for anyone who enjoys ball sports and video games, in particular kids aged 10-to-15. There are other companies like Adidas, Spaulding, and Wilson that are creating their own connected balls. But Monnin said Play Impossible is different. \"We're unique because we've re-designed the ball for the future of recreational and active play with no preconception of how the game ought to be augmented,\" he said. \"Our emphasis on fun, physical and challenging games with the built-in ability to video record and share mobile moments is tailor made for the Pokemon Go generation of mobile kids.\" The ball, manufactured in partnership with Seattle-area company Baden Sports, will be sold commercially next year and will cost around $99, said Monnin, a veteran entrepreneur who previously worked at Intel and Microsoft. \"We also plan on making our proprietary physics engine and game API's available to 3rd party developers to ensure a steady flow of new physical-digital games for consumers,\" he added. Monnin founded the company with Chief Product Designer Gadi Amit, who leads NewDealDesign, a firm that helped design products for FitBit and Google; and CTO Kevin Langdon, a long-time engineer who was previously CTO of AirCare Labs. Here's a tidbit from Monnin's recent blog post: \"It's not our normal state to sit still. Active play, anything that gets you huffing and puffing, leads to independence, creativity, cooperation, concentration and fitness. Watch kids at a neighborhood park or an open gym pick-up game and it's obvious of all that is good is in physical play. It leads us to be happier and healthier. So how do we bridge all this goodness of digital media with the greatness of physical play? The kid in me received that call to get moving and I'm launching a new gaming company with two amazing co-founders dedicated to bringing together the digital and physical to create a new type of interactive play.\" Play Impossible has raised nearly $77,000 as part of Indiegogo's new equity crowdfunding program. The company plans to raise an additional capital, up to $400,000, in the coming months. \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Pixvana, based in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood, is developing an editing and publishing platform for VR storytellers. (Photos by GeekWire/Taylor Soper)\n From the moment you walk into Pixvana's office, it's hard to miss the images of King Kong. The film and its cultural significance have become a symbol for the Seattle startup in a unique way -- it's a reminder of the company's mission to help filmmakers make epic stories using the nascent technology of virtual reality. After raising a $6.1 million seed round led by Madrona Venture Group one year ago, Pixvana today unveiled more details about its technology, which helps power a cloud-based end-to-end platform for editing, processing, and delivering VR video that Pixvana CEO Forest Key said will help VR filmmakers and producers do better work. \"We want to build a platform so that filmmakers can go out and tell stories like King Kong,\" Key told GeekWire last week at his office in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. \"Our team mission is to figure out how to enable VR storytelling.\" Pixvana on Monday announced SPIN Studio, an all-in-one cloud-based software product that helps users edit, finish, publish, and playback video files for virtual reality content. Key, who sold hotel marketing startup Buuteeq to Priceline in 2014, explained that it's not easy to create virtual reality content using film editing and production software built for traditional video. Today, storytellers are forced to use desktop tools that weren't built with VR in mind, and that creates problems like extremely long rendering times and limited editing capabilities. SPIN Studio, meanwhile, utilizes cloud infrastructure and VR-centric editing software designed from the ground up. The product consists of SPIN Publisher, SPIN Player -- both which soft-launched in September -- along with SPIN Stitch, SPIN Story, and SPIN Finish, which debuted today. \"It's a cloud-first, cloud-only VR native solution as opposed to desktop software built for video 20 years ago being retrofitted,\" Key explained.  SPIN Studio has unique features like SPIN Publisher, which uses field-of-view adaptive streaming technology that helps provide end users with a crisper 50-megapixel video resolution by breaking up video into a series of \"viewports.\" Pixvana is partnering with Bellevue-based gaming giant Valve for that feature. There's also SPIN Stitch, which syncs and stitches clips from a variety of camera rigs, and SPIN Player, which delivers VR video to various headsets with low latency. With a combination of advanced VR production and delivery tools, Key said there's nothing really like SPIN Studio on the market today. It will become available in public beta early next year; pricing has yet to be announced. \"Our mission is to realize the potential of this new medium,\" Key noted. Pixvana is working with beta clients like Tippett Studio and the Seattle Sounders. Key said the target market is wide-ranging but with a focus on businesses that can use Pixvana to create VR videos for everything from entertainment to marketing to data visualization. Here are a few examples of videos Pixvana has created using its platform:   As far as potential business models, Key said clients could pay on a \"metered bill\" system that charges based on usage of Pixvana's cloud infrastructure. The software will be built not only for companies working with virtual reality but also augmented and mixed reality film, Key added. Key also said that Pixvana, a Seattle 10 company that was honored this month as one of the region's top up-and-coming startups, has \"plenty of cash in the bank\" from its $6.1 million seed round that included participation from Vulcan Capital and angel investors like 'Soma' Somasegar, Mike Galgon, Geoff Entress, Charles Fitzgerald, and John Keister, in addition to Madrona. The startup employs 19 people, up from six at this time last year.  Though Key's last company was involved with online hotel booking, he spent a good chunk of past few decades working in digital media. After studying film history at UCLA, he started his career at Lucasfilm on the visual effects team before moving on to places like Adobe and Microsoft where he helped develop important web-based video technologies like Flash and Silverlight. His co-founders have impressive resumes, too, with expertise in software platforms, visual effects, video production, codecs, and content creation. Chief Technology Officer and Creative Director Scott Squires is a well-known Sci-Tech Academy Award winner known for his visual effects work and also a veteran of Lucasfilm. Chief Product Officer Bill Hensler was previously the senior director of engineering at Apple where he worked on photo apps and imaging technologies, while VP of Product Management Sean Safreed is the co-founder of film and video software startup Red Giant. \"It feels like the thing we were born to do, in some ways,\" Key said of launching Pixvana with his co-founders. Key added that he's still extremely optimistic about the impact of virtual reality technology and said the new medium is \"going to change the world\" -- just not today or tomorrow. For now, it's very much the Wild West, with a ton of potential -- but \"everyone in the VR community has kind of to succeed together\" for that potential to be realized, Key said. Pixvana is in it for the long run. \"Unequivocally, I think this will be a huge thing,\" Key said. \"It's not going to happen in one or two years, though. Maybe five or ten.\" Added Key: \"This is the beginning of what we think will be years of innovation in VR editing tools and VR storytelling.\" Pixvana is one of many new up-and-coming virtual reality startups in the Seattle area. Others include Envelop VR, Pluto VR, AxonVR, VRStudios, VREAL, Endeavor One, Nullspace VR, and several others.

      "content": "Savitha Swaminathan, the founder of Toy-Yo, and her 2-year-old daughter, Indie, playing with some of the company's rentable toys. (Kurt Schlosser Photo / GeekWire)\n Like most things that are well made and won't kill you if you chew on them, quality toys can be expensive. Any parent who has looked longingly in the shop windows of boutique toy stores has surely seen dollar signs blurring the view of intriguing train sets, puzzles and musical instruments. Savitha Swaminathan, a Seattle mom with a background in microbiology and marketing, thinks she's found an answer for parents who want to give their kids the best toys to play with -- without going bankrupt along the way. Swaminathan is the founder of Toy-Yo, a new startup that acts as a toy library and allows members to rent toys for a monthly fee. It's an idea that Swaminathan had been working on for about six months before she soft-launched her site in August. Toy-Yo is now live all over the country and serves all 50 states, thanks to distribution efforts out of Seattle and New Jersey. \"Initially when we launched the intention was to keep it local and kind of test the process on the whole workflow locally and kind of get smart from that, make some tweaks and then go more widespread,\" Swaminathan said. \"But we kind of generated some interest from some parent groups and word kind of spread and we started getting people signing up from other parts of the country and we obviously did not want to say no to anybody.\" Swaminathan's small company includes herself, co-founder Rupa Gurumurthy on the East Coast and two engineers in Seattle. Her husband, Sharath Udupa, is a principal engineering manager at Microsoft and he keeps an eye on what the engineers are up to. The 35-year-old Swaminathan previously worked as a microbiologist. With an MBA from the University of Washington, she decided to move into marketing, working at Seattle-based PATH in the commercialization space of health technologies. After she had her daughter, Indie, two years ago, she went back to PATH for a couple months, but decided her life and focus had changed. With an eye toward trying something \"new and exciting\" -- and with a toy-testing subject now living in her home -- Swaminathan said Toy-Yo fit the bill. \"It was an opportune time to go back and scratch that itch that I've always had,\" Swaminathan said. \"I definitely saw a need for it. My scientific research background sort of guides me when I've searched for toys for my daughter. I'm very particular about the quality of toys: What is the material that is used? What are some of the health hazards of these toxic materials that tend to make their way into children's toys?\" Born out of the personal need of wanting to entertain her daughter, while also keeping her safe, Swaminathan's concept for Toy-Yo is also rooted in trying to curb expenses. \"Trying to keep up and buy these quality, well-made toys that use superior materials and have been well-designed and well-crafted -- they're a bit on the expensive side,\" Swaminathan said. \"I think any product that's made with a conscience is pricey.\" So she finally asked, \"Why can't I rent these toys from a trustworthy place just like I rent books?\" The subscription on Toy-Yo is $19.99 a month, and on average, every toy on the site costs about $30 or more. Users can rent two toys at a time, for a minimum 3-week time period, so at any time they're holding toys valued at about $60 or more. \"There's absolutely no doubt that there is value, and I'm very very particular about this,\" Swaminathan said, stressing that toys of lower retail value are grouped together to guarantee that users are always getting more toy bang for their monthly subscription buck. Toy-Yo is not alone in the toy rental business. Other players include Seattle-based Rent the Toychest and Santa Clara, Calif.-based Pley, which focuses on educational toys for $12.99 per month. Pley's investors include Disney, Floodgate and others, with the company pulling in $6.75 million in 2014. Toy-Yo offerings are geared toward littler kids in the 6-12 months, toddler and preschool range. Swaminathan said that the toys on her site are so well crafted that they're very sturdy. Parents may recognize some of the brands -- Brio, Haba, Janod, Plan Toys and so on. \"The manufacturers themselves pitch them as 'toys that will last a generation,'\" Swaminathan said. \"They're so well made that in four months of operation I have not seen any damage as yet -- and that may change in the future. I'm definitely in the process of learning how many times a toy can remain in circulation. Obviously that will be a very important metric for me.\" A bigger issue, in Swaminathan's mind, is potential loss of toy parts. She spends a great deal of time thinking about the issue and how tracking parts on the user side and the company side relates to the ease of service and the value it provides. \"The more pieces they have they tend to be more interesting because there's a lot more to do, especially for kids who are in the preschool age,\" Swaminathan said. \"It's not just putting a stacking ring together, it's a little bit more complex.\" She said she's the best product tester as the mother of a 2-year-old and she doesn't want there to be any level of stress involved for parents in collecting pieces and returning toys -- \"If you're creating stress in the home then you're losing value.\" So an information sheet that goes out with each toy talks about how the toy is made, where is it made, what materials are used, what the developmental value the toy provides, and finally, a checklist of parts. \"As we grow and as volume grows it's going to be very critical that we streamline this process of accounting for the pieces and saying, 'Yes, this can go back into circulation,'\" Swaminathan said.  Toy-Yo's own little product tester gives this toddler favorite a test. Pound, Tap and make music (and some noise ?) with this Hape classic. A photo posted by Toy-Yo (@toy.yo.toys) on Oct 5, 2016 at 1:50pm PDT  Parents who have trouble prying a favorite toy out of the hands of their tot also have the option of buying it from Toy-Yo. The price is reflected by how long it's been in circulation. As she gets her bootstrapped company up and running, Swaminathan is starting to attract a little bit of attention from niche toy manufacturers and retailers thanks to her social media postings (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). The possibility of partnerships in a supply/business sense could open up down the line. When she first started, Swaminathan had one copy of each toy. But she quickly learned that some toys are very popular and she's adjusted to take on multiple copies of those -- such as the Hape coffee maker and toaster set. Everything seems to come back to her science training, as Swaminathan said she's always watched her daughter play with toys with an eye toward collecting data. \"I completely blame that on my research background,\" she said. \"I don't think I ever look at a product and think, 'Oh, that looks nice.' It's always several levels of more detailed questioning. I don't think that's necessarily changed because of her, per se. I think that's more of a function of my training as a researcher.\" And while she's dealing in playthings now for a living, don't be mistaken. Swaminathan regards her startup as very much a technology company. \"On the front end it's a very sort of 'mom business,'\" Swaminathan said. \"But on the backend it's very technical.\"  A very special Share The Love promo from Toy-Yo!

FlightSpeak wants to take some of the pain out of that experience. Using the Seattle startup's app, Airports by flightSpeak, travelers can get information about estimated wait time, restaurants and shops, ground transportation and more. \"FlightSpeak helps solve the problem of inadequate, inconsistent, and irrelevant information at airports,\" said CEO Leo Osahor. The app has additional features, like wheelchair information and kid and pet-friendly businesses. Travelers can also share photos, tips, and travel stories using the app. FlightSpeak is available in more than 300 airports in 16 countries around the world. \"With over an estimated 8 million travelers worldwide hopping on a plane daily, and knowing that travelers wanted information delivered to them without downloading multiple airport apps, we realized we were onto something,\" Osahor said. We caught up with Osahor for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"flightSpeak helps make airports less stressful by providing helpful airport information through an easy-to-use mobile app.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"We realized travelers and airports had a set of common pain points. We asked ourselves - \"What if we could build a platform where we could help airports deliver valuable information to travelers, and help travelers get the information they needed to save time and actually enjoy themselves at the airport? What a concept!\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Bootstrap and Angel. We bootstrapped until we could prove out our concept, and took the next step to reach the next set of milestones.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Our ability to listen closely to travelers and translate what we hear into features that matter. One of our most loved features - using crowdsourcing and machine learning to estimate wait times at airports, came out of this process.\"  The smartest move we've made so far: \"Investing more time in design reviews and talking to real users. Getting flightSpeak into the hands of business and leisure travelers really helped us learn what mattered in building a 'must have' product.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"We've made many assumptions on what features mattered most to travelers. We lost precious time building features that were nice to have, versus features that travelers couldn't live without.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Rich Barton. Rich knows the travel space intimately, and has a history of building successful consumer brands that win. (Rich - Hi! Would you like to have coffee sometime soon?)\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Doing team-building activities with a global team is hard to do! For now, our retrospectives over Skype video after each release are precious bonding times. They've helped us reflect, laugh, learn, and develop a spirit of teamwork that continues to grow over time.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"A strong alignment with our values as a company. We had several ugly hiring missteps along the way, which forced us to be clear on what we truly valued as a team and company. Developing company values and beliefs take time, but it's well worth the investment.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Listen as closely as you can and get to know your users/customers/stakeholders. Pay close attention to what they disagree with, as well as what they like and dislike. It will pay huge dividends.\" ",

      "content": "Masayoshi Son and Donald Trump. (Wikimedia Photos)\n After Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son's company SoftBank acquired a majority stake in Sprint, he sought to merge the Kansas telecom provider with Bellevue, Wash.-based T-Mobile. U.S. regulators put up a fight and Son publicly aired his frustrations before abandoning the idea. But Son was singing a cheerier tune after a 45-minute meeting with president-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. Could a new president -- and a new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission -- compel Son to once again pursue a Sprint/T-Mobile merger? That's one way to interpret Son's claim, following the meeting, that he would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 new jobs. \n\"We'll invest into the new startup companies in the United States,\" Son said. Trump later took credit for the announcement on Twitter. Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 As WSJ notes, creating 50,000 jobs simply by investing in startups is a tall order. It's led to speculation that Son and Trump's job creation plan may also include a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile. The merger would reduce the nation's top wireless providers from four to three but advocates of the deal say it would help Sprint and T-Mobile better compete with industry leaders AT&T and Verizon. An influx of $50 billion in outside venture funding could have big implications for the country's startup ecosystem as well. Son told The Wall Street Journal the money will come from his company's $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund, which he set up in partnership with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Son has big ambitions for the technology industry. In July, he purchased British chip designer ARM Holdings for $32 billion in cash and he holds a large stake in China's Amazon competitor Alibaba. During SoftBank's last earnings call, Son said he wants to be tech's Warren Buffett. As noted by CNBC, Son was bullish on the U.S. long before his meeting with Trump. Last year SoftBank led a $1 billion investment in online lender SoFi, and in October SoftBank was the primary investor in a $130 million round for Zymergen, which combines biology and automation to solve problems across a variety of industries.

      "content": "AxonVR co-founders Jake Rubin and Bob Crockett.\n A virtual reality startup that is trying to simulate \"lifelike touch\" just raised a $5.8 million seed investment round that includes participation from former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. Seattle-based AxonVR today announced the funding, which was led by China-based NetEase and Dawn Patrol Ventures. In addition to Costolo, who was CEO of Twitter from 2010 to 2015, other investors in the round include The Virtual Reality Company, Keeler Investment Group, Digital Kitchen founder Paul Matthaeus, and Executive Vice President of Walt Disney Imagineering Jon Snoddy. Founded in 2012 by CEO Jake Rubin and Bob Crockett, AxonVR is developing \"HaptX\" technology that allows users to move through virtual environments and feel the size, shape, weight, texture, and temperature of virtual objects. Using \"haptic textile\" with VR hardware, users can experience deeper immersion in virtual environments. \"We envision a world in which virtual experiences are indistinguishable from real life,\" Rubin said in a statement. \"This funding enables us to deliver HaptX technology to our first enterprise partners. It's a big step towards achieving our vision.\" The startup is also developing \"HaptX Skeleton,\" which is a lightweight exoskeleton that applies physical forces to your body.  AxonVR is initially focused on selling its product to customers working in industries like design and manufacturing, training and simulation, and location-based entertainment. The company says it can enable designers to feel 3D models they are creating, or provide a more life-like training process for defense, industrial, and medical workers, for example. Here's how AxonVR describes how its technology can be used in entertainment scenarios: AxonVR will add a new dimension to entertainment experiences at theme parks, arcades, multiplexes, and other location-based entertainment venues. With HaptX, players can jump into their favorite movies or games and join the action. Imagine being able to run, jump, fly, and cartwheel through limitless virtual worlds. Players can reach out and touch their favorite characters, and interact with their favorite fantasy universe with lifelike realism. Full-body, interactive immersion is the future of gaming and entertainment. Here are folks trying out AxonVR's demo:  Earlier this year, AxonVR added two key people to its executive team, bringing on Microsoft veterans Mark Kroese and Joe Michaels. Kroese, a former general manager in the Office and entertainment divisions at Microsoft, is the company's president, while Michaels, formerly MSN senior director of business development, is chief revenue officer at AxonVR. \"Suffice to say, the commercial applications for VR haptics are almost limitless,\" Kroese wrote in a recent blog post. \"Certainly, the consumer applications will be mind blowing. Entertainment as we know it will be catapulted to a whole new level of immersion. But, as the developed world looks to advance their economies through gains in workforce productivity, the first beneficiaries of the Haptics Wave will likely be found in the enterprise.\" AxonVR is headquartered in downtown Seattle with engineering offices in San Luis Obispo, Calif. The company, which employs 30 people and has raised $7 million to date, is one of many new up-and-coming virtual reality startups in the Seattle area. Others include Envelop VR, Pluto VR, Pixvana, VRStudios, VREAL, Endeavor One, Nullspace VR, and several others. Those are in addition to larger companies like Microsoft, Valve, HTC, and Oculus that also are developing virtual and augmented reality technologies in the region.

      "content": "Unearth helps construction teams keep projects on time and under budget. (Unearth Photo)\n Seattle startup Unearth is finishing up its first fundraising round as it continues to build a product that will help construction teams avoid information and communications breakdowns that can cause major projects to go over budget or be delayed. Unearth has raised about $1.3 million out of a $1.5 million seed offering, Brian Saab, CEO and one of Unearth's co-founders, told GeekWire. The company expects to complete the funding round next week. Unearth will use the money to hire more people and develop technology that will use drones, Internet of Things concepts and remote sensors to create a single place where construction workers in the field can communicate with teams in the office and gather accurate information that keeps projects on time and on budget. The product is in the testing phase right now, and Saab expects to release it in the first quarter of next year. Saab is a former Microsoft manager who co-founded Buuteeq, a Seattle startup that powered websites for hotels around the world. Buuteeq was acquired in 2014 by Priceline, and many of its executives then went to work for Priceline's hotel booking site Booking.com. Unearth is the second venture capital-backed startup to emerge out of Buuteeq. The first was Forest Key's Pixvana. Saab said Unearth's goal is similar to Buuteeq's. The hospitality industry was behind the times in terms of technology, and the team wanted to create easy-to-use software that would make things more convenient for the industry and guests. Now it is doing a similar thing for the construction industry. But why construction? It goes back to Saab's upbringing. His family owned a construction company in Texas, and Saab's first job was in construction, so he knows how tough the industry can be. When he became fascinated with the possibility of drones and the information they could capture to simplify industries, the team looked at industries like agriculture, mining, insurance, and others, but they just kept coming back to construction. \"I've always appreciated that construction is this cornerstone of our economy, and when you think about what construction does, we really do build these monuments that stand the test of time, and that's very compelling,\" Saab said. Construction is also an industry that is perceived to have a lot of problems, Saab said, primarily with projects that take too long and end up way over budget. Projects are complicated, unforeseen circumstances pop up, and it can sometimes take awhile to communicate those issues to higher ups. Decisions and changes have to be made. All these things cost time and money. Communication breakdowns are often at the source of these problems. \"We find a lot of (issues) are due to siloed or delayed information, meaning there might be emerging risks or issues that are occurring out on a job site and by the time key decision makers are advised of those situations, a substantial amount of time has passed, and that has direct implications on the schedule,\" Saab said. Saab didn't want to share all the secret sauce behind the product, but he said it will take in both breadth and depth of information. That means capturing the greater context of the entire project and surrounding area, as well as the extremely granular details gathered by experts in the field. Unearth then makes it easier to document and share this information, so everyone knows what's happening. \"What we really aim to do is provide a rich information dashboard coupled with a lot of seamless communication between all the stakeholders -- general contractors, landowners, even subcontractors -- to help eliminate some of these challenges around schedule and budget,\" he said. Right now, the start up has five employees, including the co-founders, and it is looking for a couple more engineers. Much of Unearth's current team worked together with Saab at Buuteeq, including co-founders Amy Hutchins, Nate Miller and Principal Engineer Pat Lasswell. Right now, the company is operating out of an office in the Mariner Square building in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood, across the street from Gas Works Park. Saab notes that it is great spot for he and his fellow co-founders, all licensed commercial drone operators, to fly their rigs. Key, founder of Pixvana, told GeekWire that Saab's creativity and attention to detail will come in handy in the construction industry. He said using drones and IoT concepts will be a big boon to the industry. \"He meticulously met with all kinds of customers, and came to realize that big construction projects would be an ideal market, as bridges, tunnels, freeways etc. -- large complex projects -- would have great benefit from the surveying data.\" ",

All companies need critical documents -- like contracts, statements of work, pitches, and proposals -- at their fingertips. Perhaps they could create a software solution that would generate those documents instantly. That was the inspiration for Qorus, a Bellevue, Wash.-based company that helps businesses create documents quickly and accurately using Microsoft products. Meiring moved Qorus to Bellevue to be closer to the Microsoft ecosystem. \"Over the years we have created and refined solutions that accelerate the process of creating business critical documents like pitches, proposals, and contracts,\" he said. \"Essentially, we make sure that your best content is only a click away.\" We caught up with Meiring for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"We save you time and make you more accurate when creating, locating or collaborating on critical documents like contracts, proposals, and pitches.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"We saw our SharePoint customers spending hours pulling documents together from pieces of content they had written before. It was clear that there was a better way to do this by allowing them to re-use content they had written before. We just needed to give the tools that would make them more productive.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Initially bootstrap and then VC. We bootstrapped until we believed we had product market match, thereafter we used VC funds to scale. In hindsight, this was a good move as it gave us the freedom to do the pivots and iterations that were required to find the market fit.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Our products tightly integrate with Microsoft Office. We have also developed an extensive XML document generation engine and a unique approach to document collaboration.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Identifying the legal industry as a key beachhead and focusing all proactive marketing and sales efforts on this industry until we had a dominant market share. Then move on to the closest related industry and dominated there.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Initially, we under invested in marketing, choking sales efforts and making traction difficult. An increase in marketing spend helped us with building our brand and applying an aggressive approach to inbound marketing strategies.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Bezos. He has an unrivaled eye for identifying new opportunities but he backs that up with a ruthless focus on making it a highly-efficient reality.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"We have done team amazing races twice and each time it has truly bonded the team, helped us to identify unexpected leaders and resourceful players, and been a heck of a fun time.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"In startup mode, we looked for resourceful, gritty people who are prepared to extend themselves beyond their job titles. These people get things done even if it means they need to get scrappy.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Bootstrap your genesis, get to the market as quickly as possible, iterate with your early customers then expand through aggressive marketing and sales techniques. Once you are convinced that you have a valuable product, move forward decisively.\" ",

In a blog post on the acquisition, AngelList said the deal will allow the two companies to become a destination for startups to recruit, raise money and launch products. Though they will combine abilities, Product Hunt will remain an independent company. AngelList said companies of all kinds, from small startups to tech giants like Google, use Product Hunt. Amazon is also a fan of the tech trend-setter, as the online retail giant recently added \"Featured on Product Hunt\" badges to selected products on its Amazon Launchpad startup e-commerce portal as part of a partnership with Product Hunt. The two companies did not disclose financial details of the deal. The two companies go together like peanut butter and jelly, Product Hunt CEO Ryan Hoover wrote in an emoji-laden blog post on Medium. AngelList has helped more than 1,000 companies raise close to $500 million and helped more than 325,000 people find jobs. More than 50,000 startups have launched products on Product Hunt. In his blog post, Hoover detailed how the deal came to be. Six months after Product Hunt launched, Hoover met AngelList CEO Naval Ravikant for the first time. Upon first meeting, there appeared to be some hesitation on both sides, but it turned out they had a lot in common. We took a walk nearby AngelList's old Maiden Lane office in San Francisco. Truthfully, I approached this first meeting with caution, aware that I might be speaking with a future competitor. He was likely doing the same, after all investors were using Product Hunt to source early stage startups. But this isn't what we built it for. Our focus was and still is product discovery, helping makers reach an audience.

(Wrench via YouTube)\n Wrench, the Seattle-based on-site car repair startup, is reporting continued growth after a successful summer launch and is now adding a new maintenance membership program to complement the emergency road service it already provides. With funding from Madrona Venture Group, Wrench has serviced more than 1,500 vehicles and it expanded beyond the Seattle-Tacoma-Everett metro areas into Phoenix this month. With the majority of its service calls still happening in Seattle, Wrench expects to top 2,000 in early December, and there are plans to expand to a third major market in January, the company said. The Wrench membership program is aimed at keeping cars well maintained without requiring users to make a trip to a dealer or franchise oil change provider. Members get two bi-annual full synthetic oil changes, tire rotations, a quarterly on-site diagnostic check-up for such things as tire pressure, fluid top offs and a vacuum and window clean. The program also includes free installation of windshield wipers, bulbs and 10 percent off all other Wrench services. The cost is $14.95 a month for sedans and $19.95 a month for SUVs and trucks. Wrench, which now employs 20 people, aims to provide total piece of mind for car owners, according to co-founder and CEO Ed Petersen.

(Textio Photo)\n When Textio arrived on the scene a couple years ago, it addressed two big pain points for the tech industry. \"How can we recruit the best talent\" and \"how can we create a more diverse workforce?\" The Seattle startup aims to answer those questions using artificial intelligence to determine how the language in job postings will perform with certain demographics. The word \"oversee,\" for example, tends to attract more male applicants while \"collaborate\" is more appealing to women. Formal words like \"the candidate\" instead of \"you\" are a turn-off to both. More than 7,000 companies are using Textio's tools to improve the performance of job listings and attract underrepresented groups. That adds up to a lot of data -- data Textio is now making public. The Textio Index, a database of job listing analysis for nearly 60,000 companies, will be available to the public starting Wednesday. The index combines information provided by Textio customers and data from Textio's analysis of publicly available job listings. Each company is ranked based on its Textio score, a number determined by the performance and gender neutrality of language in job listings. Why is this ranking useful? It helps recruiters get a better sense of where their company stands. \"The most common use case is when a talent manager or hiring manager wants to understand their competitive positioning and overall post performance,\" said CEO Kieran Snyder. \"Now instead of asking us, they can look it up for themselves.\"   The company is also publishing the Textio 50, ranking large companies based on their Textio Score. Companies represented in the Textio 50 have more than 500 public job listings. Three Pacific Northwest companies made the cut -- REI, Weyerhaeuser, and Nike. Of the biggest tech companies in the country, only Google is included. Microsoft is ranked 6,178th in the index and Amazon is 4,394th. \"Lots has been written about large tech companies and their success or failure in moving their diversity numbers,\" said Synder. \"It's of note that among the canonical large tech companies who have made inclusive hiring commitments, only Google is on the list - and if you look up companies like Microsoft and Amazon, you may begin to get a sense of why they're struggling.\" ",

Photo via JetClosing.\n Closing on a new home can be a time-consuming and costly experience. A new startup in Seattle wants to fix this problem and just raised capital from top local investment firms to make it happen. JetClosing today announced a $2.3 million seed round led by Trilogy Equity Partners, with participation from Maveron. The company is a spinout of Seattle-based startup studio Pioneer Square Labs and its co-founders Geoff Entress, Greg Gottesman, and Mike Galgon are also investing in JetClosing. The startup is led by co-founder and CEO Daniel Greenshields, who previously spent nearly 15 years helping run ShareBuilder, a company now owned by Capital One which digitized and sped up the process of buying stocks, bonds, mutual funds, 401(K) plans, and more. Now he's looking to utilize cloud infrastructure and mobile devices to do something similar, but this time with the home closing process. Greenshields told GeekWire that technology tools like Zillow and Realtor.com have greatly improved the way people search and find new homes. \"But once you find a house and go to contract, it goes back almost 50 or 100 years,\" he noted. \"We are building a company to address that.\" JetClosing wants to help buyers, sellers, and realtors ditch paper forms and move the closing process to the cloud. By doing so, the company said it can reduce the amount of closing time, increase transparency, and cut costs by utilizing a more efficient model. JetClosing makes money by charging a fee as part of the transaction when it closes. \"We reduce the man-hours spent re-sending, fixing, re-faxing, correcting, answering questions, or addressing problems that occur because of inaccurate data entry and document preparation,\" the company says on its website. The closing process, which involves banks, title companies, and escrow companies, is highly-regulated and can be tedious to navigate given all the rules. But Greenshields seems confident that his startup has the right solution. He said the current system isn't necessarily broken, but just costly and slow. The CEO likened it to how streaming services like Netflix ultimately put stores like Blockbuster out of business. \"Blockbuster wasn't broken -- you got your DVD or your VHS and it was fine,\" Greenshields said. \"Streaming was just better. We will also do something better, and at a much lower cost.\" Using a mobile-first approach appeals to millennials, he added. \"For the digital natives who are used to using Uber, the current closing experience is pretty frustrating,\" Greenshields said. \"That is a problem. Most aren't buying houses yet, but they will.\" There are competitors trying to do something similar, \"but they just aren't good at developing mobile apps,\" Greenshields said. \"I came from the brokerage space where we built the No. 1 app as ranked by J.D. Power,\" he noted. \"I've done this before in an adjacent complex and regulated space, and am hoping we can do it again.\" Greenshields founded JetClosing with COO Eric Bloomquist, a real estate entrepreneur, and CTO David Wolf, a veteran of Amazon who was most recently CTO at Bellevue-based real estate startup Xome. JetClosing employs nine people. As part of the funding round, Trilogy partner Donald Guthrie -- formerly vice chairman of Western Wireless and VoiceStream Wireless -- will join Greenshields and Entress on the company's board. Guthrie previously worked with Greenshields on ShareBuilder's board. This is the third spinout from Pioneer Square Labs in the past two months. One was LumaTax, a company that aims to automate sales tax reporting for small businesses and in September announced a $2 million financing round. The other is Ad Lightning, which scans digital publishing outlets for disruptive ads that slow down and hurt their sites. It raised a $2 million seed round last month. Pioneer Square Labs uses a unique innovation model to rapidly test and validate new startup ideas before recruiting an executive team to build out an actual spin-off company. It starts with an original idea and spends roughly four months working hard to quickly validate it, using investment it raised from premier investors for financial support. Then it recruits an appropriate executive team to build off the work that's already been done and ultimately spin the new startup out of PSL into its own entity. ",

Total funding to date for Finagraph is now $7.1 million. \"Finagraph has been successful by staying true to our vision of creating really efficient technology that closely aligns to the needs of our customers,\" Finagraph CEO James Walter told GeekWire. \"By doing so, we have been able to truly automate the collection of financial data.\" Finagraph is part of a corporate entity called Booyami that also offers other financial-related products like BBC Easy, which automates the lending process for businesses. Booyami, which employs 18 people, was founded by Walter and Corey Ross in August 2010. Walter spent seven years at Microsoft working on Xbox and Windows 7. Before that, the computer science grad from the University of Alaska ran the engineering and IT groups for the venture-backed startup MidStream Technologies. Ross is a former vice president at Banner Bank and Bank of America. ",

      "content": "A group of students in one of the Microsoft Innovation Centers' pilot workshops work to develop their startup idea. (Microsoft Photo)\n \"Entrepreneurship. What does that mean? And can you teach it?\" asks Darek Mazzone, a creative consultant at Microsoft Innovation Centers. We often see skills like entrepreneurship or creativity as innate, unteachable traits. But there are concrete skills and steps that can help someone start a company, and a new program from the Microsoft Innovation Centers (MIC) hopes to teach those skills to aspiring entrepreneurs across the globe, through the more than 100 existing MIC locations. The program consists of a four-day workshop designed to provide a scaffold for aspiring entrepreneurs to develop an idea, conduct customer research, and leave with a roadmap to turn their idea into a startup. The project is led by Ed Steidl, who joined Microsoft Innovation Centers as global program manager in 2014. For the past year, he has been working with a variety of collaborators to develop a curriculum and teaching tools for the program, and said he anticipates the program will launch early next year. When Steidl first arrived at the MIC, its programs were largely focused on teaching technology skills so that students could get positions in the tech sector. But he quickly realized something was lacking. As he traveled the world, speaking to students in the program, Steidl saw the same pattern reappearing. One instance took place at a conference in Nepal. \"A student came up to me at the end and he said, \"Hey, I don't want to go and get a job, I want to create jobs. Is there anything you can do to help me do that?'\" Steidl said. \"I reflected on that, and a month-and-a-half later I was in China giving a talk to a group of university students, and somebody raised their hand and through the translator he asked, 'Is there anything you can do to help me become like Steve Jobs?'\" Steidl said. He realized the students in the program didn't just want to know how to code. They wanted to know how to use those skills to build companies that addressed local challenges, ones that Western startups would never think to take on. \"We live in this world where I go to an ATM, I have no problem. Stuff is working. The power is on all the time,\" said Darek Mazzone, a creative consultant who has been collaborating with Steidl to build the entrepreneurship program. But in many of the countries where MIC locations operate, like Pakistan, China or Botswana, there are completely unique political and infrastructure challenges that entrepreneurs want to tackle, he said. \"We need solutions that solve for bovine mortality in Botswana, or increasing rice production in Thailand, or teaching people how to code using their phone in Armenia,\" Steidl said, all real examples from the program's pilot workshops. \"Some of the solutions that are coming from this mix are really interesting, and they could scale globally, but they would never come from the West because the West doesn't think like that,\" Mazzone said. The workshops themselves consist of two parts: a one-day Invention Cycle Workshop developed with Stanford professor Tina Seelig, which helps students come up with an idea; then an adaptation of the three-day Lean Startup Workshop that helps them develop the idea into an actionable plan. As part of the Lean Startup Workshop, entrepreneurs must go into their community and talk to real customers, trying to understand what needs they have and how they can best be filled.  Over the three days, the entrepreneurs pivot, Steidl said. Their first idea doesn't often survive, but their interactions with customers help them arrive at an idea that fills a real need. Much of the benefit of the workshop is giving aspiring entrepreneurs a roadmap on how to get started, which Mazzone said can help entrepreneurs overcome cultural forces that may prevent them from attempting to start a company. In some cultures, just being an entrepreneur is a foreign concept, he said. \"With startups you fail, and some cultures have a real hard time with failure,\" he said.   Some of the solutions... would never come from the West because the West doesn't think like that.So far, Steidl and Mazzone have piloted the workshops in 34 countries, and have also held several sessions to train employees at MIC locations to lead the workshops themselves. When the program launches in about two months, Steidl said, these trainers will go on to host workshops in their own communities, and start a groundswell of local entrepreneurship around the world. \"I think people can learn how to do it,\" Steidl said. \"Not everybody's going to do it, and that's OK. But if you can move the needle just a little bit and give people a set of tools and frameworks that they can follow, they have the ability to be more creative and entrepreneurial.\" And, as Mazzone pointed out, strong startup ecosystems won't just help entrepreneurs in rural Botswana or Urban China. When entrepreneurs are able to succeed, they accelerate innovation across the world. \"Anything that helps international cultures evolve is a plus for all of humanity,\" he said. ",

      "content": "The FanWide team. (FanWide Photo)\n Symon Perriman, like many sports fans, lives outside of his favorite teams' hometowns. For nearly a decade, he has been hosting viewing parties at bars around Seattle with other Duke alumni to cheer on his alma matter's sports teams. The experience left something to be desired. \"With no centralized platform to connect supporters with bars, interested fans were often unaware of events featuring their favorite teams, and the bars were often unprepared,\" he said. Perriman and his fellow Blue Devils hooked up with a group of Oregon alumni experiencing the same frustrations. They saw an opportunity and FanWide was born. The service connects fans based on their team and location so they can organize viewing parties at local bars. FanWide's revenue comes from bars eager to bring in business on otherwise slow nights. \"Sports viewing parties are not new, as there are individuals and alumni/fan clubs in single locations doing this manually, where they have to find the local fans, call the bar, check they have the game, ask if they will play it, negotiate deals, then promote the event,\" said Perriman. \"However we are the first company to solve these challenges with technology, providing a fully-automated and highly-scalable platform with tools for both fans and bars.\" Since launching in January, the Seattle startup has grown to 20 employees. FanWide is promoting over 1,000 events a week and has partnered with 710 ESPN Seattle and Anheuser-Busch. According to Perriman, the startup is also in talks with professional athletes to come on as brand ambassadors. FanWide is in the process of raising a $2 million Series A to support expansion across the country. Prior to FanWide, Perriman held tech and leadership roles at 5nine Software, ScorchCenter, and Microsoft. We caught up with him for this installment of Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"FanWide is a social network for sports fans that organizes viewing parties for every team in every city. Our revenue is generated from sports bars that pay us to bring them customers.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"I waited for over an hour to get a beer at a poorly organized sports watching party in Seattle. The bar was completely understaffed and unprepared, despite the fact we were bringing them over 100 Duke alumni to watch the big game on an otherwise quiet and rainy Tuesday in December.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"All of the above. As our revenue is directly related to sports seasons, we have built our business through different investment vehicles. I bootstrapped the company with the first $10,000. Next, I found an Angel to put in $50,000 to scale up our development team. To maintain ongoing operations through launch, our leadership team has funded an additional $40,000 using convertible bonds for equity. Now that we have launched, we are actively speaking to several VCs, trying to raise an additional $1 million to $5 million to grow nationwide.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Our passion for sports. Our entire leadership team are all big sports fans and are working for equity so we can spend our cash on development. A few months ago I quit my full-time job as a technology executive (VP at 5nine Software) to go all-in and run FanWide, and several of my other executives have followed, even though we are pre-revenue and have no income. We believe that we are providing a much-needed service to the tens-of-millions of out-of-market sports fans and travelers nationwide.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Surrounding myself with people that I trust. Several of FanWide's leaders and advisors are close friends who have found their own success in business, finance, law, data analytics, sports management, sales, and marketing. This has allowed us to have an advisory board that has diverse perspectives, yet all have the best interests for our mutual success at heart. Every advisor, employee and even contractor is offered equity in the company, so we are all working towards a common goal.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Thinking we did not need a professional UX designer. Although our engineering team did several design iterations ourselves, we are not specialists in this important role for a consumer app. We waited too long to hire our designer, which slowed down our development and wasted important cycles close to launch.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Since I built my career (along with FanWide's technologies) with Microsoft, I would personally have Mr. Gates in my corner, as I admire and owe him so much. He probably does not remember hosting me for a BBQ at his place when I was an intern at Microsoft over a decade ago, but it made an impression on me. From FanWide's business perspective, Mr. Zuckerberg would enable us to grow faster as a social network and data platform, loosely modeled after Facebook. We look forward to having conversations about collaborating with Facebook in the future.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Our reward is our passion -- sports watching! It's great to bring the 'FanWide Family' to bars for events we are hosting to support our customers, use our product, and help spread the word. No one complains about getting paid to watch their favorite team compete.\"  The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"A person's decision-making process. We are a fast-moving startup designing a new technology, so there is a lot of ambiguity and uncertainty. It is important to understand people's thought processes in how they analyze problems and select resolutions. They need to know how to find data to make educated assumptions, then prioritize the different outcomes against the needs of the business.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"If you want to build and lead the company yourself, be patient and wait until you have the right skill set and supporting team. I came up with the idea for FanWide in 2007, but I was new to the tech industry. Over the last decade, I learned how to build and manage teams in engineering, operations, marketing and sales at tech companies, while launching several small businesses myself. I developed a great network of technology professionals and advisors that believed in my vision and ability to execute. It has only been in the past year that I've had the experience to be able to successfully run a company and direct all four divisions within it. If your experience is only in technology or only one of the other areas, it will be hard to become successful managing teams of people in a different functional role. If you are the 'idea person', it does not entitle you to be the CEO. Step back, and partner with people you trust that have experience in those other areas, and then your company can be successful.\" ",

      "content": "Via Glowforge.\n Glowforge is starting to ship some versions of its 3D laser printer, but it's still unclear if the company will meet its previously-promised delivery date for all customers. The Seattle startup issued a press release Wednesday that noted how it is now shipping \"pre-release\" units. Glowforge CEO Dan Shapiro told GeekWire that these are units ordered \"early during the 30-day crowdfunding campaign, but have some small differences from production units.\" \"We'll exchange these units for production units later,\" he added. The key question for many customers is when the production units will actually arrive at their doorstep. Glowforge set a crowdfunding record last year by raising nearly $28 million from thousands of backers who pre-ordered its innovative 3D laser printer in October 2015. The printer uses a laser to quickly cut and engrave products and lets people use raw materials like leather, paper, plastic, fabric, or cardboard and make items with a push of a button. The company's original plan was to start shipping the \"first units\" in December 2015, two months after the crowdfunding campaign ended. But in February, Glowforge said those shipments were delayed, telling the initial backers who pre-ordered during the 30-day campaign that they'd now receive their printers in June. Then, this past April, Glowforge again delayed shipments due to power supply issues and pushed the delivery date back to December 2016. It said those who ordered after the 30-day crowdfunding campaign would receive their printers in March 2017. It's not clear if all units ordered during the crowdfunding campaign will ship to customers by the end of next month. Shapiro said he'll provide an update on the company's shipping schedule for \"production units\" -- not the \"pre-release units\" -- next week. Most of the early responses to the company's latest update seem positive. In September, Glowforge announced that it reached $45 million in sales. The printer retails at $2,995 for the basic model and runs up to $5,995 for a premium version. Those prices were discounted heavily during the crowdfunding campaign. This past August, Glowforge raised a $22 million funding round from Foundry Group and True Ventures, pushing total funding to $31 million. The 42-person company was founded in 2014 by Shapiro, who created the popular kids board game Robot Turtles -- one of Kickstarter's most successful campaigns ever -- and fellow Seattle area startup veterans Tony Wright and Mark Gosselin. \"He made introductions, and after evaluating many different suppliers around the world, decided that Flex could build the very best product for our customers,\" Shapiro said. Here's an excerpt from a blog post penned by Shapiro in October: I wish everyone had their Glowforge already. We come into our office every day and print with these amazing machines every day, for both work and for play. But we're late in delivering them to you, the people who made it possible. That's not fair. We feel terrible about it. I wish I could give you a shipping date and time to the minute, guaranteed. But the only way I could do that is if I decided we were willing to ignore problems to hit a deadline. Please know that we are doing everything possible to deliver the best product we can, as soon as we can. I regularly sign 5- and 6-digit checks for rush orders that are solely intended to accelerate the delivery of your product. As you know, we decided to pay a premium to assemble your Glowforge unit in an American factory, in no small part to avoid the 30 days of ocean and customs time we would otherwise have before delivering. We're working long, late hours. We're doing everything possible. The only thing we're not doing is compromising on the product. I know you've waited patiently. It's been a year since we first showed Glowforge to the world, and four months since we hoped to have it on your door, every day of which we feel painfully and personally. Should you want to give up, we'll understand completely and, of course, issue a full refund immediately. Should you decide to stick it through with us, though - we can't wait to get you your Glowforge. ",

      "content": "Closer Mobile CEO and Founder Jeff Warren. (Photo via LinkedIn)\n Entrepreneur and former Expedia executive Jeff Warren is embarking on a stealthy new startup project called Closer Mobile, which is said to be operating in the \"on-demand services economy.\" Warren, who previously served as vice president of global product, mobile, destination and customer engagement at Expedia, is not saying much about the new startup. But a recent SEC filing indicated that Closer Mobile raised $325,106, including cash from Bill Gross' tech incubator Idealab. A source with knowledge of Closer Mobile's plans says the company is building what amounts to a \"Kayak for ride-hailing,\" a mobile app designed to peruse and book rides on a variety of transportation services. Warren has strong connections to the Pasadena, Calif.- based incubator Idealab, previously serving as an \"entrepreneur in residence\" at the firm earlier this year. Warren told GeekWire that the company is in stealth mode for the time being, but will be ready to release more details late this year or early next. Warren is a vet of both Motorola, where he spent four years working in strategy and development, and Expedia. He served in various leadership roles during his four-year stint at Expedia, most recently serving as vice president and head of online marketing for Expedia brands Travelocity and Wotif. He left that position a year ago to throw his efforts behind Closer. In 2009, Warren co-founded a startup called Mooi, which was attempting to create an easy way for individuals to share content, news and calendars in a private social network. Idealab Founder and CEO Bill Gross is also listed on the SEC filing as a director. In addition to founding the incubator, Gross is a serial entrepreneur who has been involved in or founded a variety of startups over his career.  Warren's LinkedIn profile indicates that Closer Mobile is actively hiring, including open jobs for a cloud architect and iOS and Android Engineers. ",

      "content": " Two Seattle-based entrepreneurs want to help bridge the gap between startups and investors with a new Shark Tank-like web series. Chaya Jadhav and Sai Talluri are the co-founders of Disruptrs, a new platform that invites entrepreneurs from around the world to pitch their ideas in front of a group of investors and advisors. Nine companies, hailing from Missouri to Miami, traveled to Seattle this past weekend to film the debut episode, which will air online next month. The plan is to move the production around the country for each episode; the next show will be filmed in the Bay Area this February. The format is similar to the popular ABC show Shark Tank. But Disruptrs is focused on bringing together startups and investors from around the world and helping companies that are building not only consumer-level products often seen on Shark Tank, but also other technology-based solutions, too. The idea for Disruptrs came about after Jadhav spent the past several years in London, where she launched a startup that was acquired. She later advised other entrepreneurs, many who had trouble raising an initial investment and getting early customers. When she moved to Seattle eight months ago, Jadhav was constantly asked about the startup ecosystem in London. That's when the lightbulb went off. \"It seemed like no one knew what was happening in other parts of the world, and vice versa,\" she explained. \"We thought it would be great to have a platform that not only showcased innovative companies focused on big problems and solutions, but also to help them get initial seed funding and customers.\" Jadhav met Talluri, a veteran of Microsoft and Amazon, at the Founder Institute office in Seattle. They both know that there are already hundreds of startup pitch events around the world each month. But they think Disruptrs is different. \"There are so many of these events, but they are all done at the local level,\" Jadhav said. \"We want to help surface companies no matter where they are. No one has done this on a large scale or at a global level.\" The plan is to film each show in a different city, with new startups and judges each episode. Here were the participating companies on the first episode, with descriptions from Disruptrs: The judges included Unikrn CEO Rahul Sood; Alliance of Angels Managing Director Yi-Jian Ngo; 9MileLabs co-founder Sandy Sharma; MIT Accelerator CEO Laurie Stach; Amazon Director of Software Development Gopi Prashant; and green investor Allison Sparks. Rebecca Lovell, a deputy director for the City of Seattle's Office of Economic Development, hosted and facilitated the show.  The judges have two choices after watching a pitch and asking questions: in or out. If they're \"in,\" they agree to either invest money or help advise the startup and introduce them to other connections. Last weekend, seven of the nine companies received an \"in\" from at least one of the judges. Sood, who previously created Microsoft Ventures before launching his eSports startup Unikrn, said he was intrigued by the participating startups. \"At the event, I actually found two really great startups that I'll likely help get to the next level,\" he told GeekWire. Jadhav and Talluri are bootstrapping Disruptrs and aren't making revenue at the moment. There are potential ideas to create a Disruptrs fund and invest that money in the companies that make it through the show. The first episode will air online on Dec. 20. \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Vijay Vashee has made a big mark in Seattle tech since immigrating more than four decades ago.\n Vijay Vashee moved from Mumbai to the U.S. to study advanced engineering in 1974. He received degrees from Cornell University and the University of Chicago and, after several years, an ambitious young software company in Redmond, Wash., recruited him. Vashee climbed the ranks and eventually became a general manager at Microsoft. In the four decades since Vashee immigrated to the U.S., he has invested in startups, advised entrepreneurs, founded non-profits, and served on the boards of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Cornell and University of Chicago entrepreneurship councils. He also co-founded the Seattle chapter of The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) non-profit and served as Chairman of Bellevue College and The Foundation for Early Learning. Suffice it to say, Vashee is a fixture in the Seattle-area's tech ecosystem. He believes immigrants flock to the U.S. to start companies because it is an entrepreneurial haven. \"In the U.S., strangers put money behind strangers to build new companies and the U.S. also pursues the best and brightest to make this happen,\" he said. \"Back home, small businesses [are] typically funded by family and friends -- true here also -- but it has been rare for strangers to fund strangers. This, however, has changed and now China, India, Europe are all starting to do that. So the competition is increasing and some of these places have the government backing them, as well.\" But the future of that dynamic has been thrown into question with the election of Donald Trump as the country's next president, following a campaign in which Trump promised a slate of tough immigration policies. For this story, GeekWire spoke with immigrant entrepreneurs and engineers, including many who have made a big impact on Seattle's tech community. Vashee, for one, isn't sure if immigrants in the U.S. will receive the same kind of support from their adopted government, under president-elect Donald Trump and his administration. A wall to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing the U.S.-Mexican border was a cornerstone of Trump's campaign. He took a hardline stance on undocumented workers but flip-flopped during the campaign when asked about skilled, legal immigrants -- the very people that have become the lifeblood for many U.S. tech companies in a competitive market for tech talent. But it seems Trump has made up his mind, if recent appointments are any indication. His proposed attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is a vocal critic of H1-B visas, which allow educated immigrants to work in the U.S. for companies like Microsoft and Google. Trump's newly appointed chief strategist Steve Bannon, of Breitbart News, also has a history of xenophobia that extends beyond undocumented workers to legal immigrants in Silicon Valley. \"When two-thirds or three-quarters of the CEOs in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, I think...\" Bannon said. \"A country is more than an economy. We're a civic society.\" During that conversation, Trump disagreed with Bannon, saying he wanted to keep skilled immigrants in the U.S. At other times, Trump has criticized \"loopholes\" that allow foreign nationals to take tech and IT jobs from Americans. Some entrepreneurs and experts are concerned that a hostile climate toward immigrants could change the entrepreneurial landscape in this country. \"[It] does not help to have Bannon make statements like 'too many Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley,'\" said Vashee. \"America has worked largely on merit and has been built by hungry immigrants, along with hungry U.S.-born folks. The diversity adds to the success.\" Stories like Vashee's make up what the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) calls \"an overwhelming body of evidence [that] the entry of skilled foreign nationals benefits the competitiveness of U.S. companies in global markets, enhances the U.S. economy and complements, rather than harms, U.S. workers.\" According to a study commissioned by the NVCA, immigrants started 33 percent of U.S. venture-backed companies that became publicly traded between 2006 and 2012. Facebook, LinkedIn, Zipcar, and Tesla are among the companies in that group. As of 2013, VC-backed, publicly traded companies that were founded by immigrants had a total market capitalization of $900 billion, according to the study. More than half of the America's \"unicorns,\" a nickname for startups with valuations of $1 billion or more, were founded by immigrants, according to the National Foundation for American Policy. \"The U.S. has a history of empowering small business and entrepreneurs which are not only embedded in its laws and regulations, it's an instrumental part of society,\" said Marcelo Calbucci, a serial entrepreneur and native of Brazil who moved to the U.S. in 1998, during the dot-com boom. \"Even if a country would change all their laws to be exactly like the U.S. or even better for entrepreneurs today, it still would take two or three generations to get to a level of entrepreneurship similar to the U.S.\" That transformation is in the works in many parts of the world, even if it takes several generations to come to fruition. \"The rest of the world is trying very hard to emulate Silicon Valley and more often than not succeeding,\" said Vashee. If U.S. policy is increasingly driven by xenophobia, while other countries become friendlier places for immigrant entrepreneurs, will our country be less competitive? Yes, says Ian Wagreich, a partner at a Chicago law firm focused on business-related immigration. He believes the Trump administration's attitude and policies will deter foreign entrepreneurs from setting up shop in the U.S. He's seen the phenomenon first-hand with his clients. \"In my practice, I had initial discussions with several promising businesses that were looking to set up operations in the U.S. who were waiting for the results of the election, and who have now decided that they do not want to invest in the U.S. because of extreme anti-immigrant sentiment,\" he said. Calbucci, a Seattle startup vet who moved to London this year, believes the entrepreneurial landscape in the U.S. will be resilient to a Trump presidency, barring a recession or other large-scale economic event that would make it harder to access capital. \"However, there will be pockets that might suffer due to more lax or stiff regulation,\" he said. \"Any new trade tax or new trade regulation would negatively affect hardware companies. Data security and privacy startups, on the other hand, might benefit from the public perception of government eavesdropping even more on their digital lives.\" There is at least one immigration policy that could be vulnerable under Trump. In August, President Obama asked The Department of Homeland Security to consider an International Entrepreneur Rule that would grant temporary parole to startup founders from other countries if their companies meet certain benchmarks of success. Because immigration reform failed in Congress, the White House stepped in to exercise its authority with Homeland Security in order to create an option for entrepreneurs. That rule may not be implemented or enforced under Trump. \"The entrepreneurial parole was a proposed regulation issued by the Obama administration, and I think it is extremely unlikely that the proposed rule will be finalized under a Trump administration, given that the transition team has been targeting an extremely large number of regulations and executive actions for elimination,\" said Wagreich. \"That being said, the entrepreneurial parole proposal did have some bipartisan support, so I hope to be surprised.\" Tahmina Watson, a Seattle immigration attorney and author of The Startup Visa: Key to Job Growth and Economic Prosperity in America, hopes Trump will be too distracted to undo Obama's entrepreneur rule. \"The entrepreneur rule was created through regulation, so must be undone with regulation,\" she said. \"My guess is that even if he wants to overturn it, it will not be quick and easy and that he is distracted with his wall. Lastly, any real businessman should see the economic merits of this rule. If he truly cares about the economy, he should leave the rule alone.\" The H-1B visa is another immigration avenue that could be threatened by Trump's administration, particularly if Sessions' attorney general appointment is confirmed. \"Hiring, internationally, a professional on H1 visa is very hard if not impossible already,\" said Sensoria founder Davide Vigano, who immigrated to the U.S. from Italy in 1987. \"For any size company having access to the best-qualified resources is important because it allows the company to compete more effectively and create more jobs. Professional visa policy should be deregulated regardless of the country of origin of the candidate. This is what will make U.S. companies even more competitive and it will act as an incentive to the U.S. education system, as well, to offer and deliver skilled candidates.\" Ostensibly, fostering a more competitive economy and a pool of skilled talent is a priority for Trump. But his comments on H-1Bs, which companies like Microsoft and Facebook use to recruit international talent, are all over the map. He has admitted to using the H-1B to hire foreign workers but said in the same breath, \"We shouldn't have it. Very, very bad for workers.\" On several occasions, Trump has both criticized tech companies for using the H-1B visa to cheat Americans out of jobs and touted the importance of keeping skilled immigrants in the country. For an in-depth look at Trump's ever-changing stance on H-1B visas, see The Washington Post's recap. The future president's flip-flopping stance on H-1B visas is a pretty good synecdoche for his overall immigration policy. Because it seems to ebb and flow based on Trump's mood and the people around him, it's difficult to predict what policies he will actually champion. \"I hope that the new administration doesn't do anything that will impact the entrepreneurial landscape in any way, shape or form,\" said Madrona Venture Group's S. \"Soma\" Somasegar, a former Microsoft exec who immigrated from India in 1987. \"It is really important for the U.S. to continue being a destination choice (including having the right set of checks and balances for H-1B visas) for the best and brightest people from around the world and continue doing the needful to support the innovation ecosystem in the U.S.\" ",

      "content": "Garmentory has raised more cash as the company grows its e-commerce platform for independent fashion boutiques and designers. The 2-year-old Seattle-based startup just landed a $2 million round led by MHS Capital, with participation from previous investors like Founder's Co-op. Total funding to date is $3.6 million. Garmentory, which graduated from Techstars Seattle in 2014, hosts a marketplace that connects more than 350 small brick-and-mortar boutiques and thousands of designers with online customers around the world. On some items, Garmentory allows customers to make an offer to the boutique itself. Garmentory CEO John Scrofano, who previously led wedding planner startup OneWed, told GeekWire that sales have grown by 500 percent year-over-year, which he said is largely \"organic growth with very little paid advertising.\" He said 2016 was a \"really big year for us.\" \"We made the transition from seed stage -- where you spend all your time working on product market fit and testing things -- to building the foundation for growth stage,\" Scrofano said. \"We raised for the reasons that an entrepreneur hopes for: new staff to keep up with the aggressive growth and do more of what's working, and new investment to build the next layer of sophistication and test even bigger ideas.\" Part of Garmentory's secret sauce lies in its ability to bring the experience of discovery, personal service, and community to e-commerce, Scrofano said. \"We focus on emerging and independent designers, thoughtful and beautiful things made in fairly small quantities you can't find unless you go to the really cool boutiques in the best cities in the country,\" he explained. \"We think this is what the majority of shoppers want; it just hasn't been available to them before Garmentory. Department stores used to be a destination, but are starting to lose that war to the boutiques and online alternatives.\" Here's a bit from the company's website: We wanted to build a global platform where fashion's curators and creators could rule online without compromise. That means every purchase you make goes through the designer or boutique directly. Sometimes the packages you get are wrapped and packed by the person who made it. Sometimes they've been packaged by the person who flew to Paris to find it. Scrofano said that Garmentory is \"creating the next generation of retail for the contemporary segment,\" which he describes as apparel that sells in the $75-to-$600 range and can be found at retailers like Nordstrom and Barney's. \"We have a very different view of the future for the contemporary segment than the department stores, though,\" he added. Garmentory isn't the only Seattle e-commerce company using technology to build a new business in the contemporary fashion industry. Tech giant Amazon is also investing in fashion, with a new study projecting Amazon to surpass Macy's as the biggest clothing retailer in the U.S. next year. With Nordstrom also headquartered in Seattle, Scrofano noted that \"Seattle might be center stage for the entire contemporary fashion industry.\" Garmentory, founded by tech industry vet Sunil Gowda and boutique fashion entrepreneur Adele Tetangco, will use the new funding to hire more employees; half of the 11-person team resides in Seattle, while the other half lives in Vancouver B.C. It will also expand to menswear next year. As a result of the investment round, MHS Capital's Vijay Nagappan will join Garmentory's board of directors. \"We invested in Garmentory because we see the opportunity to change the face of retail and this is the company to do it,\" Nagappan said in a statement. \"We love that this platform brings the community of boutiques and designers to the forefront while providing consumers a new and curated shopping experience.\" ",

(Blueprint Registry Photo)\n Blueprint Registry, a Seattle-based startup that aims to simplify the gift registry process, has raised a little more than $1 million in seed funding. These funds are an extension of a round that began before Blueprint Registry was chosen for the first Target + Techstars accelerator program earlier this year. The company has raised a total of approximately $1.5 million in this seed round. Nevin Shetty, Blueprint's CEO, said the company will use the money to hire developers, fill other key positions and amp up its marketing push. Blueprint allows people to create registries and wish lists using shoppable room-by-room blueprints of their homes that others can use to find and buy gifts from participating retailers, like Amazon.com, West Elm and Crate & Barrel. A group can go in on pricier items together, and people can also register for things like cash and travel expenses. The company currently has 10 employees, and it just moved into the Galvanize co-working building in Seattle's Pioneer Square neighborhood. Though co-founders Shetty and Lizzy Ellingson both grew up in Seattle and graduated from the University of Washington, they met in New York City, during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Shetty started the company in 2013 when he was trying to furnish his New York apartment and found the process frustrating. Around the same time, Ellingson was preparing to get married and managing three different gift registries. That too, was a pain. So the two of them got to work figuring out a way to simplify gift registries. They said using room layouts as shopping tools paints a picture of how the gifts will fit into people's lives, creating a little more satisfaction for the giver. The company eventually moved from New York to Seattle. Ellingson had planned to move back here, and Shetty said Seattle is a better place to run a consumer-based startup than New York. Shetty comes from a finance background, where he worked on hedge funds, real estate securities and other investment types. Ellingson is a former Microsoft UX designer, and she has founded a couple other startups in her career. Blueprint has focused on weddings in the early going, but it is expanding out to include other big milestones that are often accompanied by loads of presents. Shetty said the next step for the company involves \"using Blueprint not only to help you with your wedding but also for baby showers, graduations and any new stage in your life.\" ",

(John Cook / GeekWire Photo)\n PALM DESERT, Calif.-- Silicon Valley may get all of the buzz, and most of the country's venture capital dollars. But AOL co-founder Steve Case thinks we need to get out of the Silicon Valley bubble, and talk more about entrepreneurship and what it means in different pockets of the country. \"We also think too much about Silicon Valley to be honest with you. I am proud of Silicon Valley. There are great things happening in Silicon Valley. Great things will continue to happen in Silicon Valley,\" said Case, who was speaking at the EY Strategic Growth Forum on Friday afternoon. \"But there are also great things happening in Detroit and Des Moines and Madison and Atlanta and New Orleans and Buffalo and Chicago, and all over the country. And we need to tell more of those stories, and we need to get more capital. Right now, most venture capitalists are lazy. They want to get in the car and drive to the entrepreneur.\" As far as Case is concerned, there are great entrepreneurial stories happening all over the country, but it tends to get overshadowed by Silicon Valley. And while companies such as WhatsApp may sell for $22 billion, the messaging service only employed about 55 people. Case said that's a great outcome, but a company that sold for $22 billion years ago would have employed 50,000 people or more. And there are amazing stories of entrepreneurship -- and job creation -- in other cities far from Silicon Valley's Sand Hill Road. In other words, there's more to entrepreneurship in his view than just the whopping exit. Case also pleaded with the entrepreneurs in the room to not only focus on building companies, but also investing in their communities. \"How do you create a stronger startup community?\" asked Case, adding that it is imperative for those entrepreneurs who've met with success to lift up others in the community. The comments by Case, chairman of venture capital firm Revolution and a member of the National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, echo the theme of more regional entrepreneurship that he's been touting under the mantra of \"rise of the rest.\" In fact, Case has been conducting \"rise of the rest\" bus tours where he's visited places like Pittsburgh, the once industrial powerhouse that's now turning into an epicenter for autonomous vehicle research. Uber and others are investing heavily in Pittsburgh, but Case said those stories don't get heard over the din of Silicon Valley. \"The arrogance that some have in Silicon Valley that naivete is a competitive advantage, if you know nothing about the sector you can look at it in a new way. There is some truth to that,\" said Case. \"But I actually think if you want to change health care, having some sense of what doctors and hospitals think, that makes sense. If you want to change education, having some sense of teachers and universities think, makes sense. If you want to change agriculture, having some sense of how farmers think about things and some of their challenges, makes sense. You need to do that all across the country, not just on the coasts.\" ",

The fresh funding comes from Alliance of Angels, Seattle Angel Fund, Bellingham Angel Investors, Tappan Hill Ventures, and other angel investors in the Seattle region. Founded in 2014 by Brice Kosnik and Jason Burt, BuildPulse has developed a plug-and-play cloud-based analytics platform that gives building operators data and insight about energy use. Kosnik previously led a building automation controls company. That experience showed him how clients had trouble not only managing huge amounts of data, but also with acting upon that information to improve efficiency for building and HVAC systems. \"Often times they are doing well, but just need some help finding opportunities and verifying changes,\" Kosnik explained. \"Automated reporting helps them make changes and measure the impact without having to be experts in data and analytics.\" The company's software can integrate with existing building automation systems, without the need for manual setup. Customers range from Fortune 500 companies to those in education and local government. Total funding to date for BuildPulse is $1.8 million. The company, which graduated from the 9MileLabs accelerator in 2014, employs eight people. It is similar to another Seattle startup, Optimum Energy, which raised $10 million last year. ",

      "content": "A website and app created with the Joy wedding planning technology. (Joy Photo)\n Seattle-based wedding planning startup Joy began almost by accident, as a side project by then-Microsoft employees Vishal Joshi, Michael Bach and Adobe engineer Kaiwalya Kher, after creating an early version of their technology for Bach's sister and the guests at her wedding. They ended up in Y Combinator through serendipity, when a partner at the prestigious Silicon Valley startup accelerator program contacted Joshi about acquiring a domain name, and ended up suggesting they go through the Y Combinator application process. They applied, and to their surprise, they were accepted. Joy was ultimately named one of the top 7 startups in its Y Combinator class by TechCrunch, and the company emerged from the program with $4.5 million in funding from well-known investors. But now the startup is preparing to make a very intentional move: Joy and its team will be relocating from Seattle to the Bay Area early next year. It's a strategic decision to position the company for growth in the competitive market for wedding planning technology and social tools for events. Joshi, the company's co-founder and CEO, joined us this week at the GeekWire office in Seattle for a conversation about the creation of Joy, its startup journey so far, the house the company rented during the Y Combinator program, Seattle vs. Silicon Valley, and where the company is headed next. Listen to the podcast below, or download the MP3, and continue reading for highlights. \nDespite the existence of big players in wedding planning technology, Joy sees a big opportunity to build something valuable. \"The wedding technology space is super-fragmented,\" Joshi said. \"That is the biggest issue. There are companies that have existed for decades, and the thing is that everything which is being built is not in some way connected.\" For example, he said, someone might use The Knot to build a wedding website, track a guest list on an Excel spreadsheet, call a relative to get their address to send the invitation, which probably doesn't match the wedding website, which doesn't match your app. For photographs by guests, a bride and groom might rely on an Instagram hashtag. Joy's technoloyg brings elements like that together into a single service. Of the company's planned move to the Bay Area, Joshi said, \"This is really bittersweet for us, because most of our families are here, everybody's family is here, and we are Seahawks fans, too. For the longest time in Silicon Valley I was wearing hiking shoes, and people would look at me like, 'What's going on?' \" He continued, \"We really like the Pacific Northwest a lot, but the truth is that here [in the Seattle area] the place is very attuned to high-tech stuff, cloud stuff, and for making a big company even bigger. For making a company which is something very small into something [bigger], the ecosystem around it is way less\" in the Seattle region. Joshi said they were ultimately swayed by the \"serendipity and the ecosystem around startups\" in Silicon Valley. For example, he recounted meeting an investor randomly in an UberPool, and one of the founders of Instacart at a home improvement store. Despite the presence of wealthy tech leaders such as Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Jeff Bezos in the Seattle region, Joshi said he doesn't see the same degree of investment, engagement or coaching as he does in the Bay Area. \"There are so many people around [in the Bay Area] who constantly can tell you, 'Oh, you're facing this particular situation in the life of your company, and this is how you can tackle it, or this is how I tackled it.' These people are available, very readily, to coach and mentor,\" he said. \"This very different coaching than how to become a VP at Microsoft, or how to become a VP at Amazon. That coaching, you have plenty [in the Seattle region]. Or how to become a really good technologist. That coaching is plenty. But how to take a company which is nothing into scenarios like how you're going to grow it, how you're going to reach out to people, what business model is really going to work, what has been tried and tested, those types of things are significantly better\" in the Bay Area. \"We still hope to come back here someday, with the hope that we get to a state where we have no doubts that we will survive,\" he said. \"When we get to that stage, then we want to come back.\" Of Joy's long-term aspirations, Joshi said, \"What we want to do is create this bridesmaid for you, who is really by your side and does everything about your wedding, not just one or two things, but everything about your wedding in one place.\" But their ambitions are bigger than that. \"People are starting to use Joy for a bunch of other things, like birthdays, vow renewals, musical events, sports events. We use Joy for our office. Our entire Joy journey is captured on Joy. So what we realized is that if you build a product which matches the event that is the highest-standard event of your life, which is your wedding, then all the other events can also be handled on Joy.\" Joy is available at withjoy.com. The app is available on iOS and Android. ",

The startup, founded by Seattle marketing vets Jess Waldeck, Michael Kimmons, and Marcus Tewksbury, helps shoppers earn a commission when they recommend products to friends online. It's a win for retailers, who know recommendations are a powerful marketing tool when harnessed. \"Unless you are already a very successful blogger or have a commissioned sales position, there isn't an easy way for you to earn money by recommending products,\" said Waldeck, Maven's CEO. \"We looked at that and asked, 'How do we enable sharing in a way that benefits everyone: not only the friend who gets great advice and the retailer who gets a new customer or sale, but also the person making the recommendation?' Users create lists of products (like Pinterest boards) from retailers in the Maven Exchange network. They can share them on social media channels and Maven's site. When friends click the link and buy the product, the \"maven\" earns a commission. \"Our goal is to give everyone a fun and easy way to earn by recommending products and services they love to other people,\" said Waldeck. \"People who have great taste or shopping expertise, 'mavens,' can earn doing something they already love doing.\" We caught up with Waldeck for this installment of Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"Maven lets people earn money by recommending products and services.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"We wish that we could say Maven came from an epiphany one night and work began the next morning. I can't imagine this is the case too often. We actually began our business experimenting with an online personal shopping prototype focused on tackling conversational commerce. Through this experience, we found a market segment with highly specific expertise interested in sharing and helping others. The prototype failed to provide these users a mechanism to earn at scale. We asked ourselves - 'How could we cultivate this passion and provide these users a more scalable way to earn?'\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Bootstrap. We have chosen to personally invest in our business to prove that we have market/product fit. That will let us approach investors with a more compelling opportunity that is clear and that has lower risk, with the investment focused on growth.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Personal referrals are the number one influencer of retail purchase decisions. Before Maven, these recommendations weren't rewarded. Now, our users can earn real money by recommending products and services. Not only does this drive retailer revenue but creates valuable user generated content from a trusted peer relationship. These recommendations are authentic and sincere, creating not only an earning tool but an asset for our business.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Choosing to do less so that we can do what we focus on well. We see a wide array of opportunities for our business. But in order to ensure our members have a great experience, we've maintained a focus on our core customer group and the features in the site they need for success. This has enabled us to deliver a great experience in the site and build loyalty.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Overinvesting in 'early' ideas. Though a great learning experience, we invested time and money in a prototype for an early idea that was not successful. The lesson learned was to calibrate the level of investment with the level of validation.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"That's a tough choice for us. We're retail focused but social media is our channel. What if we get both Zuckerberg as well as Bezos in our corner?!\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"It seems to be sharing cute baby pictures! People on our team seem to all be growing their families. So, we've had a lot of baby pictures shared on email and chat. I think it's slightly competitive!\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Employees at Maven have diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise. It is an absolute strength for us. When we're hiring, we look for skills and competence. But we're also looking for people who are comfortable engaging in discussions with strong and varying perspectives along with the ability to embrace and execute on the direction set once the decision is made.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Startups are exciting and challenging. One challenge is understanding priorities. If everything is a priority, nothing is. So, know what stage of development your business is at - from seed to startup to growth and expansion. Each stage has its own set of goals and priorities. For us, that has helped focus on the right things. And, it also puts successes and failures in the right context which makes it easier to manage through the inevitable ups and downs of a startup!\" ",

      "content": "Cole Brodman.\n Cole Brodman is taking on another leadership role in the telecom industry. The former T-Mobile executive, who spent 17 years at the wireless carrier and held positions as CMO and CTO, is now CEO of M87, a mobile networking startup that today announced a $5 million fundraising round led by Madrona Venture Group, with participation from Qualcomm Ventures and Trilogy Equity Partners. Brodman left T-Mobile in 2012 and spent the next four years as a board member for a handful of startups. One of those companies was M87, which launched out of Austin, Texas in 2014. M87's technology, born out of research done by founder Vidur Bhargava and Dr. Sriram Vishwanath at the University of Texas in Austin, helps wireless carriers improve network performance by creating dynamic device-to-device mesh networks. As Brodman spent more and more time advising the company, it eventually asked him to take on a leadership role. M87, which is also relocating its headquarters to the Seattle area -- home to decades of wireless infrastructure innovation -- sells two software products. The first is its Edge Network, which expands network capacity for wireless carriers without adding physical infrastructure. It does this by creating what the company calls \"proximate internet,\" which utilizes device-to-device discovery and improves connection in poor coverage areas. For example, imagine a large office building with hundreds of smartphone owners on the same wireless network. Those closer to the windows may have better signal, while those in other areas may have more spotty connections. M87's technology enables the carrier to use the devices with strong signals and improve service for those needing a faster connection. \"It turns every smartphone into a network relay to benefit other devices in the network,\" Brodman said. Brodman, who helped create innovative products at T-Mobile like hotspot destination networks and WiFi calling software, sees a huge opportunity for this technology given the increasing number of smartphone owners around the world. M87 appeals to a wide-range of clients given that it works with both Android and iOS, while utilizing multiple radio frequency technologies like Bluetooth, WiFi, and others. \"We are crowdsourcing radio coverage for consumers,\" Brodman explained. \"We do it safely and securely in conjunction with wireless carriers.\" The second product is a software development kit for app developers to enable device-to-device discovery and connectivity in a power efficient manner. It uses the same fundamental technology as the Edge Network, but is geared toward developers that want to add direct device discovery, communication, and location services to their apps. The SDK is ideal for social media, mobile advertising, messaging, search, and emergency services apps. For example, a messaging company could use M87's software to help users in the same vicinity connect with one another. Or, a merchant could provide information to customers within a given distance of its physical store. The idea is to make every smartphone a mobile, software-based beacon that can communicate with nearby devices, people, and other products using primarily WiFi, Bluetooth and BLE. \"We believe the ability to have continuous mobile discovery for each smartphone, not tied to physical locations or hardware, and have devices working together in a network application, can create opportunities for new applications to be created to discover proximate people, places, and things,\" Brotman said. App developers can create their own technology for device discovery and data transport, but it takes a lot of time and work to implement, Brodman added. \"To do this at a network scale across multiple radio technologies and multiple versions of iOS and Android, and have them all working together at scale in coordinated fashion, is quite difficult,\" he said. \"We remove the need for app developers to become wireless networking experts.\" Brodman, who graduated from the University of Texas and has lived in the Seattle region since 1995, said he's excited to get back into the \"operational world\" after spending time only as an investor. With M87, he's optimistic about how the company can improve the way smartphone owners access faster connections. \"It can be a really interesting business,\" said Brodman, who is also a partner at Bellevue-based Trilogy. \"There aren't a lot of solutions today to help wireless carriers solve coverage capacity problems and most require them to build new cell sites. I'm excited about software-based solutions to approach this problem.\" M87, which has raised more than $12 million to date, will use the fresh funding round to double its 8-person team by the first half of next year. It will also help the company, which got its name from a galaxy called Messier 87, scale its business and further develop the technology. \"Collectively, the M87 team has an exciting blend of experience and capabilities and we are fortunate that they are moving the company to Seattle,\" Madrona Managing Director Len Jordan wrote in a blog post. \"We will struggle to compete with their famous 'BBQ' but let's welcome them to the world of coffee, a little rain and a great startup ecosystem.\" ",

      "content": "Otogear earplug attachments.\n Madeline Bennett is driven by a passion for entrepreneurship and hearing science, so when she saw an opportunity to leverage her interests to solve a problem facing her peers, she jumped at it. She observed chronic noise-induced hearing loss that could be prevented if more people used hearing protection in loud environments. It inspired her to create a product to reduce the stigma around wearing earplugs. As part of a class project, Bennett developed a prototype for an earplug attachment that gives traditional hearing protection some style. Based on positive feedback from classmates and her professor, she decided to turn Otogear into a real startup, undaunted by the fact that she was still a junior in college at the University of Washington. \"I have a lot of family members that suffer from [hearing loss] which is why this project is really exciting for me,\" she said. \"It has the potential to create a new generation of hearing protection users because if kids want to use hearing protection, it will help protect them from noise-induced hearing loss in the future.\" The patent-pending Otogear earplug attachments come in a variety of styles and colors, \"like a phone case for your earplugs\" Bennett says. Otogear isn't Bennett's first entrepreneurial endeavor. In 2011, she founded Owl Be Better With Music, a non-profit that brings music to patients and families at Shriners Children's Hospital. She first became interested in music, speech, and hearing science as a child, after several years of speech therapy helped her overcome an articulation disorder. Bennett graduated from UW in May and recently left her day job to focus on Otogear full-time. Her team includes UW professor and audiologist Kelly Tremblay and former Disney exec Serina Rockwell. Her mother, Traci Bennett, runs operations, drawing on years of experience as a business consultant. Otogear is currently in the friends and family investment stage. Soon it will begin its first fundraising round and launch a Kickstarter campaign. The startup already has manufacturers lined up and plans to start selling in the next few months. Initially, the Otogear attachment will come with high-quality reusable earplugs that Bennett and her team have selected. \"We want to make sure whatever we provide with our Otogears is the best in the market so we do a lot of research in terms of which ones we pair with,\" said Bennett. In October, Otogear placed third in OSHA's national Hear and Now - Noise Safety Challenge in Washington D.C. The event was hosted by the U.S. Department of Labor. ",

(Courtesy Townhouse Tech)\n Scott Lipsky has a long history in Seattle as an entrepreneur and investor who has led a number of startups and successful companies. It's been five years since he launched his last company, and now he's back with a fresh idea that he thinks will radically alter the way people communicate using digital messaging. Townhouse Tech is the name of Lipsky's new company, and he's headquartered with a team of five in a townhouse that he owns a block off the West Seattle Junction. \"The name was literally just pulled out of the air the first day when I needed to create an account on Google,\" Lipsky told GeekWire this week. \"I just typed in Townhouse Tech and since that day the name just stuck. Everyone I mention the name to thought it was pretty cool and then I started hiring people and they're like, 'What's wrong with Townhouse Tech?'\" So Lipsky did a search to see if the domain name was available and it was and he took it as a sign that he should stick with his first instinct. Furthermore, he thinks it's a fun spin on a startup tradition. \"It's a new take on the garage company or the garage startup,\" Lipsky said. \"Next-generation garage startup is what Townhouse Tech is and that's really why people loved it.\" Lipsky knows that garage mentality all too well. He joined one of the world's most famous companies to have started in that fashion when Jeff Bezos hired Lipsky as vice president of business expansion at Amazon in 1996. Lipsky played a leading role in the online retailer's early growth. From there, Lipsky went on to co-found Avenue A / Razorfish (aQuantive) and served as chief technology officer of the leading digital marketing technology and services company -- which sold to Microsoft in 2007 for $6 billion. In 2003 he founded GalleryPlayer and in 2011 he launched PhotoRocket. So what's the big idea that has Lipsky excited about Townhouse Tech? He's not ready to reveal all just yet, but he did share the overarching goal of the ambitious startup. \"We're developing mobile apps and a cloud service that's pretty much going to revolutionize the messaging, communication and collaboration experience for consumers and businesses,\" Lipsky said. \"It's a really powerful cloud platform that will provide some really cool features for users as they're composing messages and emails and other content. It's something that everyone's mother and brother is going to use at home and something that everyone's coworker is going to use at work. And we're going to make this platform available not only to our own users of our app, but it's also going to be available to business partners to enable their users of their apps and their services to have the same great benefit.\" It sounds cool, but clearly anyone who has touched a computer or a phone knows there are already a host of different ways with which we can communicate with one another. Lipsky said it's not about being the must-have new messaging app -- it's about features his service will provide. \"We're not trying to compete with Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp,\" Lipsky said, to name a couple. \"What we're trying to do is create some features that people will use while they're text messaging. So we're not trying to come out with an app to compete with every other app in the world.\" Lipsky said the goal is for his features to be available wherever people are typing any type of content on a computer -- or thumbing content on mobile phones. He said he wants to help make content more useful and more informative and enhance the communication that people have with one another. Right now he's bootstrapping the project himself with a plan to launch the platform and the apps sometime in the summer of 2017. Lipsky said handling the funding frees him up to focus his time on building the technology and the business rather than raising money from angel investors. \"After we launch in the summer and after we prove that the technology and the business plan and the business model work as we predict, we will be going out for a venture round at that time,\" Lipsky said, adding that he has had a few local investors express interest at this early stage and that they could possibly come aboard during the development phase. The product and service won't carry the Townhouse Tech name. It will have an \"entirely different and very cool name and brand\" to be revealed closer to launch, Lipsky said. Right now, the five-person company is Lipsky, two engineers, and two startup vets who are handling the business side. He said he's currently hiring backend engineers to develop the cloud service as well as a director of technology. He figures the company will grow to nine or 10 employees to get to launch and will then grow from there as the business grows -- and outgrows the townhouse. On the company website, an add for software engineers says, \"You will play an essential role in our Backend-as-a-Service engineering practice, implementing a world-class cloud service that will be providing content/context services to tens of millions of simultaneous users.\" Lipsky said a lot has changed in five years in Seattle in regard to attracting people to tech jobs like those he's advertising. \"The city has changed so much when it comes to the growth and the recruiting,\" Lipsky said. \"Luckily, there are still plenty of people out there who want to work at startups and want to be at a small company and want to take much more ownership and be more relevant and have a bigger impact. I found four great ones so far.\" Lipsky's former boss Bezos and the wave of hiring his giant company is doing plays a part in what Lipsky has to contend with -- but not because they're going after the same worker necessarily. \"Trying to get our job descriptions and get the fact that we're hiring above the noise of 8,000 jobs at Amazon has been quite interesting,\" Lipsky said. \"That being said, if you're looking for a job at Amazon, you're probably not looking for a job at a startup. At least there's still a community of people who want to work with entrepreneurs or who are entrepreneurial, and there are still engineers who really prefer to be in a smaller group and have a much more direct, bigger impact.\" When asked whether Townhouse Tech has a ping pong table like any other startup in town, Lipsky laughed. \"No, but there is a hot tub on the roof.\" ",

The Seattle startup, which helps mobile app makers retain customers and boost reviews, today announced $3.6 million in funding led by existing investor Origin Ventures. Previous investor SurveyMonkey participated; Apptentive also raised cash from Vulcan Capital and Blossom Street Ventures. The round, technically a \"Series A-2,\" could extend to $5 million. Total funding for the 5-year-old company is now $10.3 million. Apptentive's SDK helps clients like Nordstrom, eBay, Zillow, Microsoft, Sonic, Major League Soccer, IHG, Viacom, power in-app surveys and rating/review prompts. The company, which graduated from Techstars Seattle in 2012, says it powers more than 25 million in-app customers interactions each month. The company's revenue has doubled year-over-year. Apptentive CEO Robi Ganguly told GeekWire that profitability was \"achievable\" this year, but the startup decided to invest more given the sales growth. \"When the world's largest companies clamor for your product in every touchpoint they have with consumers, it's a good feeling,\" he said.  Ganguly added that Apptentive helps companies \"understand their customers on a deep level.\" They can go from understanding what mobile customers are doing, to understanding why they think, feel, and act in certain way, he said. \"With the data, feedback, and rich customer insights our product provides, people in all areas of the business -- from product to consumer insights, marketing to executive leadership -- are able to do their jobs better by making more informed decisions that they can be confident align with their customers wants and needs,\" Ganguly explained. The fresh cash will be used to help grow the company's employee base from 30 to 55 over the next year. As a result of the funding, Origin Ventures Partner Brent Hill has joined Apptentive's board. Previous investors in Apptentive include Google Ventures, Founder's Co-op, Social Leverage, and Golden Venture Partners. ",

      "content": "Atlas Workbase opened its first location earlier this month. Photo: Atlas Workbase.\n A new co-working company just opened in Seattle, and its founder wants to rewrite the rules of a concept that is growing like crazy, but primarily targets only a few industries. Traditionally, co-working is thought of as a trend reserved primarily for the technology industry, a series of small flexible office spaces for startups getting their feet under them. Atlas Workbase is a co-working company that is aimed at everyone, from technology startups to more traditional businesses, to traveling workers who just need an office for a couple days. Atlas this month opened its first location, a 20,000-square-foot space with a variety of office and desk setups at 500 Mercer, just a few blocks west of Amazon's Seattle headquarters. Though it is starting small, the company headed by Bill Sechter has big ambitions. It is seeking to unseat WeWork as the company everyone thinks of when it comes to co-working. He referred to WeWork as the McDonalds of co-working, in the positive sense that it is the name synonymous with the industry. But he pitches his co-working hub as a more professional space that is designed for a greater variety of industries with more services for members. \"I picture a day when the typical business person will book an airline ticket, a hotel, a car, and their office,\" Sechter said. \"And the first thing they are going be thinking about for their office is Atlas Workbase.\" That's an audacious goal, and Atlas boasts some big-name partners to help make it happen. Its space is designed by Gensler, which has worked on offices for Microsoft and Tableau locally and designed big towers all over the world. Atlas has Philips Lighting providing controllable LED lighting throughout the building. And on-site will be a FedEx Office location that members can use for printing, shipping and many other needs. Sechter himself was once an executive at FedEx. Much of the furniture comes from Steelcase. Sechter said one of his big selling points is the place you spend the most time at work -- your chair or desk -- will be nicer at Atlas than any other co-working space. \"I have personally sat on every single chair and picked out every single chair over the last year and a half to make sure they were comfortable, looked good and provided the wellness that people expect,\" Sechter said. Though right now Atlas has just the one location, its goal is to have five in Seattle within the next two years and expand to Portland soon. Sechter and his business partner Alan Winningham are looking at possible Seattle locations on Capitol Hill and in Pioneer Square/Sodo. Sechter has global ambitions for the company, but first he wants to make sure he has the model right. \"We want to grow smart, but we're going to grow rapidly,\" Sechter said. \"As people come in the space and see what we are doing here, and I open up the market to people outside of the traditional co-working space, I am highly convinced that I've got the next Pet Rock, it's just a matter of how we implement it.\" Co-working suits companies demanding flexibility, but Sechter said Atlas is taking that to a new level. Atlas offers a variety of workspaces throughout the building, including individual desks, small and large conference rooms with soundproofing and customizable lighting, areas where someone can get privacy to work on a complex document and collaborative spaces as well. Atlas also offers different usage plans. A member can rent a space for full-time use, or about 40 hours a week, as well as part time deals that equate to about 20- and 10-hour per week usage. Atlas says it is priced competitively with other co-working companies like WeWork. Private desks at three WeWork locations in Seattle have starting prices ranging from $375 to $450 a month. At Atlas, full-time private desktop workstations start at just below $900 per month. Spots at shared tabletops start at $229 per month for quarter-time membership more private office spaces start at $379 per month for quarter-time use. In The Lounge, an area that aims to combine the look and feel of a business lounge with service of a high end club, prices start at $199 for quarter time use, and day passes are available for this area as well. Sechter's vibe is that of a salesman through and through. He did that for years before going back to school and earning an MBA at Seattle University. He compared himself to George Clooney's frequent-flying character in Up in the Air and said he has logged more than 9 million flying miles. That means he's also stayed in a lot of hotels. He used those experiences to conceive the ideas of a concierge service and an in-house IT group that helps people integrate their technology with Atlas'. Co-working is certainly a trendy concept, but the market has gotten rather crowded lately. Right now, WeWork is the big dog, with a reported valuation of $16 billion and 128 locations in 39 cities around the world. But there are plenty of other companies in the space as well. Desk Mag projects there will be more than 10,000 co-working spaces worldwide by the end of the year. In the Seattle area, approximately 50 co-working companies occupy close to 1 million square feet, and that's without counting a couple of new spaces for WeWork. The co-working giant is bringing its WeLive concept to Seattle, where it will occupy 200,000 square feet of office space in Martin Selig's 36-story Third & Lenora tower, and 384 apartments above will be WeLive units. WeWork is also adding locations in Bellevue, Wash. and the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. Sechter thinks the co-working trend is here to stay. He called it a natural extension of the technological improvements that have made it possible to work from anywhere. Sechter said he is glad WeWork is growing locally because it shows that the concept works. He compared it to Starbucks opening in small towns, wetting the appetites of residents by providing higher quality coffee than the typical diner. Now that they have gotten a taste, Sechter thinks people of all occupations, not just tech employees, will clamor for co-working opportunities. \"That's where I felt there was a blue ocean opportunity to create a space that would attract not only the bro coders and the people who are focused on technology and entrepreneurs, but your everyday American, your everyday person, who needs to work and conduct business,\" he said.

      "content": "TheSkimm co-founders Cary Zakin and Danielle Weisberg and moderator MJ Rogers of Chase for Business on stage at Seattle Startup Week. Photo: GeekWire's Monica Nickelsburg.\n TheSkimm's secret sauce is cleverly and playfully reframing the daily news in a way that resonates with its target demographic -- female young professionals. So it's fitting that the media company's origin story is a familiar startup fable, reimagined for the millennial woman. Instead of two guys in a garage we have two girls in a tiny Manhattan apartment, but the underlying theme is the same: Hustle, grit, and determination can take you from humble beginnings to blockbuster success. TheSkimm founders, Carly Zakin and Danielle Weisberg, shared their story and the \"shameless\" tactics they used to put their small media company on the map, at Seattle Startup Week Monday. The year was 2012. Zakin and Weisberg were living together in New York and working as producers for NBC News. They started to realize \"the traditional career path in media no longer existed\" and began brainstorming a news product that could fill the need of smart, busy millennials like them. Their answer was theSkimm, a daily email newsletter that boils down the need-to-know and want-to-know news for their target audience in the chatty voice of the founders. They came up with the name and Zakin bought Weisberg a $50 logo for her birthday, but they were still missing an essential piece: Readers. They had a rich vision, but no real money to execute. They decided to go into credit card debt together, which Zakin says \"was kind of like we got married\" and put their negative funds toward 22 American Apparel t-shirts with theSkimm's logo. \"We sent the t-shirts to our friends in New York, Chicago, L.A., Seattle, and Boston,\" Zakin said. \"We said please wear these where people will see you.\" They became the ultimate brand ambassadors. They wore head-to-toe Skimm-branded outfits and worked from coffee shops around the West Village where people would be sure to see them. They drove to universities throughout the Northeast, pretending to be co-eds handing out postcards in the quad. When their trendy fitness club, Equinox, accidentally sent an email to all 3,000 members, they considered it \"best day in the first three months.\" \"We were really good at networking and we had absolutely no shame -- because we had no money,\" said Zakin, adding later, \"we were both just trying to figure out a path. How do you turn a passion into something that can offer more financial independence and stability? I never would have thought of myself as an entrepreneur.\" Their grassroots tactics got the ball rolling but much of the initial legwork came from a small, engaged early following. Zakin and Weisberg had struck up a number of email penpal relationships with their initial readers when an advisor pointed out what a great resource they could be. They asked their subscribers to share theSkimm with ten friends, then five more, and so on. That was the genesis of the Skimm'bassador program - a marketing initiative that encourages readers to evangelize theSkimm in exchange for a community, connections to SkimmHQ, and swag. Today, theSkimm has over 16,000 Skimm'bassadors, who have contributed to 19 percent of user growth since the program launched. The Daily Skimm email newsletter has more than 4 million subscribers, the majority of which are millennial women with spending power. The business is profitable thanks to advertising and Skimm Ahead, a for-purchase app with info on upcoming events and milestones. \"I think it's kind of like, we were journalists by passion; we were entrepreneurs by default,\" said Weisberg. \"We didn't know how to turn that passion into something that we could really scale and hit those goals that we had for ourselves, for our future. Once we became entrepreneurs, the only thing we could see is success because that's the only option you have.\" ",

Credit: Ad Lightning.\n Scott Moore, a 20-year veteran of online publishing for the likes of Microsoft, Yahoo and Cheezburger, has found his next venture. Ad Lightning scans digital publishing outlets for disruptive ads that slow down and hurt their sites. The idea for the company came out of Seattle-based startup incubator Pioneer Square Labs, and when Moore heard about it, his first thought was \"I wish we had this\" at Cheezburger. The company has been in stealth mode for the past few months, but came out of it this week, announcing a $2 million seed round led by Sinclair Digital Ventures, an investment division of Sinclair Broadcast Group. The selection of Moore, who sold Cheezburger earlier this year, was also announced this week. Pioneer Square Labs founders Mike Galgon, Greg Gottesman and Geoff Entress are also investors. In an interview with GeekWire, Moore said digital publishers have less control over the ads that show up on their sites than they used to. That is because of a concept known as programmatic advertising. Moore explains it as a kind of matchmaking service, where publishers pitch their audience and demographics and the systems matches them with advertisers that fit their budget and want access to those types of readers. \"There's a growing realization that programmatic, while it's been an incredible boon for marketers and advertisers, has created a lot of unintended consequences that are harming the very user experiences and consumer engagements that these advertisers and their agencies need in order to get their marketing messages delivered,\" Moore said. Many Cheezburger users installed ad-blocking software to avoid bad ads that slowed down the site, Moore said, and that cut into the company's revenue stream. Some of the most frequent problematic ads are those that are so large that they require an excess of processing power to load them and those with video or audio that start up unprompted. Since these ads pop up in response to a specific user's cookies, it is tough to recreate those conditions. \"If you're a user and you're having a poor user experience on a website because of ads, you don't really care whether it's the ads or the publisher's fault or whatever, you just get frustrated and you leave,\" Moore said. That's where Ad Lightning comes in. It monitors the site in the background at all times and shows which ads are troublesome. Then it's up to the publishers to decide if they want to shut down bad ads. Though Moore wouldn't get into the size of his staff, he did note that he brought in veteran software developer and executive Drake Callahan to be CTO and Kate Reinmiller, former COO of Mixpo, to be vice president of operations soon after he came on board. The company will use the investment funds to hire more people and find more customers. In the short-term, growing the business and landing more customers is the goal, but the company has grander visions. In the future, Moore said he believes it will be possible to build a database that tracks and monitors all digital advertising content floating around the internet. Since there is a finite amount of ads, and they tend to run for several weeks, tracking them wouldn't be too tough. \"If we can, over time, build a database of all the creative floating around through programmatic inventory and then quality score it, that becomes a really valuable asset we can license to many different players in the industry,\" Moore said.

Today, Gulati's firm -- known as Tola -- disclosed that it has closed on a $295 million growth-oriented venture fund. That follows previous fundraising efforts, and brings total capital raised across Gulati's firm to $341 million.  That's a huge amount of capital for a Seattle-based fund, but Gulati says it speaks to the opportunity that her team is trying to attack. Gulati says she's especially excited about the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the role those technologies will play in future enterprises. Software and data is \"changing every part of business,\" something that Gulati said her investors deeply understood while on the fundraising trail. \"We are investing in the next generation of enterprise computing, as fueled by the innovations in cloud, data, and mobile technologies,\" Gulati told GeekWire. \"We want to help enterprises use software and data to more effectively serve their customers; the predictive value of data is an incredible enabler for business.\" And while Gulati is rooted in Seattle -- a city whose leadership in machine learning and cloud computing stands above most -- she's not limiting her investments to the Pacific Northwest. In fact, Gulati said the firm will invest in companies across North America and Europe. \"We are hypothesis-based investors and look for companies that have strong traction within their target customer segment,\" said Gulati, who has made five investments from the new fund. It typically invests in the range of $5 million to $25 million. Gulati previously served as general manager of application platform and developer marketing at Microsoft, and before that led U.S. developer and platform evangelism. She's joined on the Tola team by Stacy Girard, who previously worked on the server and tools team at Microsoft. The new funding was provided by endowments, family offices and private foundations. ",

      "content": "From left to right: Socedo CEO Aseem Badshah; 9Mile Labs co-founder Sanjay Puri; Poppy CEO Avni Patel Thompson; Ripl CEO Paul Ingalls; WiBotic CEO Ben Waters; and BitTitan CEO Geeman Yip.\n It's not easy to bootstrap your startup. But for those who are able, the short and long-term benefits can be plentiful. Five founders from the Seattle startup community participated in a panel discussion Monday at Seattle Startup Week, sharing insight and advice for other entrepreneurs interested in building companies from the ground up without taking on substantial initial outside investment. One of the region's more recent examples of bootstrapped success is BitTitan and its founder Geeman Yip, who raised $15 million in June after operating the cloud technology company for nine years on its own funds. Yip on Monday admitted that he is \"biased toward bootstrappers\" and noted that it's not the right path for every startup. But he said one real benefit from building a company without outside investment is that it forces founders to be \"good financial engineers.\" \"When it comes down to figuring out how your money works for you -- whether it's paying interest or making revenue -- it's very important, because every dollar counts,\" Yip told the crowd at Impact Hub in downtown Seattle. Yip certainly went down unconventional paths to help support his business over the past several years. For example, after BitTitan generated a substantial amount of cash, he invested in real estate just after the 2008 downturn, buying up townhouses and corporate housing buildings. Yip thought he could make a 20 percent return, and sure enough, that's what happened years later. But it was about more than just a good investment; BitTitan ended up utilizing that real estate for employees to use. It all goes back to \"how you engineer a financial situation,\" Yip said, adding that bootstrapping helps founders build solid financial habits. \"You don't take anything for granted,\" he said. \"You really look at everything as your own money, because it is your own money. You're constantly thinking, can I spend this dollar in a different way?\" Here are some of the other takeaways from the panel discussion, which included Socedo CEO Aseem Badshah, Ripl CEO Paul Ingalls, 9Mile Labs co-founder Sanjay Puri, Poppy CEO Avni Patel Thompson, and WiBotic CEO Ben Waters. Badshah bootstrapped Socedo, a Seattle-based online marketing startup, for three years before landing a $1.5 million round in January. Socedo's technology was actually born inside a Los Angeles-based agency; Badshah and his co-founders spun out the startup in 2012 and moved the company to Seattle. One piece of advice from Badshah, and something he wished Socedo did earlier, is to focus on generating revenue. It's how you figure out whether or not your product or service is actually valuable, he said. It also buys your company freedom. \"From there, every financial instrument you look at is an instrument to take you to the next level, not to just survive,\" Badshah noted. Puri, who spent the past 3-and-a-half-years running the 9Mile Labs accelerator -- which is now pivoting -- said a lot of startups that raise big initial financing rounds spend money on sometimes-unnecessary perks. It can also lead to over-hiring, forcing CEOs to come up with \"random projects\" that can suck up valuable time and energy. \"Being able to monitor where every single penny is going, and whether you're spending it strategically, is an extremely important skill to have,\" Puri said. Puri added that not every business or startup can bootstrap. \"Use a combination of mentors and use the concept of growth -- let that be the North Star that helps you figure out if you should bootstrap,\" Puri said. \"If you do go down the bootstrapping route, just remember as an entrepreneur, you are too optimistic. Everything is going to take twice the amount of time and money. Be realistic.\" Thompson started Poppy, an on-demand childcare service, with just $180 in her bank account leftover after her first unsuccessful startup. She gave herself four weeks to get 100 paying customers. \"I didn't have a lot of time,\" she said. \"If customers wanted it, they would pay for it.\" The lack of a financial safety net forced Thompson to really hone in on what her customers wanted. \"It gets you focused on being so close to the customer, and building a product that actually delivers value,\" she said. That led to initial growth -- and showing that growth helped Thompson eventually land investment from angel investors. \"I just wanted to grow 10 percent per week -- it doesn't sound like a lot, but it really does add up,\" she said. \"In 12 to 15 weeks, I had enough to go back to my angel connections in the city and say that I'm on to something.\" When it comes to figuring out if you should survive on your own cash or reach out to investors, Ingalls said it's important to understand how much risk goes with each option. That means talking with your co-founder, your colleagues, and perhaps most importantly, your family. \"When you start a company, make sure you understand why you're starting it and what your goals are,\" he said. \"There are a lot of ways to raise money, and your goals -- whether you are trying to help your family be comfortable or trying to go for a big tech IPO -- can determine various funding vehicles you take. The risk-reward routes of various funding mechanisms are very different.\" ",

      "content": "9Mile Labs co-founders Kevin Croy and Sanjay Puri.After three-and-a-half years of running an accelerator that graduated six cohorts with nearly 60 companies, 9Mile Labs is putting an end its 3-month startup program. But the Seattle-based organization will continue making investments -- just not via the traditional accelerator model. 9Mile Labs has decided to stop running its own cohorts. Instead, it will invest money from its funds into startups that are participating in other top accelerators around the country. Sanjay Puri, who co-founded 9Mile Labs with Kevin Croy and Sandy Sharma in 2012, told GeekWire that the shift will help the firm scale faster and use a lower cost structure. 9MileLabs co-founder Sanjay Puri speaks at Demo Day last month in Seattle. (GeekWire photo)Puri explained that 9Mile Labs considered increasing the number of companies it accepted into its accelerator and the amount of money it invested. But the founders saw more efficient growth opportunities with this new model that lets 9Mile Labs invest in a larger pool of geographically diverse startups, while also removing the need to maintain a physical space, employ staff, or put on Demo Day events. It also offers more flexibility, as the deal flow window is now open throughout the year, versus only for specific cohorts. The general idea is to take advantage of the experience gained and connections made over the past few years running its own accelerator, and use that to support this new model. 9Mile Labs is now somewhat of an angel investment group with a focus on B2B startups in accelerators. \"We love what we've done over the past three years,\" Puri said. \"But we always talk about, how do we continue to (refine) the accelerator model? Five years from now, it won't be what it is today. It will continue to evolve. We want to stay ahead of the curve.\" 9Mile Labs, which had its most recent Demo Day last month, is already in conversations with several accelerators around the U.S. It will still target pre-seed stage B2B and enterprise startups, much like it did for its own accelerator. Previously, 9Mile Labs would invest anywhere from $35,000 to $105,000 in exchange for 7 to 10 percent of a startup's equity, while providing workspace, connections, and more. Now the firm will invest between $50,000 to $100,000 in a startup, with the valuation dependent on specific accelerators and terms. Croy noted that 9Mile Labs will be taking smaller overall stakes in individual companies, \"but we are mitigating some of the risk,\" he added. Puri said that the new model will help fill a funding gap for early stage startups in the growing number of accelerators. \"There is an explosion of accelerators across the country,\" he said. \"It's a real investment class. We believe there is a big gap for these companies, from when they enter the accelerator and when they raise their next round.\" From their own experience, and from speaking to managing directors at other accelerators, Croy and Puri say having an established external investor visit portfolio companies at an accelerator and make seed investments in an efficient manner is a win-win for all stakeholders. \"We understand and appreciate how valuable an entrepreneur's time is,\" Croy said. \"We meet with them for an hour and get back to them within three business days with a yes or no.\" With the new model, Puri said that 9Mile Labs is able to \"cherry pick from a pre-filtered set\" of startups, given that the accelerators have done their due diligence. 9Mile Labs will also continue to do its own vetting, both of accelerators and startups. \"This model allows us to leverage those relationships we've already built with accelerators,\" Puri added. 9Mile plans to fuel new investments as part of the new model from its existing fund, and has communicated the change to its backers. The firm will keep its name and some office space in Seattle's Galvanize building. ",

      "content": "Vacasa CEO and co-founder Eric Breon.\n Vacasa has raised another $5 million to help fuel growth of its vacation rental platform. The Portland startup pulled in a $35 million round this past April, and on Monday announced another $5 million from investor Assurant in an expansion of its Series A round. Vacasa bills itself as the \"largest dedicated vacation rental management company in the U.S.\" and offers a bevy of services -- marketing, rate optimization, reservations, guest services, housekeeping, maintenance, etc. -- to help homeowners earn money off their property. The 7-year-old company had bootstrapped since launching in 2009 before announcing the $35 million round earlier this year, which is the highest for a Portland-based company since Puppet Labs raised $40 million in June 2014.  One differentiating aspect of Vacasa is its on-the-ground local staff in cities around the world that help with everything from property managers to housekeeping to maintenance professionals. It also uses a proprietary yield management technology that updates price rates daily based on hundreds of variables like weather, events, competitor pricing and occupancy, regional demand trends, season demand curves, and more. Vacasa makes money by charging each property owner a fee in exchange for the management help. There are more than 4,100 properties on the platform. Vacasa will use the new money to expand around the world and double its workforce in 2016. In June, the company moved into a new 40,000 square foot office in Portland, where it employs 300. Vacasa also has 100 employees in Boise, and another 1,000 spread across 14 U.S. states and five countries. ",

      "content": "Brian Bosche and Dan Bloom of Slope pitch during GeekWire Startup Day.\n Are you an entrepreneur looking for seed money to get your startup off the ground? Consider approaching angel investors, who often step in to fill the gap between funding from family and friends and Series A funding from a venture capital firm. Because angels invest their own money, they're frequently more willing to back a risky, unproven idea than professional investors. Many angels are retired executives or successful business owners who take an active interest in a startup and its founders, and strive to add value based on their professional expertise and business network. While venture capital firms tend to be concentrated in a handful of major cities, angel investors are located across the country. Some angels invest on their own, while others organize themselves into angel groups such as the Alliance of Angels, Element 8 and the Puget Sound Venture Club. If you're planning to raise money from angel investors, here are some suggestions that will help improve your chances of success: Angel investors are entrusting you with their personal cash savings. Show that you are a steadfast individual who will be a good steward of their money. It is better to accurately characterize the status of your company than to try to impress investors with grandiose claims. The moment you are less than forthright with facts, investors will walk away. Customers buy a product because it solves a need, not because of a rich feature set. Discuss the benefits of your product and the burning pain point it addresses. Don't start by trying to tell investors everything you can about your company. Focus on the highlights, and help them connect the dots on how you're going to build a game-changing business. By getting to the point quickly and succinctly, you are demonstrating that you value investors' time, and that you will show similar respect to your team members, partners, and customers. A top-down market analysis often relies on subjective, broad-brush assumptions and may not deliver a convincing estimate. The bottom-up approach substantiates your domain expertise and is often better anchored to customer demand and market realities. If there is no competition, chances are there is no market, and thus no business. Describing your competitive advantage and/or barriers to entry is an effective way to communicate how you will win in this market. Your assumptions should be well thought out and attainable, though on the aggressive side. This is your opportunity to demonstrate nuanced business judgment and the scale of your ambition. Disconnects between market size, pricing, and financial projections are unlikely to impress investors. They may signal the lack of operational excellence and attention to detail that are crucial to building an iconic business. Most angel investors only have so many dollars to invest in startups, with lots of companies vying for that investment. If your proposed deal terms are significantly out of line with what other startups are offering, many investors will rather pass rather than risk antagonizing you by negotiating. Yi-Jian Ngo is the Managing Director at Alliance of Angels, a group of 140 angel investors who invest $10M into 20 Pacific Northwest startups each year. ",

      "content": "Eric Ringer is a drone photographer and co-founder of drone software startup Skyward.\n Eric Ringer wears a lot of hats. On any given day, his role could be R&D engineer, product manager, drone operations consultant, or flight operations specialist. His official title is Co-founder and Strategic Projects Engineer of Skyward but, in the startup world, your official title rarely covers everything. \"As is common in startups, I've filled a lot of different roles since we started this journey several years ago,\" Ringer said. \"Since I came on full time about a year and a half ago I have been working with our CTO, whose name is X, driving innovation and drone operations knowledge deeper into our product.\" Skyward is a Portland-based startup that builds operations software for commercial drone operators. Ringer is an avid drone photographer but also knows how to maintain divisions between work and home life. We caught up with him to hear his tips for keeping it all in balance for our regular Working Geek feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Current Location: \"Portland, Oregon\n\" Computer types: \"MacBook Air 13\" Mobile devices: \"Nexus 5X running Android Nougat on Project Fi\" Favorite apps, cloud services, and software tools: \n\"I started to list them out by the function I use them for but most of my favorite apps are used in both personal and professional environments. \nSlack is essential for cross platform communication with teams at work, my family, and my community group at church. Inbox from Google helps me execute my \"inbox as task list\" strategy. Strava is a beautiful, feature-rich platform for tracking and analyzing workouts and connecting with other active folks. yEd helps me communicate what's going on in my head to others. I really love maps so Google Earth, DroneDe ploy, and DataMapper Inflight are all great for different reasons: Google Earth for location scouting and flight path viewing, and DroneDeploy and DataMapper Inflight for collecting imagery with my DJI Phantom 3 and turning it into useful maps and 3D models. Finally, I use Adobe Lightroom and Instagram to edit and share my aerial photography.\" Describe your workspace. Why does it work for you? \n\"My primary workspace is a standing desk. It works for me because it forces me to be mindful of my posture and prevent a recurring hip injury I've dealt with from sitting too much. Our office hammock is nice when I'm tired of standing! It provides an easy change of environment that I sometimes need to stay productive.\" Your best advice for managing everyday work and life?  1. I start every work day with some alone time prior to diving into any meetings. During that time I review the tasks I want to get done for the day and read through my email. 2. I treat my inbox as a task list. If there is an email in there it is because I have action on it. I try to be real with myself about whether I will actually take that action soon. If I won't, I'll dismiss the email and have Google remind me about it at a time when it would be more relevant or a higher priority. Inbox zero is the goal. 3. I try to schedule as much as I can in advance and be forward with friends, family, and coworkers about when I'm available in that respective role. 4. My wife and I take a Sabbath one day every weekend where we do no work and ideally get outside to hike, camp, bike, or run. Respecting that day gives us dedicated time for each other and is pretty important for emotional and spiritual health.\" Your preferred social network? How do you use it for business/work? \"Instagram. I love the content there, the way you can curate your own feed, and the feature communities around so many different topics. Since I work in drones, live in the beautiful northwest, and love to fly, I get to share my own content there as well. It's a fun creative outlet for me that has also helped me build my work network. I'm eric.t.ringer on Instagram. Check out my work and let me know what you think!\" Current number of unanswered emails in your inbox? \"0 unread, 4 unactioned.\" Number of appointments/meetings on your calendar this week? \"17'' How do you run meetings? \"It depends on the purpose of the meeting, but determining that purpose is step one. For any meeting I run, I facilitate the conversations necessary to reach the desired outcome. To get there it starts with creating an agenda and making sure folks have the information they need to come prepared. I hate doing work in a room full of people that one person could do on their own. Everyone gets meeting fatigue so I try to keep things focused on what we want to get out of the meeting and stick to the agenda.\" Everyday work uniform? \"Dark raw denim jeans, bright Nikes, dark t-shirt.\" How do you make time for family? \"My wife is in grad school for nutrition so I keep a copy of her class schedule in my Google calendar. She's an excellent cook, and a joy to be around (hear that, Love?), so I make sure I'm home for dinner every evening and if I can't be there I try to give her enough of a heads up. We have our own Slack team so she and I can easily talk in the same environment that I'm in coordinating with everyone else at Skyward. And as I said above, we take a Sabbath day every weekend.\" Best stress reliever? How do you unplug? \"There are two major ways I unplug. First, Netflix. We're in the golden age of television after all, right? Second, triathlon training. I have to have something to focus on in my personal life aside from work in order to relieve stress. Because startup life can be so up and down, a structured program of self-improvement helps me feel like I'm making progress in life, independent of how things are going at work (it's kind of like diversifying my goals for success). Triathlon has been really good for that.\" What are you listening to? \"Lately, I've really been enjoying Joseph's new album, 'I'm Alone, No You're Not'.\" Daily reads? Favorite sites and newsletters? \"Most of my daily reading is to keep up with what's happening in the drone industry. In the mornings I skim Politico's Morning Transportation report and my Twitter drone industry list. If I have some time around lunch I'll see if Vox.com, FiveThirtyEight, or Kentucky Sports Radio (I'm a Kentucky boy) has anything that piques my interest.\" Book on your nightstand (or e-reader)? \"I've got three going right now. Celebration of Discipline by Richard Foster and The Well-Built Triathlete by Matt Dixon are on my nightstand (well, really on the floor next to my bed) and I've got Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy by Eric Metaxas on Audible for listening while running.\" Night owl or early riser? What are your sleep patterns? \"Early riser. I'm usually in bed by 10 p.m. or 10:30 p.m. and awake between 5:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m., even on weekends.\" Where do you get your best ideas? \"My best ideas never come when I'm trying to have good ideas. They seem to always come when I'm doing something else so when I get a good idea I try to get to Slack or Wunderlist right away to jot it down. That way I can easily return to the idea when I'm able to do something with it.\" Whose work style would you want to learn more about or emulate? \"Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough to work with and learn from some really great people who have influenced my work style. For example, I have a lot of admiration for people who are able to both focus intensely on one task and meet the needs of those around them. Our COO, Mariah Scott, does this quite gracefully and can quickly transition from silently working through a task to problem-solving with her team. I also admire people who successfully balance their professional, personal, and family goals. I was very fortunate to learn some valuable lessons in balance from former Patagonia CEO Michael Crooke while I was in the Oregon MBA program. Professional triathlete and Picky Bars co-founder and CEO Jesse Thomas is also quite good at this. ",

      "content": "Seattle 10 startup winner from 2015 Spare5 works on their cocktail napkin.\n From the brick walkways of Pioneer Square to the funky facades of Fremont, there's a lot of startup action in Seattle. So trying to identify the 10 hottest entrepreneurial ventures in the region is no easy task. But that's what we've set out to do with this year's class of The Seattle 10, which we're hosting again in partnership with the Museum of History & Industry. This year's list showcases 10 of the most promising startups in the region, and their business concepts span a variety of industries, from education and enterprise software to virtual reality and robotics. Yes, the Seattle startup scene is alive and well. But this year's list goes much further than simple recognition. We're putting our entrepreneurs to work, asking each of The Seattle 10 winners to reproduce their business ideas on giant six-foot by six-foot cocktail napkins that will be unveiled for the first time at the GeekWire Gala on Dec. 7th at MOHAI. This marks the fourth year that we've partnered with MOHAI on this fun activity, and we're once again excited to see what the startups concoct. We've already heard that some of the teams are hard at work devising their artistic creations, and we assume that this will get a little competitive as the startups try to outdo each other. If you have not already, make sure to grab your tickets for the GeekWire Gala, and come out to see these wonderful creations, applaud the Newsmakers of Year and participate in the geekiest holiday party on the planet. We received dozens of fantastic nominations this year, making it an especially challenging task for our illustrious panel of judges -- Madrona Venture Group's Julie Sandler, angel investor Gary Rubens, Techstars Seattle director Chris DeVore, angel investor Heather Redmand, Pioneer Square Labs co-founder Ben Gilbert and MOHAI executive diretor Leonard Garfield-- to help pick the winners. In order to qualify, companies had to be based in the Seattle area with a world-changing business idea. Without further ado, let's meet this year's class of the Seattle 10, presented by GeekWire and MOHAI. Auth0 may not be the best known startup, or the easiest to understand. But if you ask venture capitalists for an objective take on the hottest startups in the region, this Bellevue based company -- a maker of identity and authentication technologies -- often rises to the top of the list. Led by former Microsoft manager Jon Gelsey, the three-year-old startup combines existing login and identity verification options into a few lines of code that developers can quickly add to their applications. The goal? Create a \"zero friction identity and access management solution for cloud-hybrid applications and APIs.\" \"We built Auth0 because we were annoyed about how hard it was to integrate identity into apps,\" Gelsey told us in 2014. \"As identity experts, we knew it didn't have to be that hard.\" Previously on GeekWire: Auth0 raises $15M from Trinity Ventures and others to bolster its identity platform Let's face it, we need more computer scientists and engineers. Coding Dojo wants to help solve that problem, operating coding bootcamps in Seattle, Dallas, Silicon Valley, Washington D.C., Chicago and LA. It offers courses in Python, Ruby and other programming languages. teaching students the basic of coding in just 14 weeks. CEO Richard Wang has big ambitions for the Bellevue-based company. \"We often say that we're in the business of transforming lives -- not just teaching coding,\" Wang told GeekWire last year. \"We're setting our goals high and hope to transform the lives of 1 million people through programming literacy by 2025.\" Previously on GeekWire: Coding Dojo bootcamp hopes to 'transform lives' with programming classes When you think of technology, the trucking industry is not the first thing that comes to mind. But those big rigs on the road transport most of the goods in our homes and businesses, and making sure they get from point A to point B as seamlessly as possible is the goal of Convoy. The Seattle startup matches truck drivers and trucking companies with shippers to coordinate freight shipments. Not the sexiest industry, but one that's estimated at some $800 billion in the U.S. Convoy has raised some big-time money, from big-time backers. Silicon Valley venture capital firm Greylock Partners, Jeff Bezos' investment company Bezos Expeditions and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman participated in the company's $16 million round in August. CEO Dan Lewis, who previously served as general manager of new shopping experiences at Amazon and worked at Google and Microsoft, hopes to bring efficiency to the trucking business. \"We handle everything from end-to-end, taking care of them, handling customer support, getting the truck where it needs to be at the right time,\" says Lewis. Previously on GeekWire: Q&A: Convoy CEO Dan Lewis on lessons learned from Amazon, and disrupting the trucking industry M3 Biotechnology is developing advanced therapeutics to wipe out neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's. It's a big idea, driven by founder and CEO Leen Kawas who earned a degree in molecular pharmacology from Washington State University in 2011. This up-and-coming biotech upstart is making good strides. In tests on animals, M3 said its compound has reversed both cognitive and motor deficits around neurodegenerative diseases. \"Where current therapies primarily address disease symptoms, M3 has patented ... proprietary technologies differentiating itself to create disease-modifying treatments with the potential to restore lost connections between brain cells, turning degeneration into regeneration,\" the company says. M3 got a big boost earlier this year when it pulled in $10 million in funding, including cash from W Fund, Washington Research Foundation, and others. Previoulsy on GeekWire: Alzheimer-fighting M3 Biotechnology closes $10 million funding round Manuel Medina is on a mission to make it easier for sales teams to do their jobs. The CEO of Outreach is well on his way to that goal, with thousands of customers and recent war chest of funding from big names in venture capital. \"Our vision is to completely transform the way sales professionals communicate by streamlining traditionally manual processes and using data to optimize the effectiveness of every sales activity,\" Medina told GeekWire last year. Outreach employs 120 people, up from about 80 employees earlier this summer. Previously on GeekWire: Outreach sales tech startup raises $17.5M, adds Trinity and Microsoft as investors Forest Key wants to make sure virtual reality lives up to the hype, and at Pixvana his team wants to make sure all virtual reality experiences look amazing. \"With virtual reality video, people will tell new kinds of stories and it will require unique technology,\" Key told us last year. A veteran in the Seattle startup ranks, Key previously co-founding online travel upstart Buuteeq, which sold to Priceline Group in 2014. Previously on GeekWire: Ex-Buuteeq CEO Forest Key raises $6M for virtual reality video processing startup Pixvana Poppy founder Avni Patel Thompson agrees that it takes a village to raise a child. But with careers and education taking parents away from home, families need access to a trusted community. That's where Poppy steps in, which is operating a marketplace to help parents screen and find baby sitters and nannies. \"Poppy believes that every family deserves a village and her mission is to use data and technology to connect every family to theirs,\" said Patel Thompson. Previously on GeekWire: Poppy raises cash, expands on-demand childcare service in Seattle region A lot of people laughed when venture capitalist Greg Gottesman started Rover.com at a Startup Weekend event, noting that an online pet sitting service was not a legitimate business. Well, Rover is the one laughing now, as the company has emerged as an unexepected giant in the online pet sitting marketplace. Just last month, Rover reeled in $40 million in fresh funding, and CEO Aaron Easterly said it was on the path to an IPO. Founded in 2011, Rover has now raised $91.5 million and the 170-person company continues to grow its platform, which now helps 65,000 pet sitters across 10,000 U.S. cities book more than one million services per quarter. In August, the company said that during the first half of this year, it surpassed an annual run rate of $100 million in gross billings. Previously on GeekWire: Rover raises $40M as dog-sitting platform eyes IPO and aims for profitability Usermind is not the easiest concept to understand, and even the company's marketing team has challenges explaining it to family and friends. But the company is solving a big need for enterprises, helping them integrate business functions and unify data across teams. \"I wanted to see if I could take a passionate idea I had and build a great company from scratch,\" CEO Michel Feaster told GeekWire shortly after founding Usermind in 2013. Feaster likens her enterprise software company to an orchestra conductor who manages different musical instruments and is required to have them all playing together in harmony. Those instruments, in this example, are analogous to the various standalone enterprise applications a given company uses -- along with the finance, sales, marketing employees -- that help serve customers in today's digital world. Previously on GeekWire: Menlo Ventures leads $14.5M round for Usermind, an enterprise business operations startup WiBotic provides reliable wireless power to charge aerial, mobile and aquatic robot systems. Yeah, cool stuff. Originally founded within the University of Washington's electrical engineering and computer science departments, the year-old company is just emerging from stealth mode. \"WiBotic is creating the infrastructure for robots to charge whenever and wherever-- so companies can focus on robot tasks rather than keeping their robots charged,\" WiBotic CEO and co-founder Ben Waters says. \"Enabling better access to power and autonomous charging opens up a whole new world of possibilities for robots.\" Previously on GeekWire: This University of Washington spin-out can charge robots and drones wirelessly  ",

      "content": "The KeepKey bitcoin wallet.\n Darin Stanchfield believes the future of bitcoin depends on security. The crypto-currency has a lot of potential, he says, but only if it can be reliably protected from cyber attacks. That's why he created KeepKey, a device to protect bitcoins from theft. \"When people first learn about Bitcoin, it is usually from stories involving theft,\" said Stanchfield. \"Handling digital currencies requires near-perfect security, which is hard for most engineers let alone regular consumers.\" Stanchfield founded the Kirkland, Wash. startup in 2014 after Mt. Gox, the world's largest bitcoin exchange, lost $600 million worth of customers' bitcoins due to hacking. In May, KeepKey acquired the software wallet company MultiBit and in August the company made an integration deal with ShapeShift to allow customers to securely swap bitcoins on the KeepKey device. \"That decision has led to many doors opening for us and new customers for our services,\" said Stanchfield. GeekWire caught up with Stanchfield for this installment of Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"KeepKey is a digital vault that securely stores digital currencies like bitcoin. Once currencies are on the device, they can only be spent by the owner who knows the password. It is like Fort Knox for bitcoin, but tiny and can fit in your hand. You can plug the device into a virus and malware infected computer, and your funds remain entirely safe.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"We were passionate about the promise that digital currencies like bitcoin had for our future. But after the MtGox heist, we realized that the big hurdle for newcomers was learning how to handle their digital assets securely.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"As the founder, I chose to bootstrap. Bootstrapping defines the culture early on of doing a lot with very little.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"I wouldn't call it a secret, but we focus on the customer. We are determined to make sure that everyone that purchases our product has a good experience. We also embrace potential customers, helping with the often bitcoin-confused questions we get when people dial our support by mistake.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Earlier this year, we acquired the popular bitcoin wallet application MultiBit. That decision has led to many doors opening for us and new customers for our services. You can look at a chart of our sales and see the date we re-branded the software dramatically increasing our sales of KeepKey.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"The biggest consequence of bootstrapping has been the ever sense of resource deprivation. There always seems to be a feeling that we are one or two people short for a given task.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Being forced to choose an MVP, we would have to go with Bezos. He has an amazing track record of not losing sight of long-term visions while faced with the ever-changing short-term realities of business. Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Eating. A company that breaks bread together stays together. Our company's size lets us eat lunch together every day, and I think it is one of the reasons why we work so well together.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"We have a great culture here, and we are guided during hiring to maintain that. While skill is important, we spend enough time with candidates to get a good feel of how they work in our environment.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Expect some turbulence. Being an entrepreneur is not so much about having great ideas as it is about solving problems. In startups, Murphy's law is alive and well. A great entrepreneur is defined by their ability to maneuver around the unexpected.\" ",

A new SEC filing reveals that the Seattle-based startup just raised $3.4 million of a $6.1 million round. Utrip CEO Gilad Berenstein wouldn't comment on the new funding, but did tell GeekWire that Acorn Ventures, an early-stage venture fund out of Bellevue, Wash., is leading the round. Costco CFO Richard Galanti and hotelier Craig Schafer also participated. Utrip is still actively fundraising for the round. Berenstein also said that former Expedia CFO Michael Adler has joined the company's board of directors. \"Mike is as qualified and as knowledgeable as basically anyone else in the world when it comes to our industry and when it comes to understanding the financial levers that actually make our industry move and succeed,\" Berenstein said. Utrip will use fresh cash to make mobile a higher priority, continue developing the company's machine learning technology, expand to 800 destinations by the end of 2017, and bring on new employees, including the startup's first sales team. Utrip is also doubling down on its B2B offerings. In addition to providing travel recommendations to consumers, Utrip licenses its software to hotels, tourist attractions, and other travel companies. \"We're creating a suite of APIs that allows our B2B customers to be able to be much more targeted and personalized in the way that they interact with their customers,\" said Berenstein, winner of the Young Entrepreneur of the Year at the GeekWire Awards in 2015. Utrip currently serves 53 business clients who operate more than 300 hotels. The Holland America cruise line is one of Utrip's biggest customers and soon the startup will announce \"two of the five biggest hotel chains in the world\" as clients, according to Berenstein. On the consumer side, Utrip uses machine learning technology to help travelers build itineraries based on budgets, interests, and priorities. The 5-year-old startup's consumer business has seen more than 650 percent year-over-year growth in unique users over the past year, Berenstein said. Despite its strong and growing business, Utrip was still a little nervous when Alphabet rolled out its own travel planning app, \"Google Trips,\" in September. \"Any time that a giant like Google enters your space there's a little bit of fear, but ultimately for us, we see this as an exciting opportunity,\" Berenstein said. He later said that Utrip could potentially help Google down the road. \"Google has introduced recommendations from their Google Places database,\" Berenstein said. \"We think, in that area, there's a lot of room for them to grow and improve. We think that they could partner with Utrip to do that even better and faster.\" ",

      "content": "KITT.AI is rolling out its newest flagship product. Available today in beta, ChatFlow is a multi-platform framework for creating conversational agents, also known as chatbots. It provides a drag-and-drop interface that lets developers code and deploy chatbots that can exist directly within apps like Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Kik, Skype, Twilio, and Slack. \"ChatFlow's conversational engine solves many pain points of developing a natural language dialogue system: managing dialogue context, tracking dialogue states, planning/drawing a dialogue diagram, etc.,\" said KITT.AI co-founder and CEO Xuchen Yao. Chatbots, which have received much attention and hype over the past year, are designed to help people be more productive and improve efficient communication between businesses and customers. The technology sometimes provides a better interface than using a separate app or website. Here's a bit more on how ChatFlow works:  KITT.AI, originally incubated inside Paul Allen's Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), launched last year and in January landed funding from Founders' Co-op and Amazon's Alexa Fund. It also received investment from Madrona Venture Group. The startup currently consists of its three co-founders, but is looking to hire employees and raise additional funding soon. In May, KITT.AI rolled out its first software toolkit called Snowboy, which lets developers add verbal \"hotword detection\" to devices. The startup optimized Snowboy last month to allow third-party developers outside of Amazon to use the \"Alexa\" wake word to turn on their devices. KITT.AI previously developed a prototype called Semantic Lighting based on its technology -- letting people interact with smartlights by talking with them -- demonstrating the early capabilities of its natural language processing platform. Yao is a Johns Hopkins University PhD graduate who joined the AI2 in May 2015. The startup's other co-founders are Guoguo Chen, a deep learning and speech recognition expert who created the \"OK Google\" hotword detection prototype for Android; and Kenji Sagae former professor of Natural Language Processing at USC and an expert in natural language parsing and dialogue systems. \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Former Microsoft exec Anoop Gupta, Telo CEO and co-founder, with Aravind Bala, CTO and co-founder.  (GeekWire File Photo / Todd Bishop)\n Telo, a messaging startup led by former Microsoft executive and distinguished scientist Anoop Gupta, has raised $2.2 million in funding in its pursuit of a new communication service that empowers and delivers value to recipients of messages, rather than senders or social networks. The seed round was disclosed in an SEC filing this week and confirmed by Gupta, Telo's CEO, who said via email that the startup has brought on board \"some incredible investors\" from both the Bay Area and the Seattle region. The company isn't yet identifying those investors or talking in detail about its plans. However, in an earlier interview with GeekWire, Gupta and co-founder Aravind Bala, a former Microsoft partner engineering manager, talked about their goals through a series of \"what if\" questions: What if users had a public address that they could share confidently, where they could receive relevant messages in a system that enabled meaningful interactions and conversations, discouraged misuse and spam, and provided value to recipients? Here's how the company's website explains the concept. Telo lets you decide who you want to hear from and which topics you are interested in connecting about. You establish the guidelines for that communication without interference from Internet advertisers or recruiters seeking to leverage your network for their own means. If somebody wants to reach out to you outside of those guidelines, they pay for that communication just as they would an ad except, with Telo, the money comes to you - keep the money or send it to a charity of your choosing. On his LinkedIn page, Gupta writes that the company believes \"life-changing opportunities arise when we move beyond the familiar, exploring options beyond what is known to us, reaching out beyond our immediate network of co-workers and friends.\" The goal is to provide professionals \"with visibility, transparency and access to the landscape of opportunities available to them - and the means to find, reach and be reached by people who can help them seize those opportunities.\" Gupta left Microsoft in November after nearly 20 years, including two years as technical assistant to Bill Gates, and four years leading Microsoft's Unified Communications Group. He was an associate computer science professor at Stanford University from 1987 to 1997, also serving as co-founder and chief scientist at the startup VXtreme in Sunnyvale, Calif., based on early virtual classroom technologies developed at Stanford. Bala, a 15-year Microsoft veteran, spent time on products including Windows, Bing and AdCenter before working with Gupta on the Office Mix presentation service. Telo, based in Bellevue, Wash., was originally founded under the name ZipStorm. The company is currently accepting signups for its waitlist for the forthcoming Telo service. ",

      "content": "DocuSign founder Tom Gonser speaks at the 2015 GeekWire Summit.\n It's been a long journey for entrepreneur Tom Gonser, who founded electronic signature and paperwork startup DocuSign in Seattle 13 years ago. He has since served as the startup's CEO and then its chief strategy officer, and navigated DocuSign through explosive growth, hundreds of millions in funding, and a headquarters relocation to San Francisco. And now, Gonser is stepping away from the company to fill another essential role in the startup ecosystem: venture capitalist. Gonser has joined Bend, Ore., based venture capital firm Seven Peaks Ventures as a partner, and says he is excited to enter this new phase of his entrepreneurial career. \"I've actually always been investing in technology, its just been my own in the past several iterations,\" Gonser told GeekWire in an email. \"That aside, my FAVORITE part of starting something is the zero-1 step, where you create something that has not been done before, despite everyone telling you it can't be done,\" he said. \"That stage creates amazing things that kills some and makes others real founders. Short answer, I love the passion and grit it takes to start something new.\" In his new role at Seven Peaks Ventures -- a three-year-old firm started by venture capital veteran Dino Vendetti -- Gonser said he will be looking for gritty entrepreneurs who persistently chase what may seem like unrealistic dreams. That's something Gonser knows well, since he helped build DocuSign into a company with more than 250,000 paying customers, over 1,000 employees and a market value in the billions. \"I know what it takes to create a new category, and to build an industry,\" said Gonser. \"I hope to meet and work with founders who have this same ambition.  In building DocuSign, we made many many decisions on our growth. Some were great, some I wish I had back.  During the process, I learned how to build a true market-bending Unicorn.... I am eager to share this experience -- the good and the bad -- with our portfolio companies, so they can avoid some of those issues, and get there faster.\" Gonser said he's particularly interested in companies and entrepreneurs who are looking to digitize processes, removing \"old-style/fragile systems\" with flexible \"cloud based processes that can be nimble.\" \"There are a number of technologies including enterprise workflow and smart contracts, blockchain solutions, and mobile empowerment that will give leading edge companies a 10x advantage over those who move slowly,\" he said. \"If these new companies are smart they can execute a phased plan that gives them a position that is very hard to break.  This is where I'm interested in investing.\" Gonser did consider joining other venture capital firms, but he said Seven Peaks' geography and \"rise of the rest\" motto resonated with him. He said that \"the next great idea could come from your neighborhood, not just from the San Francisco Bay Area.\" For someone like Gonser, who has deep roots in the San Francisco and Seattle startup scenes, a somewhat out-of-the-way city like Bend may seem like a strange choice. But Gonser said cities like Bend are actually ideal for startups, and companies like Seven Peaks Ventures are heralding in a new set of options for startups. \"I think smart people will realize that the gains in baseline standard of living are so much higher just one hour away from major metro areas, that we will see a flock of really smart founders decide to build the next great company in a location that allows a better balance, and is actually much more efficient,\" he said. \"Seven Peaks Ventures shares a similar feeling that technology has moved to a point where you no longer have to move your company to a big city to succeed,\" said Gonser. He added that he anticipates hubs like Bend, only an hour's flight to the San Francisco Bay Area, will become increasingly popular locales for young startups. \"How awesome was it to find a high caliber team (led) by a seasoned VC from the Bay Area living in Bend, already creating the best venture capital opportunity for startups in the Pacific Northwest, where my roots are,\" Gonser said. Vendetti, a former partner at Bay Partners in Silicon Valley and Vulcan Ventures in Seattle, is certainly excited to have another experienced entrepreneur on the Seven Peaks' team. \"Tom shares our belief that category-leading companies are being built in thriving regional markets across the country and in particular in the West, where easy access to the Bay Area has made markets like Seattle, Portland and Salt Lake City very attractive to both entrepreneurs and investors,\" said Vendetti in a release. An early stage venture fund, Seven Peaks has backed a number of companies in the past three years, including Portland-based Opal Labs, Seattle-based Amplero and Bend-based Droplr. Watch Gonser speak about his experience as an entrepreneur at the 2015 GeekWire Summit below.  \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Moz Founder Rand Fishkin.\n Transparency is a core value for Rand Fishkin and Moz, the Seattle marketing software company he founded 12 years ago. While it has guided Moz along its startup journey, staying true to that value also caused some bumps in the road. Speaking on a panel Thursday in Seattle at an event hosted by Techstars and Silicon Valley Bank at Moz's downtown headquarters, Fishkin retold a story of how writing a public blog post about losing an investor turned into a positive outcome for his company. In early 2011, a New York investor first approached Fishkin with a $24 million offer to invest in Moz. Fishkin weighed different offers, but eventually agreed to the original deal with a term sheet, often considered a point of no return in fundraising because the startup has to break the news to other suitors. Two weeks later, Fishkin said the VC pulled out of the deal. \"The best part about this otherwise frustrating result is that we didn't end up signing a deal with a firm who didn't truly believe in us, our market or our future,\" Fishkin wrote in a 5,600-word blog post detailing the debacle. As GeekWire's John Cook noted at the time, the blog post was virtually unprecedented behavior in the fundraising world -- and it came with consequences. \"That blog post pissed off almost all of the other investors that we had talked to in that process, more so than expected,\" Fishkin said Thursday. The event, called \"Culture. Why it's Absolutely Good for Business,\" brought Fishkin, LiquidPlanner CEO Liz Pearce, and Swift HR Solutions Founder Shannon Swift together to discuss the importance of company values. Angel investor Heather Redman moderated. Both Pearce and Swift stressed the importance of leadership in defining company culture. \"It really does need to start at the top,\" said Swift. \"Trying to manage culture from the middle is pretty ineffective.\" When Fishkin published his blog post, he felt like was leading by example. He brought it up at the event Thursday to demonstrate the importance of upholding your company's values, even if it makes you unpopular. \"We are transparent even to a fault, so I did write about this experience,\" he said. But not every investor was turned off by that polarizing blog post. It resonated with Brad Feld, managing director of the Boulder, Colo. venture capital firm Foundry Group. \"For whatever reason, he became my friend the minute he read that,\" Fishkin said. \"He was like, 'this is a person with whom I am aligned. I like this company's values.'\" Feld flew Fishkin out to Boulder on a Friday; two days later, they set their terms. Feld joined the board and Foundry participated in an $18 million round in 2012. In January of this year, Foundry Group invested an additional $10 million in Moz, bringing the company's valuation to $120 million. \"He turned into a wonderful investor,\" said Fishkin. \"In the short term, values caused problems and challenges -- long term, it worked out.\" Editor's note: Moz is a GeekWire annual sponsor.

      "content": "Zymergen, a biological engineering startup based in the San Francisco area, is building out an engineering center in Seattle, GeekWire has learned. A Zymergen spokesperson confirmed that the company's Seattle office, located in the World Trade Center downtown,  opened Tuesday. Three employees are already based in the space, and the company is actively hiring engineers to build out the office. The company picked Seattle for the engineering office because it is a data science and software engineering hub, two areas that are core to Zymergen's business, the spokeswoman said. The office will initially be focused on engineering. It is the latest in a string of Silicon Valley companies which have set up engineering outposts in the Seattle area, mining the region's technology talent. Other companies now operating engineering centers in the Seattle area include Dropbox, Twitter, Salesforce, eBay, Facebook, and more than 75 other companies, according to a list compiled by GeekWire. Zymergen engineers a variety of chemicals and molecules that do not naturally occur, for use in industries from agriculture to electronics. The company uses microbes to custom design materials, much like the metamaterials being developed in Bellevue's Intellectual Science Fund at Intellectual Ventures. Zymergen leverages data science and software to manufacture these particles more effectively than traditional approaches, according to its website. \"Our comprehensive approach brings together technology, automation, and biology with the most sophisticated capabilities in each,\" the company's website says. \"As a result, we deliver better economics for current products, help customers bring new products to market faster, and develop novel products the world has not yet seen.\" Zymergen's expansion follows a $130 million Series B round in early October, reported by The New York Times. The round was led by Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank, and coincided with the addition of SoftBank exec Deep Nishar and former secretary of energy Steven Chu as Zymergen directors. The company is led by CEO Joshua Hoffman, a McKinsey & Company veteran who previously served as a partner at Norcob Capital. The CTO is Aaron Kimball, a University of Washington computer science grad who previously worked at Cloudera and WibiData. ",

      "content": "The Fleet Team.\n Like a true entrepreneur, Max Lock is always looking for the next big thing. He had his ear to the ground when he was building Schoolboy Ice Cream and saw the demand for environmentally conscious disposable dessert dishes and cutlery. In that venture, he saw how painful international shipping can be for small businesses. That's where he got the idea for Fleet Logistics. \"I thought, 'if we can book our air tickets and hotels online for our travel - we should be able to do the same for our freight,'\" he said. \"So the idea of Fleet was born -- an online platform where shippers of any size can find logistics service providers and manage the whole international shipping process.\" Fleet customers can get shipping quotes, pay online, send messages through the platform, and check on shipping status. The startup was the first runner-up at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2014 and in 2015 it raised a seed round and began growing its Portland team. Earlier this year, Fleet announced a $4 million investment round, bringing the total funding to date to $4.5 million. We caught up with Lock for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"An online marketplace for international logistics, connecting shippers and logistics service providers.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"I have always been entrepreneurial and started a series of businesses while in high school. These businesses have evolved from my interests as one opportunity has opened the door to other progressively bigger and more significant opportunities. While providing systems consulting services to a local restaurant, I seized the opportunity to start an organic ice cream company. The ice cream business led me to import paper and plastic products from Asia and develop a customer base amongst the rapidly growing frozen yogurt industry. My experience as an importer and distributor convinced me that the ocean shipping industry is ripe for disruption and the idea for Fleet was born.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"We went the VC route because we are trying to change a massive old school industry and needed the capital to build out our product and to reassure our service providers that we'd be around for many years to come.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Our secret sauce isn't so secret. In everything that we do, we put the customer first. I know this sounds cliche but we operate in an old-school industry that doesn't prioritize the customer experience and neglects many small to medium sized businesses. For example, one of the things we started was 'The Price You See is the Price You Pay' because traditional freight forwarders took advantage of smaller customers by quoting one price and charging another once the shipment has been delivered. This level of transparency helps us stand out from our competition.\"  The smartest move we've made so far: \"The smartest move we've made so far is moving to Portland, Oregon. There is a tremendous amount of pressure to start your company in the Bay Area because that is where capital is as well as a large talent pool. What people don't tell you about is the outrageous overhead and competitive recruiting scene. Moving to Portland allowed us to put more money towards building out our product and made it easy to recruit top talents.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"The biggest mistake that we've made so far is keeping employees who aren't a good cultural fit for extended periods of time. It is natural for startups to think that having someone is better than having nobody, but that often isn't the case. We've found that having open and honest communication about what is and isn't working is better than avoiding the problem or fearing the decrease in productivity.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Right now I'd prefer to have Bezos in our corner. Amazon is currently working on building out their own logistics network from the ground up for everything from last mile delivery to ocean freight and air freight. It is yet to be seen what kind of impact this will have on the industry, but I'd rather have them in our corner than competing against them.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Our favorite team-building activities are escape rooms and potlucks. We are a bunch of foodies who love to solve puzzles.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"The biggest thing that we look for when hiring is people who do well with ambiguity. Fleet is a smallish team that works in a very fast-paced startup environment where tasks and projects frequently change. We look for people who are able to take an idea, run with it and adapt to the changing needs of our customers and service providers.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Always go an extra mile to service your customers.\" ",

      "content": "Brady Forrest of Highway1 at the 2015 GeekWire Summit.\n San Francisco-based hardware startup accelerator Highway1, part of custom hardware company PCH, announced today that Brady Forrest will be leaving his position there. Forrest has led Highway1 since co-founding it in 2013. Forrest is a well-known figure in the Seattle technology scene, where he originally founded the popular Ignite event series with Bre Pettis, who went on to co-found 3D printer company MakerBot Industries. \"It's time to do something new,\" Forrest told GeekWire this morning. \"I've decided to leave, though it will be hard.\" Kurt Dammermann, the co-founder of PHC's design engineering division, will lead Highway1 after Forrest's departure. Forrest said he will finish advising the current cohort of startups and assist in selecting the next cohort before officially stepping back in January, although he will remain as a special advisor to Highway1 even after that point. \"I've been doing this for a long time, and it's been totally amazing,\" Forrest said. \"We've had a lot of great people come through Highway1 as my team, and 74 companies go through. And those are all people that are going to stay in my life far beyond my tenure at Highway1.\" Forrest has yet to decide what he'll do next. But in addition to a new full-time gig, he said he will spend more time focusing on personal projects, including Ignite, the popular event series that Forrest co-founded in Seattle in 2006. Ignite, which features five-minute talks with auto-advancing slides, has since expanded to other cities in the US and around the world, and is celebrating its 10th anniversary later this month. Forrest acquired Ignite from O'Reilly Media last year. He said he has been working on several new projects for Ignite, including Global Ignite Week, which will kick off next May. \"I'll have time to focus on those things and get those things moving,\" he said. He also said he will be staying in the Bay Area for the foreseeable future, although he still has strong roots in Seattle and spends a good amount of time there. \"The dream is to come back to Seattle at some point in time, I just don't know when,\" he said. Forrest has seen first-hand what makes hardware startups succeed, so we asked him for some words of wisdom as he prepares to step back. His biggest takeaways? \"One, hardware requires a much bigger team. Two, those teams take too long to get their product in the hands of customers,\" he said. \"When your customers don't want to give the beta back, when they want to keep the product, that can become strong enough to get investor traction.\" ",

      "content": "Via Atlas.\n Microsoft and Nathan Myhrvold are some of the backers behind a new Seattle startup that wants to create a search engine for your digital life. Atlas Informatics today pulled back the curtain on its technology and fundraising to date, announcing that Microsoft, Myhrvold -- the Intellectual Ventures co-founder and former Microsoft CTO -- and Aspect Ventures are among the investors who have put a collective $20.7 million behind the company. Atlas came out of stealth mode a year ago as the first company spun out of Seattle startup innovation studio Ivy Softworks, revealing a few details about its technology. Now the company is releasing its first product, called Atlas Recall, in open beta for Mac users, with support for Windows 10 coming. There's also an iOS companion app that launched today. Jordan Ritter, the Napster co-founder who launched Ivy Softworks and is CEO of Atlas, describes the company's product as a \"searchable photographic memory for our entire digital life.\" The software runs in the background of your computer, using the accessibility features in the operating system to capture an index of semi-structured text. It keeps a encrypted record of everything you are doing across different apps and services, whether it's email, a web page, a word document, a PowerPoint, a Slack message, etc. There are already existing services that comb your digital footprint, but they utilize the APIs for each app or program. Ritter said Atlas is \"profoundly\" different. \"We take a fundamentally different approach -- one that no one has ever done before,\" he said. \"We drop down a layer into the OS.\" Atlas also integrates with Google search and Spotlight on Mac and lets you use those platforms to search across your digital footprint.  For example, imagine this scenario. You're an employer getting ready to interview an engineer. There have been emails exchanged, notes taken, calendar items listed. You want to access that person's resume, but can't remember his or her name. Atlas lets you search for \"security engineer,\" which surfaces the person's face from a LinkedIn page you were previously looking at. You recognize the person, see the LinkedIn page, and can then easily access the resume and other related documents because you were looking at all of that around the same time.  One of the company's taglines is, \"if you've seen it, you can search for it.\" Travis Murdock, VP of marketing for Atlas, said that \"what we're really building is search that works like your memory.\" \"Very often when you remember things, you remember where you were, or who you were with, or who you sent something to,\" Murdock explained. \"That type of contextual search is very unique to what we're doing, and it happens because we are remembering these documents at the time when you have them open.\" Ritter called the accompanying smartphone app a \"killer use case.\" \"You're about to walk into a meeting and you need to send your colleague a Word document, a Google Doc, and some emails,\" he said, offering a hypothetical example. \"How are you going to get all that stuff? Which system were you using? Where? When? You don't remember, but you can load up Recall on your phone, do a quick search, and all your stuff is there. You can click to share and walk away. Ritter added that the indexing technology is \"on the level of sophistication for what it takes to build an anti-virus system.\" Privacy, of course, will certainly be a concern for customers with Atlas, given the access to so much personal and private information. Atlas has a \"privacy promise\" to all users, guaranteeing that they remain in control and own their data at all times. It uses features like \"Pause\" to give users a way to block Atlas from remembering what you're doing for a given time period, or \"Block,\" which lets you block specific URLs or files or apps that you don't want Atlas recording. \"All of the digital items remain encrypted both at rest and at motion,\" Murdock added. \"That means your data is always secure no matter what happens to it.\" The company has some big-name investors like Myrhvold and Microsoft, which is not investing via its Microsoft Ventures arm but from the company itself, Ritter said. \"I think they see a huge opportunity with an unmet need for the digital chaos problem,\" he said of the investors. There are plans to go beyond what Atlas Recall currently offers. Ritter said the next phase will be about \"intelligent suggestion,\" with devices and software learning more about users and helping them achieve even more productivity-oriented tasks. \"That is a huge future and there are so many things you can do around that,\" Ritter said. \"I think that's why everybody is really excited.\" When Atlas first spun out of Ivy Softworks, all of the employees from Ivy Softworks shifted to work for Atlas. For now, Ivy Softworks \"has been put on pause for now, but the business continues to exist,\" Ritter said. There are 34 employees at Atlas. As Ritter explained to GeekWire in 2014, in his view, it's simply inefficient to spend time recruiting a whole new set of A-team players or finding new office space every time a new business idea emerges. His goal is to \"keep the band together,\" even after a group of innovators spends a few years building one product. \"You spent all of this time and energy and effort and money into cohering this amazing group of people ... but you end up with this core group and kernel of innovators only to lose them in the third year,\" he said last year. \"A good idea with a bad team fails 100 percent of the time.

      "content": "A cooler of Burger patties from Crowd Cow arrived on dry ice. (Kurt Schlosser / GeekWire)\n More than a year after launching Crowd Cow, the startup with a mission of delivering quality beef to meat eaters through crowdfunding, founders Joe Heitzeberg and Ethan Lowry report that more and more cows are \"tipping\" and the business is growing rapidly. The two veterans of the Seattle tech scene showed off their new business back in February, and explained how they were going to take the mystery out of meat by connecting people online to sustainably raised and processed beef in the Northwest. Since then, they've sold well over 100 cows and have opened up delivery to the entire West Coast. Just a few weeks after soft-launching shipping to California, 38 percent of orders were coming from that state -- an amazing feat considering it took nine months to reach that volume in Washington. \"Our grand ambitious plan for the next year is opening up for growth on the West Coast and then to the rest of the country,\" Heitzeberg said. \"We've got our own facility, we've got our own freezers in there, we've got the whole software platform we've created to help us actually scale up and we're prepared for more scale than we're doing now even. So we've got a whole process/quality control/supply chain in place so that we could actually grow quite a bit right now without really even having a hiccup with it.\" Heitzeberg said in order to go national, Crowd Cow will have to replicate what it's doing on the sourcing and fulfillment side out West in at least one other geography that would allow them to handle the East Coast. \"Part of what we're going through now is being two founders with a virtual office and no facilities to having a facility and having the machinery in place to grow,\" Heitzeberg said. \"Now we're shifting the weight and it's going to be all about growth and not so much about proving out the business -- we think we have a business, it's time to build the team a little bit and all that stuff.\" Beyond seeing their deliveries reach further destinations, the growth of the business is becoming evident in other ways. \"Joe and I are no longer the people actually packing beef, so that's been a nice perk,\" Lowry joked.  Next time you see a UPS truck, it just might be filled with #crowdcow A photo posted by Crowd Cow (@crowdcow) on Jun 28, 2016 at 5:29pm PDT   Next time you see a 1984 Mercedes Sedan rolling down the highway, it might just be full of #crowdcow A photo posted by Crowd Cow (@crowdcow) on Jun 28, 2016 at 6:08pm PDT  Spreading the word has been part of the growth process as well. Heitzeberg said crowd funding a cow is a \"funny story\" and has caught the attention of media as far away as the Czech Republic, for instance. But until recently, they had to take the story to their own backyard, in Portland, by getting on the phone and calling people they knew. Word is out among ranchers, too, as beef suppliers get more familiar with what Crowd Cow is looking for and eventually providing by working with top-notch producers and artisanal butchers. \"What's funny on the ranch front is we're starting to get ranchers, they contact us pretty regularly now and say, 'Hey, I would like to have my beef on Crowd Cow,'\" Lowry said. \"In the first six months, we would call them and nine out of 10 ranchers would say, 'Huh? Who are you? What? You want to a buy a cow? We don't sell cows, we sell steers.' And then we gradually figured out the lingo and now ranches are aware of us and the ranches we work with like us so they say nice things about us to their friends. So the supply side thing is getting easier in a lot of ways as word gets out about what we're doing.\"  #Repost @cameraotoko  My #crowdcow arrived!  Harry is excited. A photo posted by Crowd Cow (@crowdcow) on Jul 28, 2016 at 3:35pm PDT  Crowd Cow says that its technology is playing a key role in opening up the market because it allows the company to accurately partition and sell every cut from the animal so nothing is wasted. Customers can pick and choose the exact cuts and quantities they want -- however much or little -- and this contrasts with traditional cow sharing from local farms, where it's typically necessary to buy hundreds of pounds of beef in one big miscellaneous mix. Technology also helps gets the product shipped efficiently to nine states (Washington, California, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and parts of Nevada, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado). Algorithms are used to compute the perishable weight and pull weather forecast information on the fly to determine the optimal quantity of ice, select the appropriate packaging and pick the best carrier. The company is still bootstrapped, which they joke equates to \"paid for by spouses.\" But Heitzeberg, who led the in-house startup incubator for Madrona Venture Group, and Lowry, who was one of the co-creators of the restaurant directory service Urbanspoon, are well aware of when it will become necessary to seek additional funding. \"We've had companies before and had some success so it's easier for us to bootstrap and hold out longer,\" Heitzeberg said. \"But I think at a certain point it makes sense, when you a reach a point where the opportunity is so big and you've proven how to mechanically go after it then it absolutely makes sense for everybody to put more money into it.\" On a recent Sunday, I had the chance to throw several Crowd Cow burger patties on the grill during halftime of a Seahawks game. I'm not sure if it speaks more to lousy football that day or the anticipation of great food, but those in attendance very much looked forward to the halftime meal. The patties, from Step by Step Farm in Curtis, Wash., did not disappoint. The burgers were lean and flavorful. We all loved that the chargrilled taste of the meat was so pronounced even with the addition of cheese and condiments, etc. The burgers also did not shrink on the grill and maintained their size. Knowing the backstory of the beef undoubtedly plays into your mind and sends a signal to your tastebuds. I don't eat a ton of red meat, but when you've made an effort to understand how something is raised and processed, it goes a long way. \"Once you know where your food is coming from and you've tasted how good it can be -- you are what you eat, and the same goes for the beef, right?\" Heitzeberg said. \"When it's eating good and it's been cared for it tastes better. It's all dry aged on Crowd Cow, which you never find at the store, hardly.\" It's the reason Crowd Cow is seeing a lot of customers coming back for more. They've had some folks who have ordered 10 times, 12 times or more. Beef is still the focus, but they understand variety could also be a component to future growth. \"People are eating a lot of beef, and of course they want pork and even seafood,\" Heitzeberg said. \"It's a small startup and we had to pick our focuses, and our next focus is opening up and getting that growth thing going, build the team a little bit and then we'll layer in those other things over time, hopefully quickly.\" ",

      "content": "Image via Porch\n In its early days, Porch was a small, scrappy startup, doing a lot with a little. The Seattle home improvement data company used folding tables and leftover chairs and encouraged employees to bring their own laptops. Then came the investment dollars. Founded in 2012, Porch at one point grew to nearly 500 employees after raising $100 million in a little more than two years. Following a $65 million round in January 2015, its valuation reached $500 million. But then, almost exactly a year ago, the company slashed 90 jobs and saw key executives depart as part of a broad reshuffling and strategy shift. After the layoffs, Porch employed about 400 people. Today the employee count is at 250 -- down from 300 this past August -- and the company has continued to tighten the screws of its business over the past year, focusing more on profitability rather than just pure growth. Earlier this month, Porch cut four more positions, CEO Matt Ehrlichman confirmed to GeekWire. Three people from its enterprise sales/account management team were let go, and another from a project management role. Given that there are 250 employees, four layoffs is not a significant cut. But it does mark a continued shift for Porch, which connects customers with home improvement professionals. Ehrlichman explained that Porch made a big shift last year \"from scaling with people to scaling with product.\" It's made a big impact on profitability, he said. \"Like a lot of our peers, a year ago we moved from a focus on pure revenue growth, to a more sustainable focus on profitability,\" Ehrlichman said. \"As part of that, we continually evaluate which roles are critical and are staying lean and hungry as we drive the business toward profitability.\" The most recent cuts affected three people working on Enterprise Direct Connect, a new product that debuted in August which allows larger companies to integrate Porch's platform into their CRM systems, making it easier to surface requests from homeowners. A Porch spokesperson said that the product line is doing well, with revenue growth rate up 50 percent month-over-month, but that the three roles were eliminated \"because of advancements we made in the tech platform and efficiency.\" Porch is still hiring, with most of its open roles in engineering, product, design, and analytics. Ehrlichman said that Porch is focusing on a \"capital light\" model to help increase sales productivity. \"As we've transformed the company over 2016, we made an active choice to not backfill most attrition, particularly in sales and support,\" he said. Porch also no longer offers a consumer mobile app, which it first released in December 2014. The app helped homeowners connect quickly with Porch representatives and independent home improvement professionals to get guidance on projects and arrange to have work done on their homes. The Porch spokesperson said the company is still investing in its app for professionals. The company, which counts investors like Lowe's and Founders Fund, has also consolidated its headquarters to just one floor after inking a lease for two floors at the Cobalt Building in Seattle's Sodo neighborhood last year.  Like a lot of our peers, a year ago we moved from a focus on pure revenue growth, to a more sustainable focus on profitability.Porch, which makes money by charging home-improvement pros for market insights, promotional exposure and other services, announced this month that it is integrating with Facebook for a new feature that lets customers easily connect with home professionals on the social media platform. The company also recently inked a partnership with Portland-based lighting and home goods retailer Rejuvenation, adding to its existing deals with Lowe's, Wayfair, ATGStores.com and others. Porch told GeekWire in August it is \"actively engaged\" with approximately 141,000 professionals, while there is a directory of more than three million professionals on the site. Project request volume spiked nearly 100 percent from January to June of this year, mainly because the startup cut its unit acquisition expense in half. Update, Oct. 31, 4:10 p.m.: After this story published, a Porch spokesperson said Monday that in addition to the four layoffs previously noted, another nine employees from the \"Customer Service Manager\" team were let go this past Friday. \"The CSM team has not been accountable for our performance or effort and I'm responsible for that,\" Porch co-founder Ronnie Castro wrote in an all-company email. \"I decided to make changes to refocus our team on professional growth and to be accountable to each other. This is a major change in the team -- we need to make stronger commitments and hold people accountable to goals and commitments. This isn't something we've done well and I believe it's necessary for us to hit the goals we have in front of us.\" ",

      "content": "Venture Kits teaches kids about entrepreneurship through play.\n Most young children don't say \"CEO,\" when asked what they want to be when they grow up. Leslie Feinzaig wants to change that. To get kids excited about entrepreneurship, she launched Venture Kits, a Seattle startup that makes educational toys for kids. Feinzaig began selling the first product, a bakery kit, in limited release this month. \"I founded Venture Kits on a mission to democratize entrepreneurship,\" she said. \"I believe all kids should experience entrepreneurship so that all kids have a more equal chance to become tomorrow's leaders. The mission is not just about creating an army of future founders. It is about teaching our children vital skills and promoting diversity in business leadership.\" The idea for Venture Kits came to Feinzaig when she became a parent. As a Harvard MBA who's held leadership roles at Julep, Big Fish, and Microsoft, she wanted to inspire ambition in her daughter. \"As an entrepreneur and a parent, I realized that the skills I use on the job are the same ones that I want my daughter to develop, like grit, initiative, problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity,\" she said. \"I want my daughter to be comfortable with failure, and I want her to face her fears. Nothing teaches you these lessons like entrepreneurship does.\" Feinzaig also wants the toys to promote a spirit of leadership among groups underrepresented in the business world. \"I want more kids of all backgrounds to visualize themselves as a CEO and to know that they are capable of becoming one,\" she said. We caught up with Feinzaig for this installment of Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire Feature. Continue reading for her answers to our questionnaire. Explain what you do so our parents can understand: \"Venture Kits turn kids into CEOs and entrepreneurs through hands-on play.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"In January, I had a baby girl. My husband, a software engineer, immediately stocked up on GoldieBlox and Robot Turtles. I'm the MBA in the family. One day I looked at my baby and imagined her opening a letter that said 'Congratulations! You are now the CEO.' Venture Kits was born, fully formed, right then and there. I decided that I would write that exact letter to my daughter - and to all kids - and I'd put it in inside an entrepreneurial activity kit.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"I put some of my savings into Venture Kits, and there's revenue coming in from our first prototype. So for now, we have a little runway.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"This might not be the sexiest answer but ... we really, really care about our mission.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Getting kids involved in product development. It started with kids from my neighborhood coming over to play with early prototypes. Eventually, that turned into our Board of Kid Advisors, which already has around 100 kids from across the country. (You can find the application to join this Board on our website).\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"I don't think I've made one huge mistake ... I've made lots and lots of little ones.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Sheryl Sandberg. Hey Sheryl - if you're reading this, you're my role model! I want to send you a couple of kits for your kids to try. Email me.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Assembling Venture Kits in my basement. Nothing binds people together like complaining about repetitive stress injuries. (Disclaimer: Nobody other than me has actually gotten hurt assembling Venture Kits. Hear that, OSHA?).\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Kindness.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"I'd relay a piece of advice I got from Liz Pearce last year. I was working on a different idea back then and she told me to make sure that 'the river runs deep.' I stopped working on that venture soon after. Starting a company is a huge trough of hard, unglamorous work. Make sure your river runs deep so you can make it through times of drought.\" ",

      "content": "  Four Microsoft veterans have teamed up to create Optio3, a Seattle-based startup aimed at building a web-based service that helps manage commercial facilities like hotels, offices, universities and malls, with a focus on controlling the myriad internet-connected devices within those facilities. The startup just reeled in $2 million in angel funding from unnamed sources in the Bay Area, Boston, Chicago and Seattle. It plans to use the funds to boost a private beta program in Washington and California for hotel groups, universities and large office complexes that are looking at ways to reduce operations costs. \"Labor represents over half of (such buildings') operational costs, and two-thirds of that is devoted to manual, inefficient or reactive tasks,\" co-founder Luis Salazar wrote in an email to GeekWire. \"Our software enables them to reduce their maintenance cost, run a smoother operation, optimize energy management and manage the lifecycle of all IoT assets from different manufacturers ... from any PC, tablet or mobile device.\" The service is intended for use by maintenance technicians, facilities managers and the operations and finance departments of such facilities because \"they suffer the unintended consequences of the explosion in the number of devices and the fragmentation among vendors,\" said Salazar. The U.S. alone has more than 5.6 commercial buildings, which are collectively expected to contain more than four billion internet-connected light switches, light bulbs, thermostats, motion sensors, smoke detectors and HVAC systems by 2020, according to Optio3's website. Inefficiency in managing those devices accounts for more than 30 percent of their operational cost. Salazar and his fellow co-founders -- CEO Sridar Chandrashekar, head of product management Mohan Thimmappa, and business-development head Jake Varghese -- all helped Microsoft launch Office Live (now called Office 365) and have a considerable history of working together. Salazar has held executive positions at Microsoft, Yahoo, Xerox and ABB. He co-founded Jobaline, an online service for hiring hourly workers. Chandrashekar most recently served as VP of IT operations management at cloud-computing company ServiceNow, where he filed 12 patents. Before that he worked at Microsoft for 18 years, most recently as senior director of engineering, focused on cloud infrastructure for Office 365. Thimmappa worked alongside Chandrashekar at ServiceNow, where he was senior director of customer success, and before that headed cloud infrastructure there. Prior to ServiceNow, he worked at Microsoft for five years as a program manager for Office 365's cloud infrastructure, again alongside Chandrashekar. Varghese worked with Chandrashekar and Thimmappa at ServiceNow, as senior director of engineering for IT operations management. Before that, he worked as a group product manager and an engineering manager at Microsoft for 13 years. Optio3 has two staffers in Santa Clara, Calif., and five in Seattle, with several openings. Optio3 says it complements Optimum Energy, a Seattle company that specializes in cutting energy consumption in commercial buildings. \"They are focused on energy savings, and we are laser-focused on maintenance management, asset management and operational management,\" Salazar said in his email.

      "content": "Bob Kelly is joining venture capital firm Ignition after a long Microsoft career\n Imagine a millennial -- raised with always-on fast internet, smartphones and the cloud -- reporting to work, sitting down at a desktop computer and staring at an SAP application. \"It's just a nonstarter,\" said Bob Kelly, a 21-year Microsoft veteran who today announced that he's signed on as a managing partner of prominent Seattle area venture capital firm Ignition Partners. Hard-core business software with roots in the client-server era will be revamped as \"everything is rethought on the business-process side,\" said Kelly, who spoke with GeekWire this week about his new role at Ignition and changes in the tech industry. \"Absolutely, enterprise business applications -- that's where the action is going to be for the next 10 years,\" he said. \"It will be completely transformative for venture capital, startups and enterprise customers.\" As much as he loves Microsoft, Kelly decided he wants to be part of that action. In January, he will join three other partners guiding strategy and fund investments at Bellevue, Wash.-based Ignition, which specializes in underwriting early-stage business-software startups. \"I've been very blessed to grow two businesses from nothing at Microsoft,\" Kelly said. \"If I'd wanted to stay at a large company and do large software, I would never have left there. But I felt at this point in my career, if I ever wanted to do something different, now was the appropriate time. The VC world is so passionate, filled with people who want to change the world, and I want to be around that. It's exciting and exhilarating for me.\" Kelly, now 50, started at Microsoft 21 years ago, an English literature Ph.D. candidate fresh from defending his thesis and put to work on a two-day, $20 contract interviewing beta users of a new product. \"I didn't want to do it, but my wife insisted,\" he recalled. \"Two days turned into a week turned into two weeks, and before long I was editing content for enterprise software. I was so hungry to learn that after a year of contracting, they hired me as a product manager in the Windows NT business. I call it my accidental career.\" He ended up helping to build and then running first Microsoft's Windows Server business and next its Azure cloud service. Kelly left Microsoft in September, where he most recently held the position of corporate VP for the Cloud + Enterprise Business development and strategy team, leading merger-and-acquisition strategy. Ignition appealed to him because \"I love the way they way they look at the world, their internal operations, their thesis.\" That thesis, he said, is that the future lies in understanding how millennials will transition \"from being on their phones to being in the workplace.\" To date, the rise of cloud computing, led by Amazon Web Services and Azure, has seen the most investment in infrastructure and DevOps, he said. Now, because of the movement of millennials into the work force, \"with their mobile-first, cloud-first world, all business processes are being rethought. Ignition has its fingers on the pulse of those trends and therefore on what bets to make.\" As the cloud grows to embrace and automate more and more of the computing world, \"what you're looking at is not an $80 to 100-billion enterprise software category but the cloud competing in a $1.2-trillion IT category, including hardware, professional services and every part of enterprise IT,\" he said. As to which cloud provider might prevail -- market-leading AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, which \"is getting serious about the enterprise side\" -- it's too early to predict, he said. Between September and January, Kelly has been spending his time consulting with start-ups and larger companies wanting to learn more about Microsoft, though he plans to take a long trip before taking up his new duties. A native of central Massachusetts, he now lives in Seattle with his wife and four children, ages 13 through 23. \"Bob has all the attributes we were looking for in a partner, including deep experience and scar tissue in enterprise and cloud computing, a vast knowledge base from working with tech startups over decades, customer and vendor perspectives on where enterprise computing is heading over the next five to ten years, and a person I have known for decades who is also just a high-quality human being,\" said Ignition Managing Partner John Connors in a statement. \"We couldn't be more pleased to bring someone of Bob's caliber and experience on board.\" Kelly is active in the startup community as both an investor and a mentor, in both Seattle and San Francisco. He serves on the board of advisors at 9Mile Labs, a Seattle-based accelerator. Oh, and he finally did get that Ph.D. He holds a master's degree and doctorate in English literature from the University of Dallas, and a bachelor of arts in Liberal Arts and Sciences from Thomas More College of Liberal Arts. Ignition, which also has offices in Los Altos, Calif., currently has investments in more than 40 companies, including Apptio, Avvo, Chef, Cloudera, Docker, DocuSign, Moz, Skytap, and Xamarin. It recently invested in StrongLoop, which was bought by IBM last year, and in Wit.ai, which was bought by Facebook. ",

The Simply Measured co-founder, who spent nearly seven years in executive roles at the social media analytics company, is now working for Siftrock, a Seattle B2B marketing automation startup. Schoenfeld left Simply Measured earlier this year, but was mum about his next opportunity. Now we know: He's a co-founder at Siftrock along with Chris Hundley, former CTO at Optify and entrepreneur-in-residence at Madrona Venture Group who originally incorporated the company in 2014. Siftrock is a plug-in that helps marketers surface new leads and opportunities by automatically analyzing email responses from potential customers. Schoenfeld, who is CEO, calls it the \"simplest solution for Account-Based Marketing (ABM) data.\" For example, when a lead sends an \"out of office\" auto-reply referring a colleague, Siftrock mines the new contact data and syncs to your marketing platform. Or when a prospect replies with a buying question, Siftrock finds the opportunity and the right person to handle the request. \"ABM is the biggest trend in B2B marketing,\" Schoenfeld told GeekWire. \"Most B2B marketers know their target companies, but struggle to identify enough contacts inside their target accounts and lack context about those accounts. Siftrock turns replies into a new data source to help solved this problem.\" For Siftrock, which is bootstrapped and already has customers like Citrix, Nutanix, Avalara, Payscale, NGINX, Glassdoor, and others, the vision goes beyond just email replies. \"Replies are an important beginning for us, but we see a big opportunity to build simple data and automation solutions that make systems run smoother and fuel better results for B2B marketers,\" Schoenfeld said. Schoenfeld, who was CEO at Simply Measured from 2010 to 2015, said he was drawn to Siftrock because of his background in marketing technology, but also because of Hundley. \"He's a talented technologist, amazing entrepreneur, and just a really good person,\" Schoenfeld said. \"He really impressed me and I saw great alignment between us as co-founders.\" Former Simply Measured account executive Katie Ferris is also now working at Siftrock, which announced general availability of its platform today. Simply Measured, meanwhile, this week announced a new CEO. The company is ranked No. 24 on the GeekWire 200. ",

      "content": "The Wicket Labs scorecard.\n Media and entertainment companies today are using more and more application program interfaces -- APIs -- to deliver their video products online and on mobile devices. But as reliance on cloud-based vendors for APIs increases, so does the potential for technical difficulties that ultimately frustrate consumers trying to consume content. That's where Wicket Labs wants to help. One year after leaving his post as co-CEO of ThePlatform, Marty Roberts has teamed up with other technology veterans to launch a new Seattle-based startup. Wicket Labs acts as a middleman between premium video production companies and the multiple third-party API vendors they use to deliver their content to a viewer. Unlike many existing startups, like fellow Seattle startup APIMetrics, Wicket Labs' tool is not built for developers and engineers who create APIs, but rather the content companies who need to keep track of them. Roberts told GeekWire that the 50 largest media companies across the U.S. and U.K use 14 different third-party APIs, on average, for tasks ranging from managing advertising content to processing payments. They are also updating these APIs on a daily basis -- even multiple times a day, in some cases. Roberts said the idea for Wicket Labs initially came about when he was working in leadership roles at Comcast-owned ThePlatform, an online video management service. He noticed many media companies calling about a consumer-reported problem with a website or app related to a \"mission critical\" API. But there was often little or no information about the cause or root of the issue, which varied depending on the company. \"Why were these big companies letting consumers report the problem?\" Roberts wondered. \"Why was it taking so long to figure out? Why weren't there more details about it?\" Following his departure from ThePlatform, Roberts teamed up with Eric Knutson, a former Rhapsody and RealNetworks executive, and Larry Hitchon, a veteran software engineer, to help build Wicket Labs. The new startup offers customers an automated dashboard that surfaces a detailed real-time status of each API in an easy-to-digest format. The idea is to help customers quickly identify problems; facilitate better conversations for faster resolutions; and provide a sandbox for user acceptance testing. \"It gives a customer an understanding of what's working and what's not across their client experience, based on the vendors they rely on,\" Roberts explained. Wicket Labs has spent the past few months working with a small group of trial customers -- big broadcast networks, cable networks, online video providers, etc. The company is bootstrapped and employs six people.

      "content": "Belle Pan, a 13-year-old student at Lakeside School in Seattle. Pan will pitch iRummage, at the SVP Fast Pitch Finals on October 25. Photo: Social Venture Partners.\n For most 11-year-olds, their experience with entrepreneurship ends at the summertime lemonade stand. But for Belle Pan, refreshing drinks and homemade cookies weren't cutting it. As the daughter of an entrepreneur, Pan could see that kids her age weren't getting experience with real-world business situations, things that would help them build skills and get excited about entrepreneurship. \"It would be nice if kids could get exposure to these thing before they go to college,\" she thought to herself at the time, when she was a sixth-grade student at Lakeside School in North Seattle. At the same time, Lakeside was considering scaling back their annual fundraising rummage sale because its logistics were becoming too difficult to manage. Bingo. Pan saw that these two problems could solve each other, with a little outside help. \"What if we did an OfferUp but for schools, where the items were donated so the money went to the school instead of the person selling the item,\" said Pan, referring to the popular Bellevue-based marketplace for selling goods. This platform would give schools the tech infrastructure to run their own rummage sales, and the sales themselves would be managed by students, giving them experience in business. Just like that, iRummage was born -- a school fundraising platform and business education tool, which has grown and evolved over the past two years. Now 13 years old and in eighth grade, Pan will be one of 14 innovators pitching their ideas at the Social Venture Partners' annual Fast Pitch finals on Tuesday, October 25. The Fast Pitch program is exclusively for innovations that address social needs, and consists of a series of pitch clinics that coach entrepreneurs on how to share their ideas.To get to the finals, innovators have made it through a series of prior contests, and have been coached by SVP staff. Not that these activities have kept Pan from her normal schedule -- in addition to being a full-time student and part-time CEO, Pan also plays the violin, sings in a school choir, and is training to be a coxswain on her rowing team. Check out her plans after winning the Fast Pitch semi-finals below:  The winners of Tuesday's final  are awarded a cash prize to continue developing their projects. And Pan has big plans for iRummage. \"One of the goals that we have is to train 100,000 10-year old CEOs,\" Pan said. She also said the program could potentially raise $100 million for schools in Washington state alone. But iRummage and its potential impact would never have happened if it weren't for a chance encounter two years ago, when Pan tagged along with her father at a Startup Weekend event. Sitting at the back of the crowd working on homework, Pan noticed another student around her age making a pitch. She realized that her great idea didn't have to be just an idea: she could pitch it here, and maybe even make it a real program. After some coaching and convincing from her father, IoT entrepreneur JT Pan, she pitched the idea, got together a team, and started work on a prototype.  One of the goals that we have is to train 100,000 10-year old CEOs. \"I built the app mockup, and for the sake of the presentation we 'hacked' OfferUp's website,\" Pan said, to show judges the intended UX. Two days later, Pan and her team won third place at the event. They even won a spot at 9MileLabs, which they had to turn down as two of their members were still completing middle school. Since then, Pan has been assisted in the project by fellow students, a 9MileLabs co-founder, a professor at Carnegie Mellon, and a myriad of entrepreneurs from the Seattle community. This summer, the iRummage team finished the app's UX design, and Pan said winning the Fast Pitch would help carry them into the next phase: active development. Here, the team will work out how to make the program best work for schools. \"It's meant to be as painless as possible for the school,\" Pan said. \"The general idea is that the school campaigns are run by the kids, and we structure the kids in a company format. So we have a school CEO, a school CTO, and a school CFO,\" she said. These positions will be filled by older students, generally grades 5 and up. There are also \"iRummage ambassadors\" that take on community outreach, gather donated items, help with the retail aspects of the sale. These students can be as young as first grade. For now, all the money raised will go directly to the schools, although iRummage may need to take a small percentage in the future to cover growing operating costs. And although the project is still in the early stages, Pan is thinking of the potential impact and, of course, the project's scalability. \"The key idea is that both the iRummage HQ and each school chapter, or school iRummage practice, will be decentralized and be able to run by themselves,\" JT Pan said, so as the program scales the team won't need to grow dramatically. For Belle Pan, that means she may be able to stay as CEO as the program grows. If it does become too much to manage while she is in school full-time, she said she would need to find someone who cares as deeply as she does about the project to take over. But for now, Pan is right where she wants to be -- at the helm of a startup, experiencing all the stresses and excitement that entrepreneurship brings. \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Ford Davidson\n Seattle entrepreneur Ford Davidson has been around the startup block a few times, selling his phone backup service Dashwire to HTC in 2011 and then raising cash for enterprise software startup Coolr in 2014. But Davidson -- who started his career as a product manager on the Windows Mobile team at Microsoft and shut down Coolr earlier this year -- is taking his entrepreneurial talents in a much different direction for his next gig. He's landed a role as principal product manager on Amazon's fast-growing Alexa team, certainly a change of course for a guy who is accustomed to working on small startup teams. I asked Davidson why he wanted to leave the startup life behind, and he offered a few explanations. \"I think the opportunity with hands-free, far-field voice services offer the same excitement as smartphones did 15 years ago,\" said Davidson in an email. \"It's a new category, and I want to be part of the innovations that propel it forward.\" The Amazon Echo, which is powered by the Alexa voice assistant, has caught the world by storm, surprising many with its success. According to a research report in May, consumer awareness of the Echo reached almost 50 percent by the end of last year, up from about 20 percent in March 2015. And, now with the holiday season fast approaching, some think the Echo could be one of the hottest gifts. Amazon has big plans for Alexa, and just this week GeekWire reported that the company had secured a patent to put the artificial intelligence engine into small drones. Davidson said Alexa represents an exciting opportunity, one he did not want to pass up. But won't he miss the energy of a startup? Not really. \"Amazon is an entrepreneurial company, and being part of Alexa is like being in a startup in a sense,\" he said. \"It's a new category, exciting product, and offers some similar challenges of a startup.\" Amazon's ability to stay entrepreneurial, even as it has grown to nearly 270,000 employees, is certainly phenomenal. But some have wondered in recent months -- including folks like me -- whether companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and others are taking some of the wind out of the Seattle startup sails. Davidson doesn't necessarily think so. \"Seattle has a lot of opportunity right now, and it's an exciting place to be as a tech entrepreneur. I think it just depends on what you're looking for,\" he said. \"There are a lot of entrepreneurs at Amazon, even ones that may not be thought of as entrepreneurs just because they have been there for a while. Amazon is working on many interesting things, and is an attractive place for people who want to work on those types of innovations.\" ",

The Vancouver, Wash.-based startup today announced a $3 million round to help grow its software platform that automates the processes around event planning. Investors in the Series A round include Oregon Angel Fund and Elevate Capital, a new firm that invested from its first \"Inclusive\" fund that was created by the Portland Development Commission (PDC) last year to help provide capital to early-stage companies founded by underrepresented groups. Founded in 2012 by CEO Allie Magyar, Hubb helps event managers streamline collecting, managing, and marketing content for meetings and conferences with its cloud-based platform. The software collects all the required content from speakers and exhibitors, manages scheduling, and calculates attendance for events both big and small.  Hubb has 60 customers that include big companies like Microsoft, Tableau, Intel, Akamai, and others. It is also working with technology providers to integrate its platform into apps, registration systems, and more. Magyar told GeekWire that other conference software companies offer legacy technology that is less flexible and doesn't meet customer needs. \"Hubb is created by meeting managers for meeting managers, and solves the problems our team experienced in over 10 years of managing and marketing event content ourselves for some of the top technology companies in the world,\" she said. \"It's designed from the ground up to be easy to use, with best in breed technology and is purpose-built to solve the most pressing needs of busy conference planners.\" Hubb, which employs 19, previously raised a $1 million seed round and won a $140,000 prize from the Bend Venture Conference last week.

It's a big round for the startup company, which left Seattle for San Francisco shortly after graduating from the Techstars program in 2012. The latest round brings total funding in Leanplum to $46 million. The company, which focuses on mobile marketing, engagement and testing, plans to double its headcount of 80 by the end of next year, according to AdExchanger. The money will go toward hiring more engineers and growing globally. Leanplum says it has a customer base of more than 100 top brands, including Tinder, Lyft and Zynga. Leanplum isn't the only Techstars 2012 alum to move out of the area. Geo-tagged story sharing platform Maptia moved from Seattle to Morocco in 2015, after the founders' visas expired. Other Techstars companies have stayed home and landed big rounds of financing. One example is Matt Oppenheimer-led Remitly, which describes itself as the largest independent mobile remittance company in the U.S. A 2011 Techstars grad, Remitly just last month reeled in $38 million in venture funding, and it continues to expand its money lending platform around the world.

      "content": "Etailz co-founder and CEO Josh Neblett. Photo via Etailz.\n Etailz is almost a too-perfect-to-be-true startup success story. The company grew out of a college business plan competition at Gonzaga University, where Josh Neblett and Sarah Wollnick, now married, took first place in 2008. Soon they were running the startup as a two-person operation out of the office of Gonzaga entrepreneurship professor and former venture capitalist Tom Simpson, an advisor and early backer. But things have changed over the years, and Etailz this week received huge validation when it announced that it was selling for $75 million to powerhouse entertainment retailer Trans World Entertainment. It was a significant outcome for the 30-year-old Neblett, and the rest of the Etailz team. Over the past eight years, they've built a successful group of five niche e-commerce sites --greencupboards.com; ecomom.com; coybeauty.com; everycasa.com; and vaultelectronics.com -- as well as a services business that help companies expand their reach on online marketplaces. Between September 2015 and September 2016, Etailz posted revenue of $116 million and a healthy profit, and now employs about 190 people. Not bad for a guy who started the business as a senior in college as a \"glorified science project.\" \"We were never looking to sell,\" Neblett told GeekWire in an interview today, \"we were looking for a partner that would enable us to exponentially grow our brand and our mission of what we're trying to accomplish.\" \"And it really came down to this mindset of 1 plus 1 could equal 4. They have stuff they're really good at, we have stuff we're really good at, and together it could be something much greater than it could be independently,\" he said. Neblett said the brick-and-mortar expertise of Trans World Entertainment, which owns entertainment retailer F.Y.E., and Etailz' strength in digital commerce will compliment each other and help both companies to grow into new markets. Keep reading for an edited Q&A with Neblett, and find more details on Etailz acquisition here. GeekWire: Why was now the right time to sell? Neblett: We were never looking to sell. Even through this process, we've always built with the mindset of being here 20 years from now, building for the long term, and if at the right time we emerge as an industry leader there might be a partnership that makes sense. We were never looking to sell... it really came down to this mindset of 1 plus 1 could equal 4.But even through this process, we weren't necessarily looking to sell, we were looking for a partner that would enable us to exponentially grow our brand and our mission of what we're trying to accomplish. And it really came down to this mindset of 1 plus 1 could equal 4. They have stuff they're really good at, we have stuff we're really good at, and together it could be something much greater than it could be independently. And so that's how we looked at it, and the timing was kind of irrelevant it was jus the right partner, the right fit. GeekWire: You built the business with very little outside capital, just $1.56 million invested. What are your bootstrapping tips? Neblett: Bootstrapping is a mindset not a weakness (or) disadvantage. Others who are bootstrapping should be focused on becoming an industry leader within their niche and not making decision to hopefully one day get bought out... Become an industry leader, build a sustainable business and you'll be in a position of strength in the future.\" GeekWire: What changed your mindset from a partnership to an acquisition? Neblett:  Retail-to-retail is very difficult. In a partnership that wasn't a wholly-owned subsidiary, which is what we've become, retail-to-retail is very difficult. So going into the conversations, the way that it made most sense business-wise was to become a wholly-owned subsidiary. GeekWire: What advantages will the acquisition bring Etailz? Neblett: We get to gain their expertise, their leverage, their talent, their resources. There's all sorts of advantages of the relations that they have, exclusives that they have -- just the overall fact that they're the last man standing in their industry, yet there's still real opportunity there. All of those things are things that we couldn't replicate. And quite frankly, we know there's a good business within brick and mortar, yet we (Etailz) were not great at that. F.Y.E. -- Trans World -- is. That's their specialty. And so we recognize there's a value there to the future, they recognize obviously the internet has a huge value, and combining those things made a lot of sense. GeekWire: What has it been like taking Etailz from such a small operation to such a successful exit?  We look at this as, 'I'm locked in, I'm not going anywhere.\" Neblett: It was a glorified science project early on, coming out of a classroom project. and raising a little bit of money, and most of the people I raised money from -- it was tough -- but the only reason, a lot of times, they gave us money because we were this college student and all that. I think they were expecting a glorified science project... I met with a lot of them yesterday, and they were all talking about how they wished they had put in more, of course. But on the whole exit thing, we really don't look at it as an exit. We look at this as, \"I'm locked in, I'm not going anywhere.\" I still think that our mission of what we're trying to accomplish at etailz, we're barely scraping the tip of the iceberg. And because of that I still have a lot to do to accomplish what I'm trying to do here, so we're all here. There's still this level of autonomy that we will operate, it's just now tapping into these resources and tools so we can be something greater together. So the experience has been great for me, obviously, coming out of college bright eyed and bushy tailed fire in the belly, whatever you want to call it, to just be able to grow my role and myself and just continue to try to make an impact fo the employees and what we're trying to accomplish. It's just been very rewarding and fun. GeekWire: You plan on staying in Spokane, correct? Neblett: Correct. There's an immense amount of talent here in Spokane, and quite frankly we get to be a big fish in a small pond with regards to the entrepreneurial scene here. So it allows us to recruit and retain talent compared to if we were in the bay area  or Seattle -- we would just be another cool startup. Whereas here we have a lot more clout. GeekWire: How would you compare Spokane's culture to Seattle? Neblett: The quality of life in Spokane is unparalleled. No traffic, you've got 10 different lakes that are within 40 minutes of each other, you have the mountains during the winter, yet you have all the major stores and retailers and everything you could want access to right here. So all of those things really play heavily into the quality of life here. Cost of living is substantially less than Seattle and other places. So all these things play into our favor from a business standpoint. I grew up in the Seattle area, so I have a fond appreciation for Seattle. That said, now that I've been in Spokane and experienced all the things Spokane has to offer, I will likely -- never say never -- but I will likely be staying put for the future here.   ",

He quickly learned that the travel space was too broad and narrowed his focus to a marketplace for videographers. The result was Vidpal, an on-demand marketplace that allows videographers to sell their services and customers to request them. For the past four months, Vidpal has been incubating in Seattle's 9Mile Labs accelerator. Last week, Ortega debuted the product on stage and Milestone 9 Demo Day. We caught up with Ortega for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"Vidpal is an on-demand video platform that allows you to request a video shoot in near real time.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"We began to receive requests for various operations like real estate, sports, and travel.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"We are totally not ready for VCs yet because most VCs want at least $10,000 in revenue per month. We are ready for an Angel investment, clearly. We have bootstrapped and gone through an incubator and later, Seattle-based accelerator 9-Mile Labs.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"We are able to connect videographers with businesses in a one-click service by using an Uber-like location mapping service that sets local videographers up directly with the request.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Our smartest move has been moving over to serve businesses as our primary target. Also, we feel that our widget and subscription services have been helpful.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Attempting to serve a market (travel) that was entirely too wide for us.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Zuckerberg or Bezos, I think Zuckerberg can help us better address our market and Bezos has an experienced resume that would be helpful.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Coding, we are techies.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"A go-getter who is willing to go the extra mile. Someone that understands how much this company will be worth in just a small amount of time.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Don't let the rough times get to you.

Photo via iInnovate Network.\n There is a myriad of resources in Seattle that incubate and mentor fledgling startups -- Techstars, 9Mile Labs, and Madrona Venture Labs are just a few. But once a startup's training wheels are off and the company starts to scale and become profitable, those resources drop away, leaving mid-sized startups with few support systems. Randy Ottinger, Seattle tech entrepreneur and investor, is hoping to fill that gap with the iInnovate Network, a peer leadership group for tech founders, CEOs, and other C-level executives that launched on Tuesday. \"By creating a broad and diverse group of CEOs that meet regularly in forum groups of around 12 members, in a confidential setting, CEOs can discuss virtually any issue that impacts their companies or themselves personally and as leaders,\" Ottinger told GeekWire via email. He said the network is ideal for leaders running companies that have the funding to operate and scale. These leaders have moved beyond the initial grind of founding a startup and getting it off the ground, and instead face challenges like creating a high-performance culture, hiring top talent, raising growth capital, and even acquiring companies or selling their own company, Ottinger said. \"My hope is that iInnovate will help more entrepreneurs with great ideas become successful as they grow their companies, and can help further strengthen the Greater Seattle tech ecosystem for many years,\" he said. Membership in the network runs at $500 per month or $6,000 for a 12-month period. iInnovate has signed some big names to its board of advisors, including Heather Redman, noted Seattle angel investor; Michael Schutzler, CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association; and Arthur J. Buerk, co-founder of the University of Washington Foster School for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. The network will offer members regular meetings in small groups, led by \"iLeaders\" that are professional coaches with backgrounds in the tech industry. iLeaders will also offer individual coaching for members between meetings.

(Photos via eEailz.)\n Etailz, a digital marketplace consultant and online retailer that operates sites such as Ecomom, EveryCasa and GreenCupboards, was acquired today by Trans World Entertainment for $75 million in cash and stock, a surprising development for the largely bootstrapped startup. Etailz was founded by Josh Neblett in 2008 as a 21-year-old senior at Gonzaga University in Spokane. He chose to keep the business there, and it has since grown from just two employees to a sizable digital marketplace, with growing profits and revenues. Over the 12-month period ended September 2016, Etailz posted $116 million in revenue. And from 2013 to 2015, sales grew from $27 million to $93 million. Operating income also has grown, rising from $800,000 to $3.4 million between 2013 and 2015. The company made the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest growing companies four years in a row, and also ranked 57th on the GeekWire 200, a list of the top privately-held tech companies in the Pacific Northwest. Neblett originally planned to become a financial advisor, but decided to take a swing at entrepreneurship during his last year at school. He worked closely with Spokane investor Tom Simpson -- who also happened to be Neblett's entrepreneurship professor at Gonzaga -- to get the concept of Etailz off the ground. \"We adhere to a strict bootstrap mentality, are focused on profitability and plan to build the company for the long-term,\" Neblett told GeekWire in a 2012 interview. The company raised a small amount of angel investment -- about $1.56 million in funding -- to fuel the business, but it largely grew through its own profits. We've reached out to the company to get more details, and we'll update this post as we hear more. A conference call is slated for Tuesday morning. Etailz was originally founded as GreenCupboards.com, an eco-friendly product marketplace. It changed its name to Etailz after acquiring Ecomom in 2013, and has expanded to offer five niche retail sites: greencupboards.com, an eco-friendly retailer; ecomom.com, selling family-oriented eco-friendly products; coybeauty.com, a beauty product retailer; everycasa.com, a home product retailer; and vaultelectronics.com, an electronics retailer. The company also provides consulting and proprietary software for companies in the online marketplace and e-commerce arenas, and is one of the top ten retailers on the Amazon Marketplace. Trans World Entertainment is a New York-based entertainment conglomerate, which operates CD, DVD, and Blueray retail locations across the U.S. under the For Your Entertainment and Suncoast brands. The company's stock rose over 8 percent to $3.72 per share in after-hours trading on Monday following the announcement. According to the release, Trans World paid $36.2 million in cash and issued 5.7 million shares of TWMC stock to Etailz shareholders (valued at $19.6 million based on the closing stock price on October 14). It also assumed liability of Etailz $4.2 million employee retention bonus plan, of which $1.9 million was paid at closing. An earn-out of up to $14.6 million will be payable in 2018 and 2019, provided that Etailz achieves $6 million in operating income in 2017 and $7.5 million in 2018. Etailz headquarters will remain in Spokane and all of its management team with \"digital marketplace expertise\" will stay on board, according to the release. \"We look forward to accessing the relationships, operational expertise and infrastructure they have built to help unlock the full potential of Etailz and accelerating our progress towards being the industry leader for digital marketplace sales and expertise,\" Neblett said in the release.

      "content": "Poppy founder Avni Patel Thompson.\n Avni Patel Thompson had a great idea for a business -- a vetted, on-demand childcare service -- but like many women considering taking the startup plunge, she faced barriers to entry. So instead of jumping in head first, she decided to start by getting her feet wet. She took the $180 that remained in her bank account after her first unsuccessful startup and gave herself four weeks to get 100 paying customers. Instead of a launch, she called it a \"test.\" The result was Poppy. \"Calling it a test made it feel less daunting to me and gave me an easy out if it was an utter disaster,\" she said. \"Committing only four weeks made me treat each day with urgency because I only had 28 of them to prove that my idea could become a viable business. Using less than $200 made me scrappy and forced me to find solutions I hadn't thought about before. Finally, seeking just 100 paying customers (and just four that first week) made me focus on a goal that seemed within reach.\" Patel Thompson believes following this model can help other women become entrepreneurs and she's launching a program to prove it. She's inviting women in the Pacific Northwest, who have an idea, to take the \"4-week startup\" test. Those accepted into the program will take $200 of their own money (financial assistance will be available for those who need it) and spend four weeks building their products. The goal is to reach 25 paying customers with 30 percent weekly growth. \"There is a lot of research that shows how women pursue perfection, or are more risk-averse or are less likely to talk about their ideas,\" said Patel Thompson. \"Well, using this approach helps overcome much of those inclinations. I realized that having a structured, approachable way for female founders to get off the ground is the best way to get acting on the problem instead of dissecting it more.\" Patel Thompson is aiming to have 10 to 20 entrepreneurs in the program. She already has a handful committed. She and a group of Seattle entrepreneurs and investors will meet with participants each week to provide mentorship, guidance, and \"someone else to be accountable to.\" After the four-week test is complete, Patel may be able to connect startups with investors in her community. \"There is no 'good' time to have kids or launch an idea,\" said Patel Thompson. \"This I know to be utterly true. And if there are any lessons to be salvaged from this election cycle it's this: It is women's time to be big and bold and brave.\" (Editor's note: GeekWire Chairman Jonathan Sposato is an investor in Poppy).

      "content": "President Barack Obama speaking the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh. Photo: White House.\n It's a comment we hear all the time: Government should run more like a startup, to be more agile, efficient and timely. But President Obama doesn't see it that way. Speaking at the White House Frontiers Conference, Obama said Washington D.C. will never run like Silicon Valley, because the government fundamentally can't operate like a business would. Instead of being accountable to investors and customers, like a startup, Obama pointed out that the government is accountable to a huge variety of populations in the U.S., with a huge variety of needs and values. \"And that's hard and it's messy, and we're building up legacy systems that we can't just blow up,\" he said. Obama said the sentiment in the science, tech, and entrepreneur communities -- that the entire system needs to be overhauled and built again -- is misguided. The system isn't broken, the two modes are just playing by different rules, he said. He did agree that there are improvements to be made to the way government runs. But, for now, the vision of more agile, pivoting government and a rooftop dog park on the White House remain a pipe dream. Read Obama's pertinent comments in full below, and the full transcript here. The final thing I'll say is that government will never run the way Silicon Valley runs because, by definition, democracy is messy.  This is a big, diverse country with a lot of interests and a lot of disparate points of view.  And part of government's job, by the way, is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with. So sometimes I talk to CEOs, they come in and they start telling me about leadership, and here's how we do things.  And I say, well, if all I was doing was making a widget or producing an app, and I didn't have to worry about whether poor people could afford the widget, or I didn't have to worry about whether the app had some unintended consequences -- setting aside my Syria and Yemen portfolio -- then I think those suggestions are terrific... That's not, by the way, to say that there aren't huge efficiencies and improvements that have to be made. But the reason I say this is sometimes we get, I think, in the scientific community, the tech community, the entrepreneurial community, the sense of we just have to blow up the system, or create this parallel society and culture because government is inherently wrecked.  No, it's not inherently wrecked; it's just government has to care for, for example, veterans who come home. That's not on your balance sheet, that's on our collective balance sheet, because we have a sacred duty to take care of those veterans.  And that's hard and it's messy, and we're building up legacy systems that we can't just blow up. ",

      "content": "The Zipwhip management team. Photo via Zipwhip.\n With the proliferation of so many messaging apps, from Facebook Messenger to WhatsApp to Snapchat, it may seem like SMS texting is not relevant anymore. Zipwhip's latest fundraising round certainly proves that theory wrong. The Seattle startup today announced a $9 million Series B investment led by Voyager Capital. Microsoft's new formal venture fund, Microsoft Ventures, also participated, revealing the 11th company it is backing. GCI, which built Alaska's largest wireless network, and Inteliquent, a leading provider of VoIP services, also invested. Zipwhip's technology lets companies text their customers from the web, desktop computers and smartphones, working across the U.S. wireless carriers. Founded in 2007, the company originally targeted consumers and set out to be the \"Facebook of text messaging.\" But it pivoted around 2013, taking a different approach by enabling hundreds of millions of landlines to receive and send text messages for the first time. This allowed companies to text with their customers from landline phones and toll-free numbers. That ended up being a smart decision, as Zipwhip has gone on to attract hundreds of clients from industries like insurance, automotive, staffing, fitness, transportation, radio, and medical that use Zipwhip's technology for scenarios including customer service, appointment scheduling, and sales. The business text messaging volume facilitated on its platform is up 300 percent year-over-year. \"Businesses are late adopters,\" Zipwhip CEO John Lauer told GeekWire. \"They don't want the new thing and they don't want to What's App-enable or Facebook Messenger-enable their business. They just want to text-enable because everyone has texting.\" The fresh cash, which pushes total funding for the 100-person company near $20 million, will be used to grow the sales team and for product development. Zipwhip last reported that it was on pace to do $10 million in annual recurring revenue by Q3 of this year. \"We are going through such an amazing growth stage and the market we are tackling is so massive that it makes sense to raise more money to accelerate growth beyond what we're already seeing,\" Lauer said. Zipwhip's growth is a clear indication that SMS is still an important, and lucrative, messaging platform. Lauer noted that the most-used application on iOS and Android is still the native-texting app which comes pre-loaded on a smartphone. We're also seeing new startups like lunch delivery platform Peach and chat commerce platform ReplyYes build their entire business around SMS. \"Texting is so ubiquitous but businesses are generally left out in the cold,\" Lauer said. \"Zipwhip's goal is to solve that problem, and the way you solve it is to give businesses fast texting software.\"  Zipwhip describes itself as a software-as-a-service company, versus a text messaging API -- \"a car dealership or dentist's office has no idea what to do with an API,\" Lauer noted. Its platform lets customers log into a web portal to read and send text messages. \"We build software that really is the equivalent of Microsoft Server Exchange in the cloud, and Outlook as the desktop client,\" Lauer said. Customers include car dealerships, whose salespeople use Zipwhip to negotiate the sale of a car over SMS, for example. Insurance brokerages, credit unions, radio stations, and sports franchises are also clients. After the first three months of using Zipwhip to improve fan communication with the team, the Portland Timbers customer service department reduced email activity by 34 percent and phone activity by 31 percent. \"They are conducting business over text messaging,\" Lauer said.  Part of Zipwhip's success is due to contracts it inked with big wireless carriers a few years ago that allowed the company to create industry policies which text-enabled existing hardline numbers. It also worked with carriers to enable commercial-grade, high-volume connectivity for their clients, who pay Zipwhip depending on the number of text messages they send and receive. Lauer also said it is important to note that SMS is \"the only open communication medium we have for messaging.\" \"In an open ecosystem, everybody invests and everyone participates,\" he noted. \"The open nature of it is why it's going to be here for many years to come.\" Lauer said Zipwhip may double its 100-person workforce by the end of next year. It plans to \"significantly\" grow its 50-person inside sales team. The Microsoft Ventures investment in Zipwhip is notable, considering that it's part of the first cohort of companies that Microsoft is backing via its new fund. \"What's so interesting about Microsoft participating in this round is that they're looking at us and saying, 'OK, we dominate the email space with respect to business software, and email is an open communication medium,'\" Lauer explained. \"Texting is emerging as an equivalently-important open communication medium. Some company will dominate the business software for that open communication medium, and we are in that position.\" One of Zipwhip's competitors, Haywire, was recently acquired by Salesforce. Asked about a potential acquisition, Lauer said that Zipwhip is \"super-focused on growth.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

The company inked a deal this week with Portland-based startup Vadio to allow users to access a playlist of music videos when searching for a song. Founded in 2012, Vadio is essentially a media matchmaker, helping companies that already stream music online also show the music video of a given song at the same time. The idea is to offer users an added visual element to their listening experience, while giving the streaming companies another medium to create a new advertising revenue stream. \"By incorporating high quality video, Shazam is making it possible for brands and artists to provide new ways for its global audience to discover music,\" Bryce Clemmer, co-founder and CEO at Vadio, said in a statement. Revenue from ad sales on the channels are split between the digital platform, Vadio, and the content curator. Vadio is a graduate of the Portland Incubator Experiment and Portland Seed Fund.

      "content": "9MileLabs co-founder Sanjay Puri speaks at Demo Day on Thursday in Seattle. (GeekWire photos)\n After four months of hard work, valuable mentorship, and plenty of late nights, another cohort from 9Mile Labs graduated on Thursday in Seattle. It's been three-and-a-half years since the B2B accelerator launched, making 65 investments in a variety of startups since then. The accelerator invests anywhere from $35,000 to $105,000 in exchange for 7 to 10 percent of a startup's equity, while providing workspace, connections, and more. Founders from the latest group, hailed as \"Milestone 9,\" pitched their ideas on stage in front of 400 people at the Showbox Sodo on Thursday afternoon. They ranged from a virtual reality storytelling content management platform to a company that wants to rethink how we manage email. \"How many different events have you been to where you see such a diversity of companies, going from virtual reality to ad-tech to communication to bitcoin -- this is a phenomenal group,\" 9Mile Labs co-founder Sanjay Puri said on stage. \"I'm proud of how far they've come over the past four months. They've really put in an incredible amount of work.\" Sandy Sharma, who co-founded 9Mile Labs with Puri and Kevin Croy, lauded the Seattle region for its robust technology ecosystem, citing the strong companies in the GeekWire 200 and the fact that so many out-of-town tech giants have established engineering centers in the area. But he also pointed out that Seattle doesn't rank among the top cities around the world when it comes to angel investing and venture capital activity. \"The companies are not allowed to solicit,\" he said on stage. \"But I would encourage every accredited investor here to think about making an investment or a commitment to do so.\" Impinj CEO and founder Chris Diorio, who took his company public in August -- 16 years after launching -- gave the keynote speech. He shared the origin story of Impinj and offered leadership advice to entrepreneurs -- more to come on that later. GeekWire watched all eight pitches and we've come up with our three favorite, which you can see below. You can also read about each company with our Startup Spotlight series. Talentful CEO Jia Chen had the strongest pitch of the afternoon, outlining a problem tech companies struggle with everyday -- finding talented engineers -- and clearly explaining why his startup can help. Chen, along with co-founders Kelvin Chen and Matt Gu, want take some of the pain out of hiring tech talent with their turn-key platform that uses data science and machine learning to quickly surface a list of potential new software developers. The problem is clear -- Chen said that $12 billion was spent on recruiting engineers last year, but more than 56 percent of hiring managers were disappointed with the quality of their talent pipeline. It also takes an average of 45 days to close a hire, Chen added. Chen explained that tech giants like Facebook and Amazon have built their own internal artificial intelligence tools to help streamline this process and identify talent. Talentful wants to target every other software company that may not have the resources to build something on their own. Talentful does deep profile analysis technology on potential candidates -- their past employment history; the type of companies they've worked at; programming language knowledge; personality; etc. -- while also tapping into the social networks of current employees to target potential friends and connections that might make a good fit. \"The benefits are obvious,\" Chen said. \"We help tech companies make really informed hiring decisions on developers super fast, and we make it extremely easy to turn your employees into recruiters. This guarantees a unique sourcing channel, and as a result, we can drastically increase the quality of the talent pipeline while cutting down the delay in hiring.\" Talentful already has customers ranging from INRIX, Booz Allen Hamilton, and Rover.com. CakeCodes CEO Simon Yu had the quote of the day. \"Our users get paid for playing games,\" he said, describing CakeCodes. \"Imagine that -- getting paid for playing games. It's the lifelong dream for millennials across the world.\" But Yu's pitch also had substance beyond a funny line or two. CakeCodes' business model is simple: it rewards users with bitcoin for trying out new products, games, and services. Yu said the mobile ad industry, while booming, is \"highly ineffective and overpriced.\" He explained how ad publishers pay for clicks, installs, and impressions, but often times even if a user sees and clicks on an ad, he or she won't actually engage. \"This is a huge problem,\" Yu said. Yu said that CakeCodes is able to drive a 7-to-10X higher retention rate than traditional mobile advertising. It keeps 70 percent of what ad publishers pay, and distributes 30 percent to users. His team has been able to attract 150,000 monthly active users with little-to-no marketing spend. \"CakeCodes wins because we generate revenue by driving value to both sides of the market,\" Yu said. The company reminds me of Spare5, a Seattle startup that pays users to complete basic tasks on their smartphone in their spare time. I'm not so sure the bitcoin aspect of CakeCodes is strong -- what if it also offered to pay cash or gift cards, as well? Regardless, the potential for CakeCodes is intriguing, particularly given that the company's platform can be used by people all around the world. While the team is young, I like their passion and entrepreneurial roots. Yu said he took $100 as a 19-year-old and used it to build a $500,000 taco truck business. Touchmail CEO Matthew Carlson didn't have the best pitch I've ever seen -- I don't really enjoy the word \"revolutionary\" used within the first 10 seconds -- but his company's traction and accolades speak for themselves. TouchMail is a mobile and visual-focused app for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 that takes advantage of touch interfaces to help people sort and view emails. The problem TouchMail is trying to alleviate is obvious. Trying to sort through hundreds or thousands of emails, separating important messages from the junk, is such a common pain point for so many users. \"Email is super crucial,\" Carlson noted. \"But it hasn't really evolved with the devices we use it on now, or even fundamentally changed in the last 30 years.\" TouchMail differs from list-based email platforms by using colorful and visual tiles instead that help users categorize between different messages and senders. The app, which supports Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail, and other clients, has racked up more than one million downloads to date in the Windows Store.  There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about TouchMail. The company released its first paid upgrade last year and reeled in $100,000 in sales; it also has a \"great relationship\" with Microsoft, Carlson said. \"There are already 400 million devices running Windows 10,\" he added. \"With the rapid growth of 2-in-1 devices, we are in the right place at the right time with the right product.\" Now the startup is preparing to release an Android version of its app later this year, and later on iOS. \"So far, we have done a lot with a little,\" Carlson said. \"We've been a very lean, powerful team.\" Here are photos of the other founders, as well as links to the respective spotlights (Vidpal will be featured next week in GeekWire): ",

Photo via CharityCheckin.\n When Marsh Sutherland lost his wife to a battle with cancer, he started looking for ways to raise awareness for his personal causes. That's when he realized there was an opportunity to build something that let people spread awareness while also helping retailers and brand advertise via user-generated content. The result is CharityCheckin, a Spokane, Wash.-based startup led by Sutherland that describes itself as a philanthropic Facebook advertising platform for retailers and brands. \"Our goal is to become the world's largest giving engine,\" Sutherland said. The year-old company, now working as part of the current 9MileLabs cohort in Seattle, lets users pick a charity and check-in on social media while visiting a given retailer. Once their activity is posted to Facebook, that retailer donates to the charity. Users can also receive coupons from said retailer. We caught up with CharityCheckin for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"CharityCheckin enables brands and retailers to advertise on our users' Facebook walls with branded check-ins in exchange for a small donation to the user's favorite charity.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"Marsh's wife Betsy lost her two-and-a-half year battle with cancer. His young son Sean is challenged daily because of his autism. While looking for ways to raise awareness and money for his personal causes, he realized everyone has a personal cause -- something they or ones they love have been affected by. Our goal is to connect our users with businesses willing to support our users' causes and eliminate the friction from year-round philanthropy.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Funding from 9Mile Labs in Cohort VI and bootstrapping.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Facebook reduced the reach of Page posts from businesses by 80 percent. And when businesses do advertise, they look like ads in the ads News Feed, which is largely ignored. We are the only platform that allows companies to advertise in the organic Facebook News Feed via our user-generated posts to friends and followers, driving more brand awareness and foot traffic.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Moving to Seattle for 9Mile Labs accelerator. The knowledge transfer, mentoring and relationships are truly world-class.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Building our app with OrientDB graph database hosted on Google. We are migrating to SQL Azure hosted on Microsoft Azure via the Microsoft BizSpark program.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Bill Gates, because he is a cultural fit having founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, our tech stack is entirely Microsoft, and he is the biggest philanthropist in the world while we aim to become the world's largest giving engine.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Drinking beer and eating steamed lobsters -- we are Boston guys.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"If they have a personal cause based on something or someone they love that has been affected. We also look for an emotional connect for a personal cause for vendor selection, too. We want our supply chain links to truly have their hearts into making a real difference in the world for the causes they care about.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Get traction with paying users as soon as possible and keep growing the traction as fast as you can.\" Editor's note: GeekWire is featuring each of the startups in 9Mile Labs' fall cohort.

      "content": "The Fresh Toast President and COO Eric Snow, Editor-in-Chief Kelly Barbieri, and Founder and Publisher JJ McKay at the launch party in New York City.\n JJ McKay and an impressive suite of investors believe there's serious demand for a cannabis lifestyle brand that's decidedly more Martha Stewart than Snoop Dogg. To fill that need, the Seattle startup advisor and relationships guru launched The Fresh Toast. The online media company is 50 percent light-hearted, shareable mainstream content and 50 percent information targeted at casual cannabis users and people interested in marijuana as medicine. \"Doing research, I realized that if we can present information to the groups, the demographics that we had identified in a way that they were used to, they would come and we could help transform and redefine the industry and be a market-maker like Martha Stewart,\" said McKay, who is well known in Seattle philanthropic circles. The Fresh Toast is headquartered in Seattle and its main content office is in New York City. A beta version of the site is live, with sections like \"Hot Mess,\" \"HighWay\" and \"Rx.\" The Rx vertical, which provides advice and resources related to medicinal marijuana, is a key revenue source for the company. The Fresh Toast plans to use its Rx directory services and advertising to generate initial profits. Eventually, the company will add live entertainment (The Fresh Toast Stage), sponsored events, a marketplace, and data research as revenue sources. The Fresh Toast's target audience sees cannabis \"as one facet of their daily life,\" says McKay. \"It's not a definer. They look at it like vodka or lattes or aspirin.\" Because half of the content on the site is unrelated to pot, The Fresh Toast is able to skirt Facebook's policies that prevent other cannabis blogs, like High Times, from promoting on the social network. It is also the first marijuana-related brand approved by Google Adsense, according to McKay. The Fresh Toast has raised $2 million from Glen Johnson, former CFO of Alaska Air Group, Caroline Kelly, former president of The Seattle Times, and Rob Goodman from American Medical Companies in Portland. The company -- which joins other high-profile and heavily-funded cannabis-oriented startups in Seattle such as Privateer Holdings and Headset -- is in the process of raising an additional $800,000. \"We do think we will redefine the market and our initial responses are saying that,\" said McKay.

      "content": "Pioneer Square Labs co-founder Greg Gottesman (left) interviewed by GeekWire reporter Taylor Soper at the 2016 GeekWire Summit. Photo by Dan DeLong/GeekWire.\n \"Fail fast\" seems to be the theme at Pioneer Square Labs. It's been about one year since the Seattle-based \"startup studio\" launched after raising a $12.5 million round from 13 venture capital firms and more than 50 angel investors. Backed by premier investors and led by an experienced team with accomplished entrepreneurs, PSL uses a unique innovation model to rapidly test and validate new startup ideas before recruiting an executive team to build out an actual spin-off company. PSL starts with an original idea and spends roughly four months working hard to quickly validate it, using the fresh investment round it raised for financial support. That means building prototypes, talking with customers, doing market analysis, etc. -- a \"fail fast\" process that helps separate signal from noise. Then it recruits an appropriate executive team to build off the work that's already been done and ultimately spin the new startup out of PSL into its own entity. Co-founder Greg Gottesman, who started the studio with Geoff Entress, Mike Galgon, and Ben Gilbert, revealed some details about the past year at PSL during a fireside chat at the GeekWire Summit last week in Seattle. He said that the studio worked on 25 separate startup ideas, killing all but three over the course of a year. One of those ideas was LumaTax, a company that aims to automate sales tax reporting for small businesses and last month announced a $2 million financing round from Madrona Venture Group, Greycroft Partners and angel investors. Another was Jet Closing, an app that helps streamline the real estate closing experience. So what happened to the 21 other ideas? Gottesman, who served as managing director at Madrona Venture Group for 18 years before moving to a part-time role so he could focus on PSL, said that the studio typically looks to make a decision on an idea within four months. \"Our hit rate is actually relatively low because we are really looking for product market fit and customer validation,\" he said. \"We are really quick to kill.\" \"Fail fast\" is a well-known phrase in the startup world -- or \"fail forward\" and \"fail better\" -- used by many entrepreneurs and investors to describe the process of rapidly identifying bad ideas and iterations as a way to ultimately arrive at a successful solution. Some people, like venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, don't like the mentality. Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco last month, Andreessen said \"fail fast\" makes sense for tactics -- \"if a tactic doesn't work, find another tactic.\" But not so much for longer-term goals. \"I think 'fail fast' is catastrophic if it is applied to strategy and goals,\" Andreessen explained. \"A lot of founders talk themselves out of what are going to be good ideas in the long run because they aren't getting immediate traction.\" But PSL is much different than one startup, or an accelerator or incubator -- and \"fail fast\" seems to be working well thus far. The studio looks for ideas that can be tested in a small way to get a sense for early traction. There's not a particular industry that Gottesman and his colleagues are honing in on, but they aren't looking at long-term plays in industries like deep enterprise software or life sciences, for example. Even after months of testing, it's not easy to predict if a given startup will find success. But one metric PSL tries to focus on is unit economics -- something that investors are starting to prioritize when assessing startup ideas. For example, one of the 22 ideas that didn't come to fruition was an eSports company that helped gamers receive instruction from a professional, much like an athlete might find a coach to improve his or her ability on the basketball court or golf course. People loved the service, and there were many repeat customers. But the unit economics didn't quite work out -- a typical user had to go through 10 coaching sessions for the company to break even. \"The unit economics didn't feel right, so we killed that business even though a lot of things about it were going well,\" Gottesman said. \"That's a typical reason we might kill something -- there may be a problem we are solving, but we just can't make enough money for it to make sense in terms of being a big business.\" Ironically, a customer using that eSports platform launched something similar under a different name a few weeks later and was able to raise several million dollars in venture capital financing. \"Maybe someone else saw something we didn't,\" Gottesman said. \"But we didn't see it.\" On that note, asked if entrepreneurs should keep their startup ideas to themselves for fear of someone else stealing the concept, Gottesman said he doesn't think so. \"I've always been of the belief that I'd rather take the risk of telling a lot of people about my idea -- if they can out-execute me, I was going to lose anyways,\" he said. \"Even though there is a risk and people do copy other people's ideas, I think getting that smart feedback from customers and investors is always worth it.\" PSL will reveal details about its two other spin-outs in the coming weeks, so stay tuned to GeekWire for those announcements.

      "content": "VIAR CEO Jernej Mirt.\n By the summer of 2015, VIAR was nearly bankrupt. The product -- virtual reality tours to help architects show clients future construction -- just wasn't gaining traction. The end seemed near for CEO Jernej Mirt and his team but then an unexpected request changed everything. A local company asked if VIAR could make a custom-branded VR headset, like the ones they'd been using for virtual tours. \"We were not going to decline someone wanting to give us money,\" said Mirt. \"As soon as we got back to work on our software, we had another request for custom-printed VR goggles.\" He quickly realized there was a market for custom-printed VR headsets and VR apps for companies looking to use new technology. \"We went out to look for a client that would buy a custom VR app and custom VR headsets,\" said Mirt. \"It took us 10 days to find and close the first customer.\" As VIAR moved in a new direction, the team realized there was yet another pain point to be solved. Many clients found it difficult to distribute the apps VIAR had built for them. They began work on a content management system that automated the process and eventually launched Viar360, a publishing platform for VR apps. \"The platform went into public beta at the beginning of September and is already generating revenue,\" he said. We caught up with Mirt for this installment of Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"You don't really have to know how to code to build a webpage, right? You just go to Wix or Squarespace and make it in seconds. Well, Viar360 does the same -- it allows someone to easily combine 360-degree videos and pictures to create virtual reality experiences with no coding involved.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"We realized that we were building a lot of virtual reality applications that were very repetitive and easy to build. We wanted to make the process easy for ourselves. Eventually, we decided to build a product out of it, so that our clients could build VR experiences on their own.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"I think bootstrap is the best way to go when you're looking for a problem-solution fit. Once you have that angel financing you really zone in on the product-market fit. When you're ready to scale, go for VCs.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Coca-Cola and homemade chocolate with olives that power our team -- plus, being open-minded and listening to what clients tell us. If we need to change something, we will.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Build a bootstrapping source to make us less dependent on outside financing.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Not going into an accelerator program sooner.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"I don't personally know any of them, so it's hard to say. We value good people that give great advice at the right time.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"BBQ and beer.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Define what's the person's future development trajectory.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Follow the money.\" Editor's note: GeekWire is featuring each of the startups in 9Mile Labs' fall cohort.

      "content": "Parag Garg, Wally Labs chief technology officer and chief product officer, and vice president of Sears Holdings; and Ryan Ciovacco, Sears president of Connected Living and WallyHome, with the new WallyHome Starter Kit in the company's engineering office in Seattle's University District. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop)\n One of the people who sometimes jumps into the Slack channel for the Seattle-based WallyHome sensor company is a colleague named Eddie -- offering support and guidance from his office in the Miami area. That would be Edward S. Lampert, CEO of Sears Holdings Corp., which acquired WallyHome a year ago. Lampert sees WallyHome and the Internet of Things \"as a big opportunity,\" said Ryan Ciovacco, Sears president of Connected Living and WallyHome, in an interview this week. \"He's given us a lot of autonomy to do what we need to do. Obviously he gives guidance, but he has allowed us to do a lot, and the rest of the company has followed suit in supporting us.\" With that support from the top, WallyHome has grown rapidly -- now employing about 60 people, up from six when the retail giant acquired the WallyHome sensor technology from Seattle startup SNUPI Technologies, a University of Washington spinoff company, in October 2015. The big bet by Sears on WallyHome is especially notable and potentially significant given the current struggles of some of the company's traditional retail brands. The existing WallyHome technology detects water leaks and alerts homeowners and building managers to problems caused by changes in moisture, temperature and humidity. But the company is working to expand the capabilities of the WallyHome system well beyond water and moisture. In the future, executives say, the base station will work with a variety of connected devices and sensors, from WallyHome and other companies. As an initial step, WallyHome just released its first new product since the Sears acquisition: a WallyHome Starter Kit with a redesigned base station and sensor for $100. Individual sensors cost $35. That's a major departure from the pricing strategy for WallyHome under SNUPI, which sold a base station and six sensors for about $300. New features of the system include the ability to detect open doors and windows. Other new features include a digital speaker in the base station for leak notifications, and a battery backup in the WallyHome hub in case the power goes out. The sensors also include a local alarm, supplementing the text messages, mobile notifications from the WallyHome app, and automated phone calls that users can receive when the system detects something wrong. The new base station uses industry standard connected-home radios, and \"over time, it will become compatible with more and more connected home products,\" said Parag Garg, Wally Labs chief technology officer and chief product officer, and vice president of Sears Holdings. \"This is the shot across the bow,\" Garg said. \"This is our start. But there's definitely a lot more that we're doing. We're being thoughtful about how we're doing it. It's not, for us, about demonstrating 50 compatibilities that customers may not find interesting right away. It's about making sure that we're solving for specific pain points and thinking those through.\" In addition, the company is testing a possible paid service that would offer WallyHome users live assistance via phone, allowing a customer service agent to guide a user through the process of shutting off the water or otherwise mitigating a leak or other problem in the home. The agent could also dispatch a technician or contractor via Sears Home Services to fix the problem. WallyHome is also working on integrations with some Sears home appliances, leveraging another of the company's traditional product lines. \"We want to own the health of the home,\" Ciovacco said. \"The overall vision is really a full solution.\" In pursuing its connected-home services strategy, Sears is competing against a wide variety of existing players, ranging from tech giants such as Amazon to startups and device manufacturers. Ciovacco and Garg both worked previously at Amazon, among other companies. Sears Home Services also established an engineering center in downtown Seattle last year. WallyHome traces its roots to technology developed inside the University of Washington by professor Shwetak Patel. It spun out of the UW under the corporate umbrella of SNUPI Technologies, led by veteran entrepreneur Jeremy Jaech. Prior to the Sears acquisition of WallyHome, SNUPI laid off a significant portion of its staff and shelved the Wally sensors after it was unable to raise additional venture funding. Under Sears, the company has been able to rehire some of those former SNUPI employees in its Seattle office, next to the University of Washington campus, where the bulk of the WallyHome team now works. WallyHome also has employees at Sears headquarters in Hoffman Estates, Ill., in downtown Chicago, and in India and Asia. The company also maintains ties to the UW through internships and other initiatives. ",

Madrona Venture Group photo.\n CloudCoreo, a Seattle-based startup in the cloud-management arena, has received a $2.9 million seed-stage investment led by Seattle's Madrona Venture Group, with participation from Divergent Ventures, Aristos Ventures and Data Collective. The company will use the funds to help with product development and is recruiting software and DevOps engineers. Soma Somasegar, a venture partner at Madrona and former Microsoft executive, will join the company's board of directors. CloudCoreo's sparse website says only that it is \"working on a next-generation cloud-management platform . . . to enable DevOps and SecOps teams to scale efficiently within and across cloud providers.\" CEO Tom Hull yesterday declined to provide further details, saying only that \"we're huge believers in the public cloud, and as enterprise moves more apps there, there's a need for automation to help with the entire infrastructure.\" He acknowledged that \"there are a host of management platforms out there\" but wouldn't compare CloudCoreo's offering to competitors. The company is set to debut its first product at re:Invent, Amazon Web Services' conference being held November 28 through December 2 in Las Vegas. CloudCoreo has received a total of $2.9 million to date and has a staff of about 10 people, Hull said. The name is short for \"cloud choreography.\" A bit more can be gleaned from the company's sole job posting, which seeks a back-end developer who is skilled in Ruby or GO on Linux, has worked with containers and AWS and wants to \"help enterprises moving to the cloud avoid downtime and attacks.\" It adds, \"The DevOps process is challenging to implement well. CloudCoreo fixes DevOps.\" The company was founded by industry cloud veterans and serial entrepreneurs Hull, Jason Needham (CMO) and Paul Allen (CTO). Hull and Needham previously founded Union Bay Networks, a cloud networking and security company, which was acquired by Apple. \"As the cloud infrastructure world embraces micro-services and containers to build and deploy at-scale distributed services, a comprehensive devops solution that enables companies to automate and secure the entire cloud operation across multiple cloud and hybrid cloud environments is a must-have solution,\" wrote Somaseagar in a blog post. \"CloudCoreo is doing just that and has already proven itself to be an invaluable product for many of its early customers.\" Prior to Union Bay, Hull and Needham were senior executives at Seattle's F5 Networks, whose BIG-IP product line powers some large enterprise data centers. Hull in particular has a long history with Madrona, having worked with Madrona-backed companies Visio and Impinj as well as Union Bay. Allen has worked in DevOps for over eight years. Before co-founding CloudCoreo, Allen led the early adoption of AWS at companies including Convio and Blackbaud. Updated to reflect accurate amount received. ",

Seattle-based iJet Technologies reeled in $24.7 million, according to a new SEC filing. The funding is not listed as \"equity,\" but rather categorized as \"other,\" with this description: \"Sale and issuance of preferred equity in exchange for the cancellation of certain debt obligations.\" iJet Technologies CEO John Schramm declined to comment on the investment. Founded in 2010, iJet Technologies helps airline companies with a cross-functional data management and analytics platform. Its products and services intend to replace traditional hardware and custom software development with an open platform that reduces the need to create individual solutions that require their own proprietary avionics system. \"With the aviation connectivity market growing at double-digit rates, airplanes are increasingly connected via IP communication links to airline's operations and maintenance control centers,\" the company's website notes. \"Connected airplanes enable a new era of intelligent aircraft providing enterprises with a quantum leap in situational awareness and operational efficiency through streaming and integrated data.\" iJet has three product categories: iJet Airborne, iJet Ground, and iJet Maintenance. \"These application and analytic products use real-time data from the onboard platform, historical data from the ground platform, integrated airline and third party data in appropriate combinations, then add business logic and analytic algorithms to deliver on iJet's vision of innovation,\" the website notes. Schramm was a pilot for Delta Airlines for nearly two decades before becoming COO at iJet in August 2014. Other executives include CTO Link Jaw, the founder of Scientific Monitoring Inc. and former chief analytics architect for Intel's IoT group; VP of Software Engineering and Operations Jessica Rosch, a former engineer for Harris Corporation and Disney who joined iJet in 2013; and Senior Director of Aviation and Technology Paul Mallasch, who joined the company in 2011 after spending nearly a decade consulting for Tectura. The company has 18 employees listed on LinkedIn. Hemjo Klein is chairman of the board. Klein, appointed as chairman in January 2015, was previously CEO of Lufthansa Airlines' Passenger Division and sat on Lufthansa Group's executive board after spending more than a decade in managerial roles with the Germany-based airline giant. He was also previously a board member at Deutsche Bahn, Germany's national railway organization.

      "content": "Panelists at the Pioneer Square Labs one-year anniversary event in Seattle. From left to right: Aaron Easterly, Sarah Bird, Scott Moore, Robert Schulte, Dan Shapiro and moderator Brad Feld.\n If you could pick anyplace to build your company -- except for Seattle, of course -- where would it be? That was the question posed today to a group of five Seattle entrepreneurs who participated in a panel discussion as part of an event hosted by Pioneer Square Labs, the startup studio based in Seattle. Interestingly, three of the five entrepreneurs picked places outside of the U.S. Here's what they each had to say: --Aaron Easterly, the CEO of online pet sitting marketplace Rover, picked Portland or Sydney, Australia. The reason for Portland is that it is a tech community that is \"just weird enough to give you the benefit of the doubt\" on a crazy concept like Rover. Easterly, a former aQuantive executive, said he'd steer clear of San Francisco because it's really \"difficult to hire in the Valley.\" As to Sydney, Easterly said the Rover business is driven by the concept of \"dog as child\" and he said that mentality is very much alive in Australia. --Robert Schulte, CEO of Pioneer Square Labs spin out LumaTax, said he'd go to Austin, in part because it was his second choice to Seattle when the former senior sales tax auditor with the state of California was looking to start a new company. He said Austin has a great ecosystem and a great university. \"Anywhere but California, honestly,\" he said to laughs. --Dan Shapiro, CEO of 3D laser printer maker Glowforge, offered a little bit of a curve ball with his answer, saying he'd pick Shenzhen. But he also requested that he'd be able to change his city of birth to the Chinese city as well. \"What I would want to do is found the company in Shenzhen and be native born there, and U.S. educated because we are taking people from a culture that has an amazing industrial infrastructure and incredible manufacturing expertise -- bringing them here, educating them and giving them all of our know how ... -- and then sending them back into an environment where it is far faster and easier to create hardware-based companies and create the hardware itself, than in many cases it is here, because the ecosystem is so incredibly agile there for producing hardware.\" --Sarah Bird, CEO of online marketing company Moz, initially picked New York City because of its high concentration of advertising businesses. But then Bird said she couldn't imagine living there long term, so she changed her answer to Ireland because she likes the beer, the accents and the weather. --Scott Moore, former CEO of Cheezburger who is now running a Pioneer Square Labs spin out, also thought New York could be a good fit given the ability to target customers in the advertising arena. But he also mentioned Tel Aviv, in part because it is an \"incredibly dynamic startup scene\" with a phenomenal talent pool. Moderator Brad Feld -- a venture capitalist at Foundry Group and co-founder of TechStars who resides in Boulder, Colorado -- concluded the topic with a joke that he asked the question because he's really just scouting for the next TechStars location. Earlier in the panel, Feld asked each of the entrepreneurs what is missing in Seattle's startup ecosystem, asking them what you'd put on \"the sucky list\" about Seattle. Shapiro, who previously founded Ontela and Sparkbuy, immediately grabbed the microphone and surmised that everyone would say angel financing. \"In Seattle, I think angels are much more provincial,\" he said. \"You have fewer professional angels who are looking to find the next deal, and more people who are investing in their network and fewer angels.\" Shapiro concluded by saying that\"it is just brutal as a first-time entrepreneur without a network getting financings done in Seattle. \"The early-stage here is just really rough,\" he said. Schulte, a transplant from California, countered that opinion and noted that the tax infrastructure in California is just \"crippling.\" He added that he didn't find as much difficulty in Seattle fundraising, noting that the early-stage round for LumaTax was among the easiest in his career. \"I deliberately moved to Seattle because of the ecosystem up here,\" said Schulte, adding that if there is a weakness at all to Seattle it is the lack of younger entrepreneurs. (A topic I addressed as a moderator of an earlier panel with four venture capitalists). ",

Photo by Dan DeLong for GeekWire\n While Washington state's biotech industry is on the up and up, it still lags far behind hubs like San Francisco and Cambridge, Mass. Washington's biotech industry is not only lagging behind, it is actually regressing, said Hans Bishop, CEO of Seattle-based Juno Therapeutics, a biotech company focused on developing cancer immunotherapies. Speaking at the GeekWire Summit 2016, Bishop said that if the area wants to catch up, the key is encouraging more biotech companies to open up shop in the state. Bishop pointed out that the state's industry was growing a decade ago, increasing market share and producing innovative ideas and patents. \"And now we're going backwards,\" Bishop said, citing issues like the expiration of state tax credits for companies with extensive R&D efforts, along with a lack of wet lab space in the state, which he said is \"as rare as hen's teeth.\" \"For me, success is all about more companies starting here,\" Bishop said. \"It's a blend of financial incentives, operating space, and encouraging universities to keep spinning out companies and keep those companies in the state.\" Bishop said biotech startups typically operate at a loss for years before seeing profits from their extensively researched products. During that initial period of loss, many states give these R&D heavy firms tax credits, but Washington state's tax credit program expired in 2014. \"We've got a lot to do, but I think the work is starting and I believe there is real intent, and I hope we can get ourselves back on track,\" Bishop said. Juno Therapeutics spun out of Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in 2013 and completed a successful IPO a year later. ",

Hsieh shared his ambitions with Simon Yu, another UW grad and the owner of the food truck. Yu was excited about the project and soon the two weren't just serving up Korean-Mexican fare. They began building BitMaker, an app that allows users to earn bitcoins by testing games and apps. \"It allows businesses to acquire new customers in a cost-efficient way,\" said Yu, who now serves as CEO of CakeCodes. We caught up with Yu for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"BitMaker is a mobile app granting free Bitcoins to users for trying new games and apps, this drives cost-effective new traffic to app publishers.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"We realized how expensive it was to advertise our app on Google and how low the conversion rate was. As a result, we came up with a way to have users get free money by playing games and trying new apps. App publishers only pay after a user has tried out their app and completed an objective in the game, which results in much higher conversion rates than the traditional advertising method.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Bootstrap and customer revenue. We've been generating revenue from day one because our core business model works with working with advertisers. Bootstrapping has been great for us as we were able to freely pivot our ideas and business model until we found a correct solution.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Gamification. At the end of the day, we help app publishers advertise their product to the users. However, advertising is extremely annoying. Everyone on our team hates ads. They're everywhere. But the question we ask ourselves every day is, 'How can we make ads not suck? What if it's actually fun to engage with ads?' I think it also helps us a lot that our team is primarily made up of millennials and we understand how short the attention span of an everyday user is. We continue to gamify our app every day so it just becomes a real-life quest, users can use to play games and receive real rewards -- kind of how people would play World of Warcraft but receive real money for completing a quest with us.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Participating in 9Mile Labs. It's just a great program. The three founders Sanjay, Kevin, and Sandy are always there to help when we need them. They are extremely willing to help us whether it's getting intros to businesses who want to work with us, investors, or finding someone who might help us on a specific issue we have. We wouldn't have been able to progress as fast as we had without their help.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Not setting deadlines for certain tasks. It took us a while for us to start setting deadlines and we realized our progress happened much faster. Having the pressure to get a certain task done by a predetermined time allows you to progress much faster to the next goal.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Zuckerberg. He really understands his users, this is why Facebook has over a billion users. He gives what people want and that's why he has built this amazing product. He inspires us because he teaches us how to build a product based on what the user wants.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Ping Pong. It's such a fun sport and a great way for us to take a break from our laptops and get our blood pumping.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Someone who likes to learn and grow. Technology is always advancing and there's always new ways to optimize technology more efficiently. We love someone who is willing to think of new ways constantly to make things better. It's an awesome skillset we all have on our team and look for when we add a teammate.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Have a great team. Your original idea is most likely going to pivot many times before you find the right product. A strong team will allow you to steer you out to a great product regardless of how many things go wrong in the company.

Photo: Limitless.\n Animating in virtual reality may be fun, but it is an undeniable challenge for even experienced animators, and often the process can be time-consuming as animators dash between the VR environment they are creating and the computer software they use to create it. Limitless, a Bellevue, Wash.-based virtual reality startup, hopes to reduce the hassle of animating in VR with a new animation toolset for creating VR characters in real time, in a VR environment, with no special training necessary. Limitless Founder and CEO Tom Sanocki, a veteran of both Pixar and game studio Bungie, said in a news release that creating characters is the biggest need the current development of VR. \"Forming a deep emotional connection with the characters we care about hits the core of mainstream entertainment,\" Sanocki said. \"Our platform solves the tricky task of creating interactive characters in VR, and now makes it easy for anyone to animate those characters in real time.\" Using the new toolset, users can animate a character in a previously created VR environment, using VR equipment to interact with the characters and animate them in real time. Check out this video to see the tech in action:  The tools will be released to a small group of studios and partners for a dry run this month, with a wider launch anticipated in the future. Sanocki founded Limitless in April of 2015, with the goal of making VR characters more lifelike and engaging. Limitless debuted its initial technology, which creates more VR characters, earlier this year. \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Shutterstock.\n There is a regionalization movement underway in the technology startup industry that has appropriately sparked controversy and strong opinions, most recently between Peter Thiel and Steve Case. Thiel argued that Silicon Valley and New York City are the only two options for aspiring tech entrepreneurs. Case offered a counter view that new centers of innovation are forming outside of those markets, coining the phrase, \"the rise of the rest.\" Whether thriving tech ecosystems could flourish outside the Valley is the very question that inspired me to leave the world's most famous hub of innovation five years ago to run an experiment and build an early-stage venture fund in Oregon. Five years ago, the idea of the rise of the rest was not widely accepted in the inner circles of Silicon Valley and the venture capital industry. In fact, of the dozen fellow VC friends I talked to about my idea for launching a fund in Oregon, most were skeptical and worried about finding enough \"venture scalable\" startups outside the Valley. When I began speaking to entrepreneurs, however, I heard a very different story. They talked about the excessive cost structure in the Valley, the fierce competition for hiring talent, the pressure placed on them by their investors to get to hypergrowth and scale or die trying. Although this hypergrowth playbook is required of some startups in certain market segments where business sustainability isn't reached until network effects at scale are achieved, a more rational path to scale can be pursued and is actually preferred for many startups. So, five years ago I set out to understand the underlying foundational elements that comprise a thriving regional tech ecosystem, talking to many people who blazed the trail before me. I learned that it all came down to four common pillars: Regional markets with these conditions are appearing throughout the U.S. in places like Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City, Austin, Phoenix, and Las Vegas. Successful Silicon Valley venture capitalist Mark Kvamme left Sequoia Capital for Columbus Ohio to launch Drive Capital and has found similar compelling characteristics in communities throughout the Midwest. And in his trek across the country, Steve Case also has found the same in dozens of communities. In recent years, the Northwest has produced category-leading companies like Tableau, Jive, DocuSign, Zillow, and Zulily...to name a few. So the question transitioned from whether large consequential businesses of scale could be built in regional markets to whether this is a short-term trend or a fundamental shift. Of course, I knew this same thing had been attempted many times in the past to varying degrees of success. So, why would it be different this time around? The single most important underlying reason ties to technology and capital. In the 80's, 90's, and the first part of the 2000's the major technology waves included heavy doses of networking equipment, hardware, and semiconductor products, which were very capital-intensive, often requiring $30 to $40 million of investor capital to deliver a working product to customers. Even the software companies of that era took north of $10 million in investor capital to build a go-to-market product, acquire an initial group of customers and essentially prove that they had a viable business. Because of the cloud, open source dev tools, and other technology advances, the cost of building an early go-to-market product plummeted as did the amount of capital needed to fund that phase of the startup's life. These companies will need to raise much more capital to scale, but again that will be much easier when they have ramping revenues and real customers. Over the past decade, software companies have been disrupting one industry after another at an accelerating rate, becoming the fastest and most capital-efficient path to value creation and have come to dominate the startup landscape. This bodes well for startups in Silicon Valley, and even more so for startups in regional markets where historically significant capital gaps have existed. With today's capital-efficient startup, an entrepreneur can build a product and find early customer traction often utilizing less than $1 million in investor capital, an order of magnitude drop from the early 2000's. This has resulted in a more granular, higher velocity of business formation, adaption to market needs, and growth. So why will the current regionalization movement stick this time? Sure, a rising tide lifts all ships and the past decade has been an incredible one in the technology industry, especially in software. However, several events have transpired to make regionalization the new norm rather than a cyclical trend. First, the global economic meltdown of 2008 caused many tech workers to move out of Silicon in search of less costly communities. Those people eventually started or joined new companies. Those companies, communities, and regions have had the better part of a decade to grow and mature; and many of them are now producing big winning tech businesses that any entrepreneur or investor in Silicon Valley would be proud to be part of. The length of the current cycle has also allowed another important phenomenon to develop - one I like to call the \"Recycling Effect.\" As startups launch, grow, scale, and exit, the talent eventually spins out and joins or launches new startups in the community, resulting in the recycling of talent. Similarly, the wealth that was generated by the startup recycles as well. Those who prospered most - typically founders, management team and investors - put that money right back to work. The recycling of talent and wealth into wave after wave of startups is the magic of Silicon Valley and it is now happening outside the Valley. This results in more thriving economies and more tax revenue in those regions, creating an almost viral loop of prosperity within the community. The biggest difference during this regionalization is the recycling effect has been kicked into high-gear in many communities across the nation. The Silicon Valley model led us to this self-generating prosperity engine. We should all be very thankful that the model does work in other regions and communities; otherwise, the economic future of the nation would be dire. ",

      "content": "Tahmina Watson, immigration attorney and author of \"The Startup Visa: Key to Job Growth and Economic Prosperity in America\"\n Startup entrepreneur Henry Chen faces the same obstacles as many other fresh college graduates in his position -- building a product, getting users, landing investors, and launching a business a world away from family. But for Chen, those ordinary challenges are just the start. A native of Hefei, China, he came to the U.S. on a visa, and he has between one and 24 months to work on his startups in the U.S., depending on a verdict from Immigration Services. After graduating from the University of Missouri in 2015, Chen received Optional Practical Training (OTP) parole -- a 12-month extension of the F-1 visa that he used to attend college. His OTP expired in June and he'll have to return to China if his request for another extension isn't granted. Fortunately for Chen, the Department of Homeland Security, under a directive from the White House, has proposed a new \"entrepreneur rule\" that grants a two- to five-year \"parole\" -- the term of art in the immigration process -- to encourage immigrants to build startups in the U.S. \"It will give me one better option to continue my business in the U.S., one of the top notch countries for startups,\" said Chen. Chen is the founder of two startups. He launched Toss Rock Inc. in 2015 to build an app for real estate agents showing homes to remote, long-distance buyers. In April, he founded Rubix Mind, a mobile game company, with a friend. Chen plans to apply for the entrepreneur parole, sometimes referred to as a \"startup visa,\" if he qualifies. That's a big if. To be considered, startups need to raise at least $345,000 from \"qualified\" U.S. investors or $100,000 in government grants. Startups have to be founded in the U.S. within the last three years. Founders must own at least 15 percent of the company, and demonstrate the company's growth potential and \"significant public benefit to the United States.\" If granted parole, immigrants can stay in the country for two years while they build their startups. During that period, they must maintain an income at least four times higher than the federal poverty line. After the initial two years, a founder can apply for three more years in the U.S. if the startup has raised an additional $500,000, created 10 full-time jobs, or reached $500,000 in revenue. As of now, the \"startup visa\" is just a proposed rule, open to public comment until Oct. 17. Some experts like Tahmina Watson, an immigration attorney and author of The Startup Visa: Key to Job Growth and Economic Prosperity in America, argue the requirements to qualify for parole are too restrictive. \"In my comments, my top three requests will be to lower the following: First, lower the initial qualified investment from $345,000 to $250,000,\" she said. \"Second, lower the household income from 400 percent above federal poverty guidelines to no more than 200 percent. And lastly, at the time of the renewal, lower the job creation number from 10 to 5.\" The financing requirements are the biggest obstacle Chen faces. \"There is one thing I am struggling with,\" he said. \"I may receive capital from VCs in China, but that may not fit in this picture, and may bring more complications into my case. I understand how this rule may prevent money laundering and other scams, but on the other hand, it restricts foreign entrepreneurs' freedom in business here.\" Because immigration reform failed in Congress, the White House had to exercise its authority with Homeland Security in order to create an option for entrepreneurs. The rule grants parole status to qualified startup founders, but it isn't a visa. The temporary and mutable nature of that status could present other challenges for entrepreneurs trying to meet the funding requirements. \"The individual is not being granted any kind of status, but they are just being granted an admission to the U.S. that can be revoked at any time as a matter of discretion by DHS,\" said immigration attorney Ian Wagreich. \"This doesn't provide very much comfort to the individuals who might be 'qualified investors' seeking to invest in a stable U.S. business, or to the applicant for the parole status. Why would an investor be interested in funding an investment for the applicant's benefit if the applicant is going to be granted such a tenuous benefit that can be revoked at any time?\" Atul Khekade thinks the investment parameters are appropriate for foreign entrepreneurs. He is the founder of Airnetz, a technology-focused travel platform that operates Airnetz Charter (think Uber for helicopters and jets). \"Raising $100,000 and hiring two American workers is somewhat feasible,\" he said. \"Until now, we have always generated a sizable employment in the U.S. and will continue to do so after raising capital. For me or for emerging entrepreneurs in general, what we need the most is flexibility and support.\" But Khekade faces other barriers. Though his company has entities registered in the U.S., it is headquartered in India. This may disqualify him from the startup parole proposed by the DHS. He says Airnetz is \"undergoing some changes in our corporate structure and we may be refiling our entity in the U.S. under a different category.\" Khekade and his co-founder are interested in applying for the startup parole option. U.S. citizenship is attractive to business professionals for a number of reasons, but as entrepreneurs, they don't fall into any clear work visa category. \"They are either for employees (H1/L1) or for someone with outstanding performance or achievement (like EB1 for Nobel Prize winner or a businessman who is already successful and earned a lot of money). Or there is EB5 which requires you to invest $1 million yourself,\" he said. \"I was interested in the entrepreneur-friendly visa for the U.S.\" The executive branch doesn't have the authority to create a true visa for entrepreneurs and there isn't a definitive step for founders when the parole period ends. \"Limiting one's period of stay to two or five years without the possibility to extend the visa or make available other visas is shortsighted,\" said Reaz Jafri, Head of Immigration at the Withers Bergman law firm. \"Assuming a company is successful - profitable, created jobs -- shouldn't its founders be allowed to remain in the U.S. permanently if they want? If not, are we incentivizing them to take their business elsewhere?\" But, as Watson notes, the DHS expects successful entrepreneurs to qualify for other options by the end of their parole period. In other words, build a profitable business first, worry about a visa later. \"It is hoped that the startup entity will be successful enough to support a different non-immigrant or immigrant visa category at the end of his/her parole period,\" she said. \"In addition, the administration will release new policy updates on the immigrant visa category 'national interest waiver'. The new policy guidance may provide an option of permanent residency in the U.S for entrepreneurs who continue to bring economic benefits to America by creating jobs and generating revenue. I expect to see developments in the next few months.\" In the meantime, Chen continues working on his startups, meeting with venture capitalists, and seeking grants, while he waits to hear back from Immigration Services. \"If there is no luck to maintain my immigration status at some time, yes, I will move my projects somewhere else,\" he said. \"Could be Hefei, or Shanghai, or anywhere in the world with open doors. No big deal, I am not picky on locations.\" ",

      "content": "Brian McAndrews.\n The evolving picture of Brian McAndrews' tech career is taking a new turn as Seattle-based PicMonkey, the photo editing and graphic design platform, announced Wednesday that it has added the ex-Pandora and aQuantive CEO to its board of directors. PicMonkey has been riding a wave of rapid growth. The startup landed a $41 million investment from Spectrum Equity a year ago. It also brought in top executive talent in COO Brent Chudoba, from SurveyMonkey, and CTO Frits Habermann, founder of Adobe InDesign. All of that was attractive to McAndrews. \"To me it really comes down to: Do you believe in the product? Is it a great opportunity? And how do you feel about the people?\" McAndrews said. \"And I was able to check all three of those boxes really positively here.\" McAndrews, who spent just over 2 1/2 years as CEO of the music streaming service Pandora, called PicMonkey a great product and a growing business. \"Digital photos is huge and a growing opportunity,\" McAndrews said. \"Three billion photos are uploaded from people's phones every day and they're increasingly being shared and used in professional as well as personal settings. It's still the early days and PicMonkey is making inroads with everyday users but also people in more of a professional setting in companies. Digital content continues to explode and PicMonkey is at the cutting edge of that trend.\" CEO Jonathan Sposato said McAndrews is joining at a critical time in the trajectory of PicMonkey as the company creates what he calls \"the future of visual expression for hobbyists and professionals alike.\" \"His deep roots with digital media, advertising and technology and his experience operating and scaling impressive subscription and technology businesses will be invaluable in continuing PicMonkey's leadership in the photo editing and design space,\" Sposato said. McAndrews was the president and CEO of aQuantive from 1999-2007, and stayed for a year after the online advertising company was acquired by Microsoft for $6.3 billion. He has also held executive positions at the Walt Disney Company, ABC and General Mills. And he currently serves as chairman of the board of GrubHub as well as chair of the Technology and Innovation Committee on board of The New York Times. The Pacific Northwest made sense after leaving Pandora, and McAndrews said he even kept his house in Seattle. \"I always saw my time in the Bay Area as being limited,\" McAndrews said. \"I was basically going down there for the opportunity but always expected to come back. I love Seattle and think it's a great, vibrant area economically.\" He's impressed by the continued growth taking place in the city's tech sector and sees a big positive in the way the ecosystem kind of feeds on itself. \"Amazon has just exploded and continues to grow significantly,\" McAndrews said. \"You see more and more companies from the Bay Area putting satellite offices up here, recognizing there's a tremendous amount of engineering and other tech talent here. And I think as a result, more people who come here for those companies, in many cases, then have the opportunity to launch their own thing.\" McAndrews is keenly aware of the aQuantive DNA that runs through parts of the Seattle scene, as he cites companies such as Rover and Placed -- both run by former aQuantive executives. \"There have been a number of people from aQuantive who have either spent time at Microsoft and then went on and started other companies or are sitting on boards of other companies or are running early stage companies,\" McAndrews said. \"One thing about Seattle I have heard from recruiters, that it's one of the hardest places to recruit people out of. Once people come into Seattle they don't want to leave, because they like the lifestyle. That is a real positive in terms of our ability to grow the ecosystem.\" Whether or not he'll get the bug again to lead another company as CEO or launch a startup of his own, McAndrews said for now he's interested in being a mentor or advisor and getting involved with boards. \"I want to take the experience that I've gotten over the last 30 or so years in my career and really help share that with people,\" McAndrews said. \"Never say never regarding any future plans, but right now that's kind of where my focus is. \"I will hint this: You'll be hearing of some other boards that I'm joining in Seattle as well.\" Editor's note: PicMonkey CEO Jonathan Sposato is GeekWire's investor and chairman.

Qualified developers rarely seemed to make it through the recruiting process. He teamed up with sales and marketing professionals Kelvin Chen and Matt Gu to brainstorm startup ideas that would take some of the pain out of hiring tech talent. They experimented with several concepts and interviewed dozens of companies before discovering the root of the problem. Recruiters don't have the technical background necessary to vet qualified developer candidates. \"The solution immediately became clear at that point: A software that is capable of connecting the dots, removing bias, looking beyond resumes and providing actionable insights,\" said Chen. \"Most importantly, it needed to perform all of these at high speed.\" That was the genesis of Talentful, a software platform that uses machine learning to help recruiters quickly and efficiently vet technology candidates. Chen told GeekWire about his entrepreneurial journey for this installment of Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"Recruiters post job openings and get flooded with resumes. Our software helps them identify the best candidates.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"Our first product, an interview service, fell into the abyss when we realized technology companies' most painful problem wasn't interviewing but fulfilling the beginning of their recruiting pipeline with qualified developer candidates. Since technology is constantly evolving and most recruiters don't have strong technical backgrounds, qualified developers are often overlooked. We also noticed that recruiters spent a significant amount of their time browsing social platforms such as Github and Twitter to get a deeper understanding of candidates, but weren't able to fully comprehend the information found. We concluded that we could automate a great portion of the work processes to help them become more accurate and efficient in their screening process.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"We have been bootstrapping for a year. Recently, we received an investment from the 9Mile Labs Accelerator and credits from Google, Amazon and Microsoft, which has been tremendously helpful. We're currently exploring a variety of options to support team growth and customer growth.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Talentful uses machine learning to analyze lots of data points of a potential hire. We provide the most in-depth analysis on their skill sets, interests, and personality. As Talentful focuses on developers, we've built specialized tools that are custom to the tech talent segment. For example, our engine studies the characteristics of existing star employees to make more accurate hiring recommendations on candidates.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"I would have to say it was when we started early sales conversations with several prominent technology companies before we wrote too much code. This allowed us to work with them on validating pain points and build out product features that greatly addressed their needs.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"In the early days, we focused heavily on customer acquisition. After analyzing usage logs, we found a lot of churn resulting from customers who didn't understand how to use the tool right away. We realized that we needed to spend more time on-boarding our early adopters and setting metrics for customer success to make sure they had immediate success.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Definitely Bezos. Bezos is renowned for his hard-working style and futuristic vision. Don't get me wrong, the other two are super smart folks. But Bezos affects the people around him. On top of that, he sees the world differently as he believes in the big picture and big moves. He is not an incremental person because he's changed the world in a very radical way. He inspires us to have a big vision and always thrive to make things 100x better.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"Working together to prank other teams in our accelerator cohort. We scheme different scenarios and look out for each other while carrying out the execution. Our most recent prank war involved Photoshop with another startup. I ended up getting ahold of their CEO's driver's license photo and we all had a very fun time placing his face on lots of funny photos. Our entire cohort definitely had a good laugh. He ended up making my computer read Moby Dick via text-to-speech on the background as revenge.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Engagement. We love to see a person heavily engaged in their work. We look for open source projects on GitHub or a passion for learning new skills. It's always interesting to see how people solve problems and how they get excited when breaking down complex problems into smaller, actionable pieces.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Start selling the product as early as possible. The best way to tell that you are solving a pain point is when customers are willing to pay. It also provides you with the most honest way to get customer feedback.\" Editor's note: GeekWire is featuring each of the startups in 9Mile Labs' fall cohort.

SeatGeek uses Essential to alert fans of available seats to their favorite team's next game. Peach uses it to send messages alerting customers which restaurants it is delivering from on a given day. As it begins to branch out from Madrona Labs, Essential is in the middle of raising its first round of funding. Madrona Venture Group is an investor, but Fridgen would not say how much the company is putting in. Essential will use the money in part to build up its engineering team Essential is led by veterans of the local tech scene: CEO Mike McMurray, Vice President of Engineering Daniel Pirone and Vice President of Product Zoe Schagrin. McMurray has been a senior vice president at PointInside and general manager at RealNetworks. Pirone previously held senior engineer positions at at Madrona-backed Qumulo and Nuance Communications. Schagrin was previously a senior product manager at Amazon and a founder and CEO of an early-stage startup. Several Madrona Labs staffers will continue to work with Essential until the company fills out its engineering team. McMurray said in an interview with GeekWire that working with Madrona Labs helped Essential build a strong foundation for its products that will hold up as the company grows. McMurray said the company wants to help companies talk to their customers through a variety of platforms. \"If you are a brand trying to deal with both the complexity and nuance of interacting with customers on different channels -- whether it be SMS, or Facebook Messenger or Slack -- really understanding the difference and how you approach and communicate with customers in an honest and straight forward way is not an easy problem to solve,\" said McMurray. Formed in 2014, Madrona Venture Labs calls itself a \"startup studio,\" with a goal of helping spin out new startup ideas quickly, taking those ideas from \"napkin to traction.\" The firm has spun out two other companies after incubating the concepts: Spare5 and ReplyYes. The concept behind Madrona Venture Labs is similar to Pioneer Square Labs, a startup studio formed last year by Greg Gottesman, Mike Galgon, Ben Gilbert and Geoff Entress. Gottesman lead Madrona Labs in its early days, worked for a number of years as a partner at Madrona Venture Group, and now serves as a venture partner at the firm. ",

Damir Wallener got the idea for the company when he was running for mayor of North Cowichan in British Columbia, Canada. Instead of a career in politics, the campaign started him on an entrepreneurial journey. Wallener and co-founder Jeff Sember launched Adszio in 2015. Their team of four currently incubating in the 9Mile Labs startup accelerator in Seattle. \"Our breakthrough came when we built a software tool that helped a local progressive political candidate nearly triple their vote share in a state-level election,\" said Wallener. \"We allowed social marketing with a level of time and location precision that you just can't get using any of the typical tool flows.\" Adszio handles budgets, scheduling, and other logistics involved with advertising on social media platforms and websites.

It was horrible -- the tools are complicated and you never really know what works, or what you should too. Too many webforms, too many clicks, too much jargon. Then a friend of mine also ran for political office and had the same problem. So we built a little tool that allowed him to go from photo op to full blown social advertising in as little as eight seconds -- all he had to do was email the photo and some text to a server we threw up on AWS.

(Via Wrench)\n Wrench, the on-site car repair startup, serviced more than 1,000 vehicles during a test run this summer in Seattle and that success has the company ready to hit the road as part of an expansion plan. The company announced this morning that it will expand its service throughout the greater Seattle-Tacoma-Everett metro area, with an eye toward other western metro areas, starting with Phoenix this fall. Wrench, which raised $1.2 million in seed funding from Madrona Venture Group in June, was co-founded by Ed Peterson. It allows users to schedule service online or via their app, with upfront fixed price quotes. A certified mechanic will perform work at a customer's home or office on all makes of cars and trucks. \"We learned from research that as many as 90 percent of car owners felt inconvenienced by their periodic trips to franchise shops and dealerships for car maintenance service,\" Peterson said in a news release. \"Our launch results confirmed the ready demand for a new approach. What surprised us was the amount of business particularly given the limited marketing investment we made.\" The company said it initially limited its services to oil changes, tune-ups and basic brake repair, but high demand led Wrench to expand services to cover almost anything that a shop or dealership would provide. \"As an investor, the Wrench team has what we look for in early stage funding -- a great team, a big idea, and a big market,\" Madrona managing director Len Jordan said in June.

Photo: Shawn Whiting, Pluto VR.\n Seattle is poised to be a leader in new virtual and augmented reality tech, with powerhouses like Oculus setting up shop in the city, not to mention a vibrant and growing VR community. This past weekend, 30 teams of VR enthusiasts put their ideas to the test at Seattle's fourth VR Hackathon, a two-day event held twice a year, designed to make ideas for VR games and applications into realities. The event was the largest VR Hackathon yet in Seattle, with more than 180 people registered and almost 500 visitors to the project demo fair that closed the weekend. \"We run it specifically because we want to help people learn, build out the community and help people network, and because we want to have fun,\" said one event organizer, Trond Nilsen. Although there were seven prizes up for grabs, Nilsen said community is a huge focus of the event, and teams are encouraged to work and learn together instead of competing. Teams often spend the full 48 hours in the hackathon location, crashing on floors, sharing tips, and staying up to the wee hours to perfect their projects, he said. While some teams are participating for fun, others may go on to develop these projects into full-fledged startups. Seattle's Invrse, a VR game studio, developed their flagship release Nest at a VR hackathon this spring. At he weekend's event, members of that team came together to embark on a new game, \"Witness Me!\", a Max Max / Guitar Hero crossover that took the prize for best sound. The weekend's projects featured ideas everywhere on the spectrum from a cat-herding game to applications for first responders in natural disaster zones, and much more. For those who didn't make it to the demo day, some of the projects will also be on display at the Seattle VR meetup this Thursday, and some will be exhibited at the Bellevue, Wash., Immerse Technology Summit in October. Read more about the hackathon winners below, as described by each team: Humanitarian Assistance Prize: The Disasters \"DisastARcons allows responders using Microsoft HoloLens to assess damage as needing to be addressed for safety concerns, and to triage sites affected after an emergency event by visually inspecting and marking areas that need attention, or that are health/safety risks. This information is synced via the cloud to the Incident Command System that will use these data points to decide and lead deployment of skilled teams to the area. Subsequent responders will use DisastARcons to find and resolve areas which were tagged by earlier teams in a more efficient manner than conventional methods.\" Best Physical Interfaces: Lee & Sean \"I mocked up a concept where after a natural disaster a rover could be deployed to explore collapsed buildings too dangerous for people to enter. A camera on the rover relays a video feed to the Vive headset and turns naturally with the user's gaze. The rover has a mechanical arm to grip and move building rubble out of the way, it has a spotlight to illuminate an area, all controlled from an old school arcade like control scheme.\" Community Choice: Team Red Line \"Ride a motorcycle using the Vive, trying to avoid traffic. Use the right hand to control the bike. Use the left hand to shoot the things.\" Best Tech Team: Team Waadel - Project \"Pop Rocks\" \"All the things in pop rocks, we figured it out. Come along for a musical journey in our fantasy land. Stay for a while and make a friend!\" Best Sound: Witness Me! \"Mad Max meets Guitar Hero. We have hopefully created a unique method where you can use a computer keyboard to create EPIC music while destroying your enemies in VR. Witness Me!\" Best Story: Yellow King \"Puzzle horror game with story telling, lots of interaction, light combat.\" Best Visuals: Down the Rabbit Hole \"Down the Rabbit Hole is a virtual reality experience that blurs the line between the digital world and the world around us. DTRH seeks to elicit different emotions and wonderment by presenting users with unique experiences that can only happen in VR.\" ",

      "content": "(Photo via Shutterstock).\n Foreign founders of seed-funded U.S. startups may soon have a viable U.S. visa option, filling a gaping hole in immigration policy. The Obama administration is seeking to act where Congress has failed to respond to the pressing realities of tech startups. Following through on a directive from President Obama, issued in Nov. 2014, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a proposed rule, called the \"International Entrepreneur Rule\", which would allow for founders of startup entities, backed by established U.S. investors, to apply for \"parole\" permission to remain in the U.S. for up to five years to grow their business. This is welcome news for the tech community, which has long been frustrated by the archaic visa system that does not allow most immigrant tech entrepreneurs to cleanly fit into any of the existing visa categories. Currently, startup founders who need U.S. visa status to work may not have any choice but to try to build the company outside the U.S., in either their home country or in a third country with a more entrepreneur-friendly immigration policy. This often presents a lose-lose situation for the U.S. and the entrepreneur, with the U.S. losing out on innovation and economic development and the entrepreneur missing out on access to funding and the deeply rooted tech startup communities that exist here. Under the new rule, accelerators like Techstars could both attract and keep foreign entrepreneurs in the region. Foreign national employees who want to leave Microsoft or Amazon to pursue their own ideas would have a pathway that could include significant ownership of the startup. Foreign students at University of Washington graduate programs would have options other than working for established companies. The Puget Sound region could benefit richly. How would a startup entrepreneur be able to get this new parole status? First, it requires the entrepreneur to have formed the startup in the past three years and own 15 percent or more of it. That startup has to have at least $345,000 in funding in the past year from active investors with a recent track record of investing in successful startups. If the startup does not have this type of funding, a government grant for startups totaling $100,000 may qualify the entrepreneur for the parole status. Suggesting some flexibility, the rule provides that entrepreneurs only partially meeting this level of funding can still apply for parole, with \"other reliable compelling evidence\" that the startup has the potential for rapid growth and job creation. An entrepreneur meeting these requirements would apply for parole with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, an agency within DHS, along with a processing fee of $1,200. If granted, the parole is good for two years initially, and can be extended for an additional three years if the startup has obtained additional funding of $500,000, created 10 full-time jobs, or reached $500,000 in revenue, averaging at least 20 percent annual growth. Again, alternative criteria are allowed if there is partial attainment of one of criteria. To maintain parole, the entrepreneur will be required to maintain an income of at least four times the Federal Poverty Guidelines for his or her household size (for a household of one, this would require annual income of $45,520 under the 2016 guidelines, with an additional $16,640 of income required for each additional household member). Startup founders who want to take advantage of this rule will need to be particularly selective with regard to investors. With the minimum investment amount needing to come from qualified investors with a track record, it will be even more important to seek out funding from established VCs and only experienced and active angel investors. In addition, founders should seek out opportunities for the DHS-suggested evidence to help their case for parole. This includes press coverage of the startup, participation in established accelerator programs, and similar documentation that the startup is engaged in the development of new technologies or cutting-edge research. Investors interested in startups founded by an international entrepreneur should be prepared with documentation proving the required track record of investments to make it a qualified investment for purposes of the rule. This can not only let the founder focus on growing the company without spending more time than necessary on visa issues, but may be an important tool to court new startups needing to obtain parole for a founder. Before we get too ahead of ourselves, the rule is only a proposed one. DHS is seeking comment on the proposed rule by Oct. 17, 2016. Comments may be submitted online here (note that all submissions will be posted publicly without change, so include personal information only if you want it made public). The tech community would benefit from its members submitting comments to DHS about the proposed rule, from investors and founders alike. In particular, DHS invites public comment on alternatives to the proposed investment amount and government funding thresholds that applicants may use to demonstrate a startup's substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation. Commenters are invited to submit comments on whether significant revenue generation, participation in established and reputable startup accelerators, or any other significant external validation factor should be included as a principal basis for seeking parole under this rule. Will this rule, if enacted in the current form, actually make a difference for immigrant entrepreneurs? In some cases, it could. Still, there are many practical issues to confront. Because this is not a Congressional enacted new visa category, but only the exercise of the President's discretionary \"parole authority,\" the entrepreneur's status is not permanent and will require finding another established visa category before the end of five years such as \"alien of extraordinary ability,\" \"national interest waiver,\" or sponsorship by a U.S. employer in which the foreign national does not have ownership interest. The timelines and potentially restrictive interpretations may also reduce its value in practice. Nevertheless, it is still welcome movement. Kohei Yamamoto and Steve Miller are immigration attorneys with Cowan Miller & Lederman in Seattle, where they represent companies of all sizes with employment-based visas and related matters. ",

There are no buttons -- users control music and answer phone calls by swiping gestures on the headphones themselves. The device, which holds 12 hours of battery life and comes with an induction charging station, turns off when the earphones magnetically come together, and turn on when they come apart.  The headphones also let users share audio from the same device with up to 20 individuals; block out or let in more noise in one's surrounding environment; and can turn into a loudspeaker by placing the earphones together. \"The future of audio is more than wireless headphones,\" Human co-founder Joe Dieter said in a statement. \"The industry has been playing it safe and only inching forward its consumer audio offerings.\" There is a one-day pre-order sale today for $170 per unit; the headphones will start at $200 during the crowdfunding campaign. They retail at $400 per unit. Wireless headphones have been around for a while, but Human's timing is notable, given that Apple's newest iPhone will no longer feature a headphone jack and may convince more people to buy wireless headphones. Perhaps even more intriguing is the company's plan for additional features. It is offering a limited number of pre-sale customers the chance to beta test technology inside the device that provides instant language translation, advanced biometric monitoring, and sleep tracking. Dieter founded the 40-person company last year with CEO Benjamin Willis. Bill Moore, previously CEO of companies like RootMetrics and Allrecipes, became Human's president and executive chairman earlier this year. Human raised a $5 million investment round this past April, pushing total funding to date is near $6 million.

Late last year, the company expanded to the Americas, choosing Seattle as the location for its first U.S. office. But Whispir has kept its presence here in Seattle under wraps, until now. Monday Whispir gave details about its Seattle office and announced it has completed an approximately $8.9 million Series A funding round led by Telstra Ventures, NSI Ventures, Rippledot Capital, private investors and Jeromy Wells, Whispir's co-founder. Whispir will use the money to continue expanding in the U.S. and Asia. \"We had the operating capital to hire the folks we have,\" Brant Williams, Whispir's vice president for the Americas, told GeekWire. \"This additional capital will put some rocket fuel on it.\" The company describes itself as \"communications-apps-as-a-service\" built on top of Twilio. It helps businesses and organizations, regardless of their technical coding experience, build apps to communicate internally, talk to customers, and function in a crisis. Customers include IBM, Changi Airport in Singapore, Australian Broadcast Corp. and others. Williams is a veteran of Seattle startups as well as RealNetworks and Amazon. In addition to Seattle, Williams also leads Whispir's San Francisco office. Williams told GeekWire the Seattle office has about 10 people right now, many of whom he worked with at RealNetworks, including Global Head of Digital Marketing Andy Boyer and Director of Enterprise Sales Blaine Butler. The Seattle team works out of a 1,400-square-foot space in the Pioneer Square neighborhood that Williams described as \"scrappy chic.\" Williams said the company chose Seattle for its first U.S. office because it has a comparable level of talent to the San Francisco Bay Area, but cost of living is a lot lower here. \"Basically, you'll get (two times) your investment for a top line team and an engineering team in Seattle than you can in the Bay Area,\" Williams said. Whispir is the latest in a stream of more than 80 tech companies big and small to open offices in the Seattle area. GeekWire has closely tracked the opening of these offices in the Seattle area, and you can see the full list here. ",

(Click for interactive graphic)\n When Mowgli Holmes moved back to his home state of Oregon in 2013, the cannabis industry was beginning to take off in a big way -- but as a molecular and evolutionary biologist, Holmes was surprised by the lack of research into cannabis as an agricultural plant. \"This new industry was taking shape really rapidly all around me, and it had no science driving it,\" Holmes said. \"All the basic science that we have for every other crop just doesn't exist, and people are just running with zero knowledge.\" Holmes and co-founder Nishan Karassik started Phylos Bioscience in 2014 to fill that gap in understanding. A new investment round will help the company expand its infrastructure in support of a new phase in its development. Phylos has raised $1.4 million of a planned $5.5 million round, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. \"We're going to be getting an Oregon State cannabis research license, and starting to do the basic genetics research that will help breeders develop new plant varieties,\" Holmes said. Phylos has spent the last two years developing tools to help cannabis breeders and growers learn about the genetics of their crop, including the Phylos Genotype, a tool that catalogs the DNA of  individual plants. Holmes said a commercial version of the tool is planned for release in two weeks. The startup also partnered with the American Museum of Natural History on the Cannabis Evolution Project, a two-year research project which tested the DNA of thousands of cannabis samples to produce an evolutionary map of the crop. The project also resulted in the Phylos Galaxy, an interactive visualization of the data, including the genetic relationship between cannabis strains. \"We tried to make it so that the basic visualization of the genetic structure of the population would be interactive, so people could play with it and zoom around in it and learn from it,\" Holmes said. Holmes also pointed out that, unlike in many agricultural industries, genetic information can be as valuable and interesting to a consumer as it is to growers and breeders. Holmes now serves as Phylos Bioscience's chief science officer, and Karassik as its CEO. The startup employs 15 people at its headquarters in downtown Portland. ",

Last year, they embarked on an entirely new partnership: A startup. Together they launched Cobelay, a matchmaking service for people looking to buy and sell small businesses. They saw first-hand how much friction was involved in trying to transfer ownership of a company and decided to build a solution. \"The buying and selling of small business has largely remained analog in a digital world,\" said Jenny Feinberg. \"There's an opportunity to leverage technology to 'match' owners with qualified and eager buyers looking to be their own boss.\" Jenny most recently worked for Zillow where she led mobile strategy and product marketing efforts. Steve spent years working mergers and acquisitions for aviation companies like Boeing and United Airlines. Their 7-person startup, which includes two other silent co-founders, operates out of Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. They believe their platform can help small business owners struggling to decide what to do with their companies when they retire. \"We help business owners identify successors who first and foremost share the owner's values, and are qualified to take over, and potentially even grow, the business,\" said Jenny Feinberg. We caught up with her for this installment of Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"We are connecting small business owners with successors who can take over their business and grow their legacy into the future.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"We were on a road trip to the Olympic peninsula with a few friends. I had been trying to buy a small business for a year, Steve had just closed an acquisition for Boeing, and our travel friends had just sold their small business. In talking about how difficult it is had been for me to find a business to buy and how their deals had fallen into place, we decided there had to be a better way. This was a problem that was not only solvable, but also worth solving.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Bootstrap. Our founding team has been exposed to a variety of startups throughout the course of our separate careers; before we took on the pressure and visibility that comes with taking funding, we wanted to make sure that our idea had potential and motivated us on a deep personal level.

We will be friends long after Cobelay succeeds or fails.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Starting in too niche a market.

      "content": "Sound Pharmaceuticals co-founder and CEO Dr. Jonathan Kil. Photo: Sound Pharmaceuticals\n Sound Pharmaceuticals, a Seattle startup developing therapies and preventative treatments for hearing loss, is in the midst of a $30 million investment round with more $4 million raised so far, according to co-founder and CEO Jonathan Kil. The funds will support the second phase trial of SPI-1005, a drug containing Ebselen, which is a potential therapy for hearing loss and bipolar disorder among other conditions. After successful results in early trials, SPI-1005 will now enter mid- and late-stage trials, which will help determine its effectiveness as a noise-induced hearing loss treatment and will advance Ebselen towards being approved by the FDA, Kil said. Noise-induced hearing loss is currently non-reversible. It is also a surprisingly common issue, affecting approximately 15 percent of Americans, and is diagnosed in active-duty veterans at much higher rates. Ebselen is an anti-inflammatory that can enter the cochlea -- the organ in the inner ear which creates neural signals in response to sound -- and actively heal cells damaged by noise exposure, which could potentially prevent or reverse hearing loss, Kil said. Ebselen is also being studied in other drugs as a potential treatment for other neurological and inner ear conditions, including Meniere's disease and toxicity in the ear, a side effect of many drugs including some antibiotics and chemotherapies. Because Ebselen can also cross the blood-brain barrier, a difficult obstacle for neurological drugs, it is also being studied as a potential therapy for bipolar disorder at Oxford University, Kil said. Kil, who specializes in auditory neuroscience, said there is a huge unmet need for hearing loss therapies: despite being the third most common chronic condition in the developed world, there are no drugs which treat or prevent hearing loss. Although implants work well for those who need them, there is still a gap between that treatment and the needs of many patients, he said. \"Those are a wonderful invention, but they're not for the majority of people with sensorineural hearing loss,\" Kil said. \"Most people aren't deaf, they are hearing impaired,\" and thus the cost of implants can severely outweigh the benefits, leaving them with few options, Kil said. Kil and Sound Pharmaceuticals co-founder and Chief Science Officer Eric Lynch were inspired to found the company when they met at the University of Washingon sixteen years ago. Lynch had just helped identify the first gene known to causes deafness, but he was interested in more directly applicable work. Kil was doing research to identify the protein that inhibits regeneration of the cochlea, possibly the key to reversing or preventing hearing disorder. Together, they left the UW and founded Sound Pharmaceuticals in 2002, and are developing this and other research into therapies for hearing loss. Kil said Sound Pharmaceuticals is the only company he knows of focused on treating sensorineural hearing loss, or hearing loss caused by damage to the cochlea and nerves that communicate between it and the brain. The company is still in its original headquarters in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood, and employs a staff of 10, largely researchers. ",

      "content": "Seattle startups struggle to compete with tech giants for talent. (Photo via BigStock).\n Seattle's tech industry is on fire with Microsoft and Amazon growing like mad, and dozens of Silicon Valley tech giants -- Google, Apple, Facebook, Oracle, Salesforce, Adobe, HP, Twitter (and dozens more) --expanding in the region with major engineering centers. The University of Washington boasts one of the country's top computer science and engineering programs, while the Seattle area has emerged as the epicenter of the cloud technology industry. But it's not all good news in Seattle. RELATED CONTENTCheck out GeekWire's list of Seattle-Area Engineering Centers established by out-of-town companies.With the larger companies taking root -- driving up wages in what's best described as a talent war -- startup companies are having a tougher time competing for the engineers, developers and designers that can help build their companies. In other words, the big companies are sucking up the talent, offering lucrative signing bonuses and out-of-this-world comp packages. Over time, this will starve startups, diminishing their ability to compete. One could argue that one star engineer at a startup is more critical than one star engineer at a big company, since startups exist with relatively few people. The loss of one key employee to a bigger company can cause severe pain. Seattle's tech industry is at a crossroads -- will it be the bastion of the big companies or can it find a way to support a new generation of groundbreaking startups. Just 175 miles south, it's a far different story in Portland. The city does not boast a major tech anchor tenant. (Yes, Intel employs thousands of engineers in nearby Hillsboro, and the semiconductor giant is the largest private employer in the state, but it really does not compete for the same type of software talent as startups do). A few of the big Bay Area companies have established engineering centers in Portland, but nothing what like is happening in Seattle. As a result, the startup ecosystem in Portland is in a unique situation. Some of the most creative, enterprising and intelligent Portland techies work at startups -- and the startup companies can hire this talent for less than it would take in Seattle. While a talented engineer in Seattle may be weighing job offers from Google, Amazon and Facebook, that same engineer in Portland does not have as many choices. As a result, salaries don't inflate, and startups have a fighting chance to hire and retain employees. This bodes well for the growth and evolution of Portland's startup scene, one of the reasons why the city has seen some noteworthy acquisitions (Amazon.com acquired Elemental Technologies and CenturyLink acquired Orchestrate) of late. Of course, the lack of larger tech companies in Portland has a negative side as well. High-growth startups need these bigger (and sometimes more bureaucratic) companies for their own talent needs, poaching highly-skilled tech talent. Without that bigger talent pool, the ability to scale in a relatively elastic manner becomes rather challenging. Over the years, this has been one of the reasons why fast-growing Portland startups moved their headquarters to the Bay Area with its deep pool of talent. While Seattle and Portland have come to where they are through different journeys and exist at very different levels of scale, it's very important to understand the needs of the startup ecosystem and to nurture that part of the economy to ensure that the region as a whole remains thriving and competitive. Research studies prove that a healthy startup ecosystem is vital to a thriving economy. The Kauffman Foundation recently reported that virtually all net new job growth occurs from companies which are less than 5 years old (e.g. startups). This is intuitively logical as when companies mature, they tend to shed jobs in their effort to stay competitive and profitable. So in spite of the recent wave of large tech companies establishing new offices in Seattle, a vibrant startup community remains an essential foundational element for the future of this region and for any 21st century community. It will be interesting to watch which startup community finds more success in the next five years: Seattle or Portland. ",

      "content": "Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen speaks at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco on Tuesday. (GeekWire photos)\n SAN FRANCISCO -- \"Fail fast\" is a well-known phrase in the startup world -- or \"fail forward\" and \"fail better\" -- used by many entrepreneurs and investors to describe the process of rapidly identifying bad ideas and iterations as a way to ultimately arrive at a successful solution. Marc Andreessen isn't a fan. The venture capitalist spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco on Tuesday, touching on topics like A.I., his VC firm, and of course, Twitter. Asked about how entrepreneurs should balance daily work with long-term goals, particularly when it comes to treating failure, Andreessen cited military strategies that revolve around separating goals and tactics from one another. \"It's incredibly important to have a really vivid, clear idea of where to get in the long run that you stick to and are very sold on and that everyone agrees to -- then, be very, very flexible on tactics,\" he said. \"The problem is, it's a dichotomy, a contradiction. You have to think about the long term, but also day-to-day tactics.\"  Andreessen said that \"fail fast\" makes sense for tactics -- \"if a tactic doesn't work, find another tactic.\" But not so much for longer-term goals. \"I think 'fail fast' is catastrophic if it is applied to strategy and goals,\" he explained. \"A lot of founders talk themselves out of what are going to be good ideas in the long run because they aren't getting immediate traction.\" Andreessen said that the ability for today's entrepreneurs to access wide-ranging and immediate metrics, while sometimes beneficial, can also be detrimental. \"It's really easy to get distracted by and draw long-term conclusions from that short-term data,\" he said. \"You see companies that have gotten in real trouble over that. Conversely, you see companies that work for a very long time on something that people think is just completely nutty and they get heavily criticized along the way.\" This is something that Andreessen has touched on before. My goal is not to fail fast. My goal is to succeed over the long run. They are not the same thing. -- Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) September 12, 2014 With the ability to receive immediate feedback in today's rapidly-improving technology world, should startups listen to initial reaction from clients and users? Or should they stick it out? There are success stories for both strategies. But Andreessen said on Tuesday that one fact has held true throughout time. \"For all this whole thing about how everything is supposed to be speeding up, it still takes a decade or more to build something really significant in this world,\" he said. \"It still really does.\" ",

Pete Higgins, partner at Second Avenue, will join Slope's board as a result of the investment. Slope plans to hire two senior engineers to build out its product. Today, Slope has a staff of seven. Slope's content management software became available to the public Monday, starting at $30 a month per user. The company has been beta testing its product for the last nine months or so. During that time, it has signed up more than 3,500 customers for its waitlist. Current paying customers include Microsoft, Title Source, and Scalr. In the old days, businesses used to outsource much of their creative content to ad agencies and other firms. But increasingly, big companies and even some smaller ones produce their multimedia content -- videos, graphics, etc. -- in-house. But the tools to manage and work on those projects are lacking, say Slope's founders Brian Bosche and Dan Bloom. \"(Businesses) still use the same tools they tried to use when writing blog posts or putting together PowerPoint presentations, where it's still largely email, spreadsheets, internal server file-sharing,\" Bosche said. \"You have this new challenge and this new problem with businesses trying to become content producers themselves.\"Three years ago, Bosche and Bloom founded Slope as a creative agency in Detroit. Neither came in with a technology background, but they both participated in the Venture for America program, which places young entrepreneurial people at startups and early stage companies in cities in need of revitalization. Bosche and Bloom hit it off during the program's training camp and re-connected after completing the program. But after working on numerous video and multimedia campaigns, they became frustrated by inefficiencies in creative marketing collaboration, so they decided to build a platform that streamlined the process. \"After working with hundreds of clients as a creative agency, we realized how difficult it is for businesses to collaborate on video, designs, images, and other creative content; so we decided to solve the problem ourselves - that's how Slope was born,\" Bloom said. After changing direction, Slope moved to Seattle to participate in the Microsoft Ventures Accelerator program, and in March 2015 the company raised a $420,000 angel round. After that the company began beta testing in anticipation of its public launch. \"It's a lots of little things,\" Bosche said of the improvements made to the product during testing. \"For us, it wasn't really any huge thing that we got advice from, it was just constant refinement over months of working with customers really closely.\" ",

As with many stroke victims, the ordeal made communicating difficult. Rogers and her father, a software developer, looked for an app to help him express his needs and work on his speech. They didn't find any good options. She took the problem to several classmates and, under her father's mentorship, they developed an app of their own. Hospital Stay: Stroke is designed to help patients who have just suffered a stroke communicate basic needs. It has buttons for \"Yes, No, Clean Me, Roll Over, Bathroom, and Pain.\" They went on to develop an app for stroke patients in later stages of recovery. Aphasia Therapy helps people regain their speech, by populating the app with photos of important things in their day-to-day life. \"The stroke survivors' caretaker can take pictures, give the picture a name, and record themself saying the word correctly,\" said Rogers. \"Then the stroke patient can practice saying the pictures and determine if they got the picture correct by listening to the audio clip.\" Rogers and former high school classmates Gary Yost, Nathan Wacker, Kevin Lee, and Maddie Fletcher, developed the apps as part of a small startup, called Sharp Synaptics. The company is headquartered in Federal Way, Wash. but several of its co-founders work remotely, as they have gone on to college.

Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"We create iOS apps for people struggling with aphasia and other communication disabilities.\" Inspiration hit us when: \"In November 2015, my grandfather had a stroke and now suffers from aphasia. Aphasia is the loss of the ability to express speech. When looking for apps to help him regain his speech we noticed that almost all of the apps targeted to aphasia patients are extremely overpriced or way too over-complicated for a stroke survivor to use. That's when we decided to make our own apps to help aphasia victims.\" VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Bootstrap. We all pitched in a little money to start up our company. We kept our costs to a minimum and worked on our own time.\" Our 'secret sauce' is: \"We have higher-quality products at a lower price point than our competition, that are simple for a stroke patient to use.\" The smartest move we've made so far: \"Evaluated what others have done and improved upon their applications. There are apps in the space we're competing in but their usability wasn't that great, which is a big drawback for our target audience, which is typically impaired and often elderly users. We went with very, very simple UI design principles and also focused on a key concept, which was to not focus on general therapy for users with libraries of common icons and objects, but to focus on the items that are actually important to them -- pictures of loved ones, favorite foods, etc.\" The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"The biggest mistake was not anticipating the differing availability of our team members during a very busy summer.  We work very non-traditional schedules and are not co-located so this made work very challenging at times.  We expected more core time together during the summer but it didn't work out that way, so we all had to be very flexible working with each other and we had some incredible bursts that occurred when we could co-locate and work together. We put in some very long days at times but also managed to enjoy our summer break from school.\" Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Gates because he is interested in helping others, which is what our app aims to do.\" Our favorite team-building activity is: \"All of us were completely new to team-based development and our mentor selected GitLab for our source control management system and we had to learn the tool very quickly. Managing conflicts was challenging, as our first app was very small.  Our mentor set up exercises to prepare us for development but we spent a lot of time on Google Hangouts trying to work through this. Misery loved company.\" The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"We are a very small company composed of our five co-founders. Right now we are not looking to hire anyone.\" What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Just because you haven't done something before doesn't mean you can't. All five of us started this company without any experience programming in Swift, and now we are selling our apps in the Apple App Store.\" ",

      "content": "Far from aiming for a moonshot, the 2017 Budget delivered by Treasurer Scott Morrison was all about encouraging Australians to \"live within our means\" in order to get the budget back to balance by 2020-21. As much of the tech community expected, innovation seemed to be more of an afterthought, with a new levy on Australia's biggest banks and measures to improve housing affordability sure to dominate the headlines for the coming days.  Alex McCauley, StartupAUS CEO, said the government has a lot of work to do to deliver on its commitment to make Australia a world-leading innovator, describing the measures introduced tonight \"modest\" both in their budget impact and overall effect. \"Innovation and entrepreneurship are not major focal points of this budget...in this year's speech, entrepreneurs were not mentioned. Startups seem to have dropped off the radar,\" he said.  Though it may not have been a big part of Morrison's speech, there are hints buried in the budget papers that - maybe - something big is in the pipeline, with the Government reiterating its focus on innovation by recalling the fact it has commissioned a 2030 Strategic Plan from Innovation and Science Australia. The Plan, to be delivered in the last quarter of 2017, will look to outline what Australia's Innovation, Science, and Research (ISR) System \"should look like into the future\", identifying key priorities the Government must address to build Australia's innovation capabilities. With this in mind, perhaps it makes sense the Government isn't splashing another NISA-like sum on innovation just yet - though there is merit to the argument put forward by Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen last week that the Government must do more to communicate the message of innovation and its possibilities to all Australians. The Government will also develop a Research Infrastructure Investment Plan to \"inform future investment in research infrastructure facilities and projects\" and support greater collaboration between industry and researchers, ensuring Australia's research capabilities meet the needs of the growing economy. So, maybe NISA 2.0 will come with the delivery of the 2030 Strategic Plan, but in the more immediate term, there are a few nuggets to be found in the budget papers for tech and startups.  Among these is the promise of a new Crowd-Sourced Equity Framework (CSEF), finally opening equity crowdfunding up to proprietary companies, through $4.5 million in funding over four years from 2017-18 to help the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) extend the framework.  With fintech a niche within the all-encompassing innovation space that the Turnbull Government has long seemed particularly devoted to, $1.2 million in 2017-18 will be provided to allow the Department of the Treasury conduct an independent review into the most appropriate implementation model for an open banking regime, which would require the banking to share product and customer data and open up the door for new fintech offerings. The Government has also announced it will remove double taxation on digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, from 1 July 2017, removing an obstacle for fintechs; currently, digital currency is treated as 'intangible property' for GST purposes. The regulatory sandbox put in place last year to allow fintechs to test new products more easily, will be expanded to include new types of services, including \"providing more holistic financial advice\", issuing consumer credit, offering short term deposit or payment products, and operating a CSEF intermediary. The program will be extended from 12 to 24 months. Danielle Szetho, CEO of Fintech Australia, welcomed the measures, saying, \"They're a huge step forward when it comes to growing a globally competitive Australian fintech industry, that will also deliver greater choice and improved financial outcomes for consumers.\" \"It is pleasing to see that the government has clearly used the budget to reaffirm its commitment to Australia's fintech industry, and sees this industry as a driver of increased consumer choice and jobs growth in financial services.\" Following the abolishing - or rebranding - of the 457 visa a few weeks ago, the Government will also introduce an annual foreign worker levy of $1,200 or $1,800 per worker per year on temporary work visas, and a one-off levy of $3,000 or $5,000 for those on a permanent skilled visa. The $1.2 billion raised from the levy over the next four years will contribute directly to a new Federal-State Skilling Australians Fund. Meanwhile, announced by Minister for Innovation, Arthur Sinodinos earlier today was a $100 million funding package that will see the creation of an Advanced Manufacturing Fund to boost innovation in the manufacturing sector.  Included in the package is $47.5 million over two years for an Advanced Manufacturing Growth Fund, aiming to help high value manufacturing businesses in South Australia and Victoria become more competitive through new processes and equipment by funding up to a third of the project cost of capital upgrades.  An Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre will be established with $4 million in funding over two years to support small scale and pilot research projects in advanced manufacturing, while $10 million will go to the development of Innovation Labs in South Australia and Victoria, to be delivered through existing services such as the Entrepreneurs' Programme, Industry Growth Centres, and Austrade.  The Government has also committed $26 million over four years to optical astronomy to enable Australia to become a strategic partner of the European Southern Observatory, which it stated will allow Australian researchers \"new opportunities for international collaboration and greater access to world-leading astronomy infrastructure\". Though not purely innovation-focused, a significant chunk of change has been put towards developing regional Australia. The benefits of building regional Australia's capabilities, according to a report released by the Commonwealth Bank in March, could be significant: the regional economy could grow by $44 billion every year if regional businesses were to fully unleash their innovation potential. A Regional Growth Fund will be established with $472 million for regional infrastructure projects; within this, $272 million will provide grants of $10 million or more for major projects to \"support long-term economic growth and create jobs in regions undergoing structural adjustment\".  Another $200 million will be provided to the existing Building Better Regions Fund (BBRF) to support the construction of community infrastructure and build the capacity of regional areas, while $220 million will see the creation of a Regional Jobs and Investment Packages, aiming to create new jobs and deliver sustainable employment.  With connectivity a key issue, the Government is putting a further $60 million towards the Mobile Black Spot Program to 2019-20, adding to the existing $160 million for the program.  To bridge skills gaps, the Government will also provide $24 million over four years from 2017-18 to establish a Rural and Regional Enterprise Scholarships program to help develop opportunities for regional students.  From 2017, at least 1,200 scholarships of up to $20,000 each will be available for tertiary students in \"priority fields of study\" including science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and health.

      "content": "Western Australia-based security monitoring startup iCetana has announced the raising of a $8 million funding round led by Perth VC firm Go Capital, which will be used to build out the startup's 'iCetana' detection system and expand worldwide. Alongside Go Capital, iCetana received contributions from asset management firm Delcor Family Office and a range of local angel investors. The round also saw participation from returning Perth investor Yuuwa Capital, who had led the startup's $1.5 million Series A funding round in 2010, and invested another undisclosed sum two years later. Founded in 2010, iCetana's software meshes machine learning, computer vision and pattern recognition adaptive algorithms together to identify notable 'events' or activity captured on a security camera. Designed for a security system handling hundreds of cameras, iCetana will only show security personnel the cameras that are experiencing these abnormal events, thereby removing the need for the operators to monitor piles of camera streams all at once. The startup emerged out of WA's Curtin University, expanding upon anomaly detection detection algorithms developed within the institution's School of Computer Science. iCentana now distributes its software, which is installed on a specially configured server, to clients working with up to 2,000 security cameras, with each server monitoring roughly 100 cameras at time. Beginning its run in Australia, the startup currently offers its software to the public transport, retail, education campus and public infrastructure markets across the Middle East, USA, and several European countries. With the close of the fresh funding round, iCetana is now looking to expand its software offering further across Europe and into South East Asia, targeting the defence markets, while also enhancing its platform with new features. Speaking about the announcement, iCetana chairperson Rohan McDougall said the startup is excited about its next phase of growth, which will respond to the growing demand for security solutions. \"iCetana is seeing a significant increase in international demand for its product and now has installations in 10 countries. The board is excited to welcome new investors, including Go Capital, to the company to join us on the next phase of growth,\" he said. In the wake of increased global security concerns, the video surveillance market is expected to grow to US$71 billion globally by 2022, with surveillance cameras numbers predicted to rise by 46 percent alongside this market growth, according to a forecast from Markets to Markets. Set to join iCetana's board, Go Capital chairman Geoff Pritchard said the firm is pleased to back the startup, adding that they're confident in the company's ability to continue growing. \"The quality of the team, the traction that the business has achieved with a global, blue-chip client base and the technology that applies machine-learning/artificial intelligence to big data in the video surveillance sector, developed and refined over seven years and with significant currency in the global environment in which we now live, means that we believe this business has substantial upside,\" said Pritchard.

      "content": "Startupbootcamp has been busy since its arrival down under was announced by LaunchVic last August. The organisation, a global network of industry-focused accelerators founded in Copenhagen in 2010, received $600,000 from the Victorian government's startup body to help it open a hardware lab in Melbourne and fund the launch of an accelerator program this year. As it gears up to open the doors to the lab and applications for the accelerator, Startupbootcamp has been working to immerse itself in the Melbourne startup landscape through other events, for example partnering with facilities management provider Spotless Group to host an IoT and datatech hackathon at the MCG last November. To further its focus on the Internet of Things, Startupbootcamp partnered with the City of Melbourne to host IoT & Data FastTrack for Melbourne Knowledge Week last Friday. With the City of Melbourne looking to establish Melbourne as Australia's 'smartest' city, the event saw local startups pitch to a panel of industry experts and network to seek out opportunities for collaborative. For Trevor Townsend, managing director of Startupbootcamp, the involvement of the City of Melbourne was key; rather than startups working in silos, he believes more must be done to drive cross-collaboration and connect startups to the right people who can help them develop and deploy real-world solutions that will improve the way cities operate. \"The significance of having a large city council supporting the ecosystem can not be underestimated. Startups focused on Smart Cities solutions need input from the city to ensure that solutions are viable and meet the city's needs,\" he said. \"Policy makers should be supporting startups, as both an economic stimulus through new job creation and as well as a way to get new and innovative solutions to citizens and visitors.\" Dr Jackie Watts, a City of Melbourne councillor and chair of the Knowledge City portfolio, said the City recognises that startups are central to ensuring Melbourne's \"knowledge economy\" grows and thrives. \"In sustaining the 'liveability' of our city we encourage talented knowledge sector workers, and investment tends to follow this talent. It is crucial that we consult with the startup community to better understand the core needs of those with the talent and the drive to start up a businesses in Melbourne,\" she said. Consultations with the startup community are becoming increasingly important, with the City gearing up to deliver its Startup Action Plan. This plan, Watts said, is being designed to foster a supportive and inclusive business culture, accelerate innovation, and provide access to municipal data. On this front, the City of Melbourne already runs an Open Data platform, which boasts almost 100 data sets for anyone to use; such data sets include a 24 hour pedestrian counting system, which aims to help the City and users understand pedestrian activity in busy locations. Among the startups presenting on Friday was SofiHub, a smart device using sensors to learn what is normal activity for a person in their own home, allowing it to detect abnormal activity and alert loved ones of potential emergencies, and GoGet, the car sharing platform that is now working to develop a fleet of cars that provide disabled individuals with an easier, smarter mode of transport. Also pitching were CyclePort, a smart bike sharing system with electric bike charging capacity; muru-D grad SkyGrid, a platform looking to simplify the process of servicing and repairing utilities through an equipment monitoring service that ensures technicians arrive with the correct tools for the job, even before a fault has even impacted the user; and Augmented Reality Experts, developing a platform allowing anyone to create their own AR content.

      "content": "Reflecting the waves of tourist buses clogging city roads, Australia's international tourism numbers are continuously increasing - roughly 4.3 million international visitors ventured down under for the purpose of travel in the year to February. In response to this large market, the startup landscape has seen a plethora of 'social travel' solutions emerge; from Travello to HerePin, Triplify, Backpackr, Bindle, Thubit and timeBlend, many local startups have launched looking to become the next big thing in the travel world. An international startup launching in Australia today is KimKim, looking to shift the experience of booking travel. Through an online platform, KimKim connects customers looking to book a trip with a travel specialist either based, or well versed in, the country a customer wants to travel to. Over an online chat, the travel agent will work beside the customer to put the trip together, with the ability to share links, pictures, itineraries and other documents over the chat for the customer to access. Once a traveller is on their trip, they're able to use KimKim to contact the travel professional if any issues arise or to ask additional questions, with the response time decreased due to the likelihood of the travel agent residing in the same country the traveller is staying in. As the startup's founder, Joost Schreve put it, travellers are able to \"troubleshoot in real time\". \"We're reinventing that travel agent model in a more distributed way,\" he said. A veteran of the travel industry, Schreve previously founded a travel startup called 'EveryTrail', acquired by global travel platform TripAdvisor in 2011. The entrepreneur then moved on to working within TripAdvisor, an experience he said provided him a lot of valuable insight into the travel industry, especially considering the company's massive 390 million average monthly unique user base. Seeing what both did and didn't work in the travel space, five years into the TripAdvisor gig Schreve decided it was time to move on and launch his own startup again, based around bringing the travel specialist role into the digital age. \"When you try to plan and book a great trip, it's a very complex process. You can either do it completely yourself, which a lot of people do when they're a bit younger and they've got the time...at some point [however], you get tired of trying to wing it and want someone to help organise it. There aren't really any digital solutions for that, other than going to traditional travel agent,\" explained Schreve. Launching roughly a year ago under the name 'HiveTravel', the startup soon adopted the more memorable (and admittedly a little odd) name, KimKim, inspired from an interaction between a customer and travel agent on the platform both named 'Kim'. Development was supported by funding from Silicon Valley angel investors, with the KimKim team moving to raise US$1.5 million (AU$2 million), and combine it with Schreve's own contributions. Using connections in the travel industry, Schreve onboarded two travel specialists from Iceland and Nepal onto the platform, locations picked thanks to their \"smaller market\" size and more streamlined travel options, which made it easier for the startup to handle the early testing stages. Building out a network of specialists across Myanmar, Peru, Colombia, Jordan and now Sydney, Schreve said each travel expert has been vetted and interviewed by the KimKim, to ensure they're up to scratch. He added that most of the agents come to the platform as existing industry veterans in the travel industry with their own established booking business, and they use KimKim to acquire new clients and expand their offering from bricks and mortar stores to online. Leveraging the platform comes at a fee, of course, with 15 percent of the profit a travel specialist makes going to the startup. Once on board, each travel specialist is monitored by KimKim to ensure they're working beside the customer. The startup will also act as a middleman when connecting customers to specialists, a decision which is based on asking the customer a few basic questions while having them write a short description about the trip they're imagining. \"We discovered the best way to get a customised trip is to get a few descriptions for them. It doesn't have to be very long, just a few sentences from them. That's then sent to our team to review the request, then connect them over chat to a specialist,\" said Schreve. Entering the chat room, customers are able to add in their travel buddies to share in the discussion, while the travel agent is also able to tag in their coworkers if need be. Booking a trip from this point often requires some time of back and forth between the customer and travel expert, a process that Schreve explained is to make sure the agent has the time to put the best trip possible together to fit the customer's needs. \"There's usually a few version of the trip plan, so it can be roughly 20 days for a plan to be completed sorted. This doesn't mean they're chatting the full time, of course, but rather it's a back and forth conversation...that can occur at any time. They may log off, and come back later,\" said Schreve. Following the launch in Australia, KimKim will soon be looking to raise funding again, as Schreve said the business is looking to build out its product, global travel specialist network and team numbers to deal with KimKim's growing user base.

      "content": "There's a lot of money to be made by forward-thinking sports clubs and leagues taking China seriously. Years of playing pre-season friendlies and tournaments in Asia saw the English Premier League bag around US$700 million for its Chinese television rights last year, while the NBA's streaming deal with Chinese giant Tencent is also worth a reported US$700 million. A local club making inroads is the AFL's Port Adelaide, which will this weekend play a sold out match against the Gold Coast Suns in Shanghai. While it may the focus of many a headline this week, Andrew Hunter, Port's general manager of China and government relations, said the match is just the beginning of the club's efforts and business interests in China. \"The game itself isn't the final point, it's really the beginning and intrinsic to what we're trying to do, which is bring people from Australia and China together for mutual understanding, for mutual business benefit, and to strengthen, ideally, the bilateral relationship,\" he said. The club first began looking to China in 2014, hosting business lunches in Hong Kong and investing in game development in Chinese schools. Over the years it has created a China Strategy, securing a broadcasting deal, sponsoring Team China and the South China Australian Football League, and coming to see itself as a vehicle for the development of business relationships between Australia and China. This is \"sports diplomacy\", as the club puts it; cultural and language barriers can be hard to overcome in business, but sport can break through. \"We believe that an asset the club has now is an extraordinary network of people in China, the upper echelon of the business community in Shanghai, as well as access to the business community in Australia, because we're a high profile club playing the most high profile sport in the country,\" Hunter said. \"If we can bring those people together so they can get a mutual benefit, where investors want to invest and people on the other side are looking for investment, and we can get a commercial benefit out of it, I think we're playing a really strong role.\" The business community has been growing over the last few years through Port's China Power Club, in effect a business matching group or forum . Here the club worked in collaboration with the South Australian Government, who would fly a dozen or so high net worth business people in from China for networking opportunities with local business people, centered around a football event. Looking to freshen up the concept this year, Port Adelaide is working with the state government to host an Investment Attraction Forum at Adelaide Oval in June ahead of Port's round 13 match against Brisbane. Here, five South Australian businesses will be chosen to pitch to around 25 potential investors. The government has assisted in selecting in investors, with Hunter explaining those chosen all hold visas predicated on their intent to do business in South Australia. \"Similarly, we want to put them in front of people from South Australia who want to do business in China,\" he said. The government will also assist in vetting the businesses selected to pitch; the opportunity is open to companies from all industries looking for a minimum investment of $2-3 million. The companies must also be willing to enter into a commercial arrangement with Port Adelaide, with the club to take a \"modest success fee\" from any deal made through the event. Hunter said the club is treating this first event as a proof of concept, but believes there is enough appetite to expand it in the future; already in the pipeline is a second event in Shanghai towards the end of the year, with a view to running another two in Adelaide and two in China next year. \"I haven't found another sports club that does this, but if you're a business, you need to understand what your assets are, and ours aren't just what's on the field.\" You can learn more about the Investment Attraction Forum here. Disclosure: David Koch, chairman of Port Adelaide Football Club, is a shareholder in Shoe String Media, which owns Startup Daily. ",

      "content": "Melbourne coworking space Blockchain Centre has announced a partnership with IBM, aimed at fostering the development blockchain startup community in Australia.  The partnership, initially running for a year, will see IBM gain access to the coworking space, with a number of the company's developers to also hold office hours at the space. As Amanda Johnston-Pell, chief of startups at IBM Australia and New Zealand, put it, the aim of the collaboration is to help local developers and startups build solutions that will solve real business problems across industries. Martin Davidson, community manager of the Blockchain Centre, said the deal highlights the fact that the blockchain ecosystem is rapidly expanding. \"Our mission has always been to share blockchain education with all members of society by creating a physical space known as a blockchain knowledge and community hub. Blockchain Centre brings together like minded and passionate blockchain enthusiasts and entrepreneurs to collaborate on new blockchain businesses,\" he said. \"We are proud to collaborate with IBM as we consider them like us, pioneers leading the blockchain revolution. IBM's Blockchain Garages are building solutions for enterprise and their support of the Linux Foundation's open source Hyperledger Project offers the developer community open access and transparency to contribute on numerous blockchain projects and applications across many different industry verticals.\" Blockchain Centre was established by Sam Lee in 2014 with the support of his consulting and bitcoin mining business Blockchain Global, offering startups coworking space, workshops, events, and other outreach activities. The Australian blockchain ecosystem has indeed come a long way over the last three years, with peak national standards body Standards Australia earlier this year releasing its roadmap for the development of standards for blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT), looking to set the scene for the development of standards both locally and internationally. Among other things, the roadmap looks to identify the technical issues associated with developing, governing, and using blockchains and DLTs; identify use-cases for blockchain and DLT relevant to Australian stakeholders and assess the need for standards to support specific use cases; and consider the role of standards in supporting potential future regulation on blockchain and the relationship between the law and standards. Looking at the various applications of blockchain, the University of Melbourne earlier this month signed up to trial technology developed by Learning Machine, a platform developed out of MIT. The blockchain-based system allows university educators to collect and show off their 'micro-credentials' in the form of a digital certificate of sorts. An educator looking to earn or claim a micro-credential must develop and submit evidence demonstrating the skill through the platform, with evidence admissible including a project or lesson plan, work samples from students, or text, audio, or video of a classroom interaction. Another user who has already earned this micro-credential will then assess the application. Professor Gregor Kennedy, pro vice-chancellor of teaching and learning at the University of Melbourne, said, \"In a future where career churn and constant technical and organisational innovation are the norm, employers are looking for ways to verify the know-how and skills of employees at a very granular level. \"Similarly, students are increasingly interested in showing the specific skills and abilities they have acquired and developed. Micro-credentials, verified through secure, distributed platforms like Learning Machine's are a means to address this.\" ",

      "content": "After nearly three years of service, Dropbox Australia and New Zealand's Country Manager and Managing Director Charlie Wood has departed from the cloud-storage company to launch his own startup, 'CheckIn Safe'. Announcing his departure via social media over the weekend, Wood said last Friday would mark his final week at the company, following a decision he made earlier this year to leave the global company to start his own business based in Sydney. \"Earlier this year I decided that I would leave Dropbox and go and build a new company/product/category,\" he wrote. \"I'd like to say a hearty thanks to all the Dropbox people I've had the pleasure to work with over these last few years. Good luck with the next phase folks.\" Wood didn't reveal any additional information about CheckInSafe beyond revealing that he was the founder, stating that \"more details\" about the startup would be on the way after he returns from an international trip. The now former Dropbox Country Manager began his tenure at the company back in 2014, moving from an Area Vice President role at Salesforce. He had also held numerous senior positions at Microsoft across the US, UK and New Zealand. Joining the company, Wood was tasked with spearheading its launch in Australia and opening its Sydney office. The company now counts 11,000 Dropbox Business teams in Australia, with 34 percent of the ASX 200 on Dropbox Business. Diversity has also been a focus, with Dropbox last year announcing a partnership with Melbourne startup Diverse City Careers, a business which runs a jobs board full of roles at organisations which share diversity values. The partnership gave the startup ongoing support through educational events, campaigns and webinars, as Wood looked to increase Dropbox's in-house diversity. \"For 2016, we are building key foundational elements to foster a diverse workforce. Our efforts focus on three areas: pipeline, culture and community. We'll work to build our pipeline; create a culture of inclusivity; and invest in organisations that are committed to providing career opportunities for diverse groups like DCC,\" he said at the time. Wood's tenure also saw the company focus on supporting education, through the launch of Dropbox Education, a platform designed to help students and teachers using Dropbox collaborate through the cloud. CheckInSafe isn't Wood's first business, however, with the entrepreneur having launched Sydney-based social media analytics and strategy company Social2CRM back in 2009. The business was later acquired by media monitoring firm Radian6 in 2014, coinciding with Wood's move to Dropbox. Dropbox is planning to announce its new Country Manager for ANZ in the coming weeks.

      "content": "For a generation addicted to phones, taking a step away from constantly checking your inbox or Twitter feed can, admittedly, be difficult. For the young Instagram-obsessed student having to sit back and listen to a lecturer ramble about referencing for two hours, the chances of them slipping their phone into their pocket becomes even less likely. Identifying the gap between the recent generation of digitally-immersed students and traditional education was Sydney-based startup Arludo, who have created educational apps with a focus on teaching biology. With over a dozen educational titles in its arsenal, Arludo's games are focused on teaching university - and later secondary - students using immersive modern game elements, such as augmented reality. Each game is designed around a different biological topic, such as cell division, natural selection, diversity, and ecosystems. That said, there are titles focused on other educational areas for younger students too, such as Explore Colours, a game using augmented reality to teach kids how to create secondary colours. Regardless, each of the games are released free for the Android and Apple app store, with a paid option available to teachers to grant them access to a backend analytical platform. Adhering to its biology focus, Arludo was founded by Evolutionary Biologist and university lecturer Michael Kasumovic, a teacher who had noticed the issues his students experienced when having to take a step back from technology and listen to a lecture in class. \"It's not exactly that the content is difficult, it's just the way that us lecturers must interact with the students. I see that they're really used to using their mobile phones all the time, then they have to come to class and listen to someone talk,\" said Kasumovic. Even between students, interactions have become largely online-based, according to Kasumovic, as he said, \"They're interacting on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and are used to interacting in this digital world. Then when universities and schools give these digital tools out, they typically have to do it on their own.\" The founder discussed these \"digital tools\" as the type of educational platforms a number of universities and schools are rolling out to help teach students content. These platforms are typically online and require a student to sit behind their laptop and work individually, a concept which Kasumovic said he didn't see working with his student cohorts. \"I thought, why not meet students where they're most comfortable to engage them, and that's with their mobile phones. It's this idea about wanting to engage students...to make them feel comfortable about learning and interacting with each other,\" he said. Starting three years ago, the entrepreneur, not versed in coding, developed his first game using an online development tool. Finding that his students liked the experience, he looked to gather developers from colleges around Sydney to develop additional titles; here he went to game and creative development institute SEA Qantm. \"I approached them and started talking to some of the students who were keen on being involved. We made a small prototype, used it in class, the kids loved it, then I got a small grant from Jobs for NSW, which really started it all,\" said Kasumovic. The early games looked to focus on augmented reality, a design that was chosen to give students a chance to interact with their learning in a realistic fashion - something particularly difficult to achieve with biology. Among the augmented reality titles and a personal favourite of Kasumovic's is Reservoir Crabs. The app gives students a chance to bring to life different crabs with their own unique traits. Students are tasked with finding out which traits maximise the animal's individualistic success in a fight, accomplished by reading through scientific papers and notes. Students then gather in groups to design a digital experiment to 'test' the crab's behaviour, a process which, in reality, would take a huge chunk of time. There are also single-player titles available designed to get students to compete against one another, such as Hungry Birds, a game revolving around playing as an adult bird taking care of their young. Students control the bird while gathering food, before returning to the nest and choosing which offspring to feed based on their traits, and the amount of food collected. \"The really unique kind of thing is that these games connect data while everyone's playing. You can compile that data in front of the class and see all the different strategies students used to raise as many offsprings as they can,\" said Kasumovic. \"You can then talk about how different traits and behaviours have evolved, and all of a sudden something just clicks since the students can actually do these things they've been reading about it in their textbooks for so long.\" The possibilities of technology to engage students is being seen by other university lecturers, among them Dr Grainne Oates and Professor Dan Hunter. Together they created Quitch, a gamified learning app that looks to truly engage students in their learning by reminding them outside the classroom via push notifications to answer timed quiz questions based on their coursework. With Arludo's existing collection of games having received downloads from all over the world, the startup is now looking to expand its repertoire. Kasumovic said the business wants to look towards developing within other educational subjects beyond biology, having four titles already set in the development pipeline. To fund an additional six new games, the startup will be launching a crowdfunding campaign on Australian-based platform ReadyGoFund, with the funding goal set at $75,000. The funds will also go towards developing teaching manuals tied into the Australian curriculum and simpler login functionality for younger students. \"We're working beside ReadyFundGo's CEO Jill Storey to ensure we make the best campaign we possibly can, which I don't think I could get from something like Kickstarter,\" said Kasumovic. Fulfilling the startup's interest to develop in new educational areas, Kasumovic added that pledges of over $10 will also be given a 'voucher' allowing them to vote on the subject of the new games.

      "content": "There are a few particularly popular niches within the Australian fintech space, with online small business lenders to platforms allowing consumers to find and negotiate the right home loan particularly hot areas. Another is investment, with offerings popping up to target a breadth of consumers. From the likes of Acorns, which is gathering up a user's 'loose change' and investing it for them, through to Brickx allowing users to invest in property brick by brick, and Stockspot using AI to help better invest its customers' money, the choice for the consumer is vast. Adding another option to the mix is Sydney startup Stake. Founded by Matthew Leibowitz, Jon Abitz, and Daniel Silver, the platform wants to offer Australian investors easier and cheaper access to US stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) than previously available. The idea was born out of Leibowitz's time at US trading firm Optiver, where he saw a vast spread of product available to consumers at an affordable price. \"Australia is on the opposite end...limited product suite, hard to access, and expensive. It was obvious to me that Australians were getting a raw deal,\" he explained. Getting asked by friends where to invest, Leibowitz found there was nothing he really wanted to recommend; Stake is the result, with simplicity at its core. \"Equity markets have been a great source of wealth creation and a key component in economic and technological growth for centuries, but accessing them has been expensive, complicated, and full of conflict,\" Leibowitz said. As Leibowitz explained it, Stake works just like any other online shopping experience - \"you can manage your investments as simply as buying a new pair of shoes,\" he said. \"If you wanted to find an investment related to shoes, you would type 'shoes' into the searchbar, and out would come the shares like Nike, Foot Locker, and Steve Madden. If you wanted to invest in oil-related stocks, you type 'oil', then narrow down the search based on the share type or region of the company or fund, just like you would when playing around on Domain.com.au.\" Adding to the e-commerce experience, users can also see related shares after checking out a company, in the same way the 'see what others bought with this' message comes up on a product page on Amazon, while users can also buy others gift cards. A Discovery bar also shows users curated opportunities based on what's happening in the world or market, looking to help give users an understanding of the various factors driving market conditions, while users can also follow the portfolios of big-name investors like Warren Buffett or see what global traders are doing. \"It's important for us that every person visiting or using Stake can become more educated when it comes to investing,\" Leibowitz said. Aside from education and e-commerce experience, the core to the platform's appeal is to be its low costs. If placing an order for up to 300 shares, the cost will be US$5.99, with a further fee of 2c per share for the buying of any shares beyond 300. The likes of CommSec, meanwhile, charge 0.31 percent of the value of a trade, while Westpac charges 0.65 percent of the value of a trade. Of course, not everyone is making huge buys; as such, though Leibowitz said the platform is for \"anyone who wants to manage their wealth better\", Stake is more focused on the market the cofounders themselves are in: the 30-45 year old professional who doesn't want to go through a financial advisor. \"This market recognizes that investing is a vital part of wealth creation, they are returns-focused, digitally savvy and expect value above talk,\" Leibowitz said. The development of Stake has been supported by a number of partners, including Macquarie, which providers users with an Australian cash management account; OFX, powering its foreign exchange transfer service; and Sanlam Private Wealth, which also operates the investment service of fintech startup Stockspot, providing oversight on Stake's compliance. Orders are executed through Stake's US broker dealer, DriveWealth. These partnerships have enabled Stake to automate the whole process, including the W-8BEN form non-US residents must fill out to have withholding tax deducted, which is handled by DriveWealth. \"We've built an internal and external API suite, which allows us to leverage the skills of our partners so we can focus on the user experience and know that there is full transparency over the money flows, ensuring that the customer's assets are safe,\" Leibowitz said. There are currently over 3,000 US listed shares on Stake, with the startup keen to consider ASX listed stocks if it sees demand from users. It will also look to offer trust and self-managed super fund accounts down the track. The Australian fintech space is hotter than ever, with investment a particularly strong space, however Leibowitz is confident in Stake's product. \"Some would argue that the big four banks and their subsidiary brokers are competitors, but working with them to bring a better solution to market is actually something I encourage,\" Leibowitz said. \"We have a great product and these banks have strong distribution; there can be significant wins for the Australian consumer if we work together. It could be a win, win.\" ",

      "content": "Investment robo-advice startup Stockspot has announced the closing of a $3 million Series B round led by ETF Securities founder Graham Tuckwell, which will be used to help build out its digital product and expand its user base. Marking the third funding round for the business, the Series B saw participation from growth fund Alium Capital, algorithmic trading entrepreneur Danny Bhandari, as well as contributions from returning investors, H2 Venture founders Toby and Ben Heap. With the startup's total raise to date closing in on $5 million, Stockspot founder Chris Brycki accounted the business's growth to the fast growing industry wealth management and investment sectors. \"Globally, robo-advice is the fastest growing category of wealth management, it is expected by 2020 total global assets under management will grow to $2.2 trillion US. Originally fuelled by investors in the US and Europe, Australian investors are fast catching on. I believe the opportunity for Stockspot is huge,\" he said. Brycki added that investment advice will also become increasingly relevant over the years as Australia places a closer focus on self-sufficiency in retirement, with the superannuation system currently sitting at $2.3 trillion and expected to grow. Stockspot's platform offers professional investment advice to an individual based on their financial goals, risk profile and income, to help them make smarter investment decisions. Clients can view their investment earnings through an online dashboard, to help them visualise investment data and make tax reporting easier. Last year saw the business integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into its process of giving financial advice. With this technology, Stockspot takes into account consumer behaviour and actions, offering a tighter, data-driven approach. Following the raise, the business is now looking towards further expanding its digital advice offering, increase its customer base and attracting a \"broader range of Australian investors\" in future. Alium Capital Partner Rajeev Gupta said the firm was confident in Stockspot's ability to meet the \"increasing consumer demand\" for professional investment advice, thanks to the sophistication of the AI-backed technology. \"We've seen a mammoth global shift towards index funds and exchange-traded fund (ETF) investing in the last few years. To leverage this structural shift, we identified Chris and Stockspot as best positioned to benefit from the industry tailwind. Our participation in this funding round is a strategic move to ensure we're backing the leading adviser in digital investment in Australia,\" said Gupta. Danny Bhandari added that Stockspot was unique because of its low cost and transparent offering to the customer. \"People interested in building wealth require high quality, technology enabled advice and investment services. Stockspot offers this in a low cost, transparent and convenient way that really suits investors, whether they are experienced or new to investing,\" he said. Looking towards other avenues for growth, Stockspot recently launched the Stockspot Partners Program, a program which rewards businesses for gaining more investors by granting them access to higher-tier benefits.

      "content": "Pictures can be worth a thousand words - and occasionally a lot of money too. For an architect or design firm, selling the perfect design is at the heart of the industry, regardless of whether the showcasing images are simulated from computer software or photographed with the most aesthetically pleasing lighting. Developing a business-to-business (B2B) marketplace to help architects sell their imagery to product suppliers is Sydney-startup Bookmarc, an online platform slated to enter the market at the end of the month. Bookmarc allows architects to earn cash by \"tagging\" a supplier's product featured within their design, or alternatively sell their work to a product supplier, who can input their product range into an architect's photo to later use for marketing purposes. Looking to fill gaps felt by the two industries, Bookmarc's marketplace means product suppliers are able to access an affordable and sizeable portfolio of professional work to digitally impose their products into, which can help get that perfect catalogue or Facebook photo. Meanwhile, design firms and architects are able to protect their work behind a secure marketplace, earn cash for tagging products, or sell their designs entirely. Helen Awali, the startup's founder, who had previously product marketing agency Specix, said developing Bookmarc meant bringing these two spaces together. \"Architects need somewhere to market their service and attract business. Then we have product suppliers like Bluescope that need photo imagery of where their products are used in projects, and they actually don't have any,\" said Awali. Bookmarc didn't start out as a B2B marketplace, but rather a cloud-based product library for product suppliers, allowing them to upload their project files, such as images and CAD files of their products, for architects to use in their designs. That was back in 2013, but it was last year that Awali decided she had gathered enough feedback from her audience to pivot in the new direction. \"I realised early on for these [architects] in the commercial space, there's not a lot of marketing platforms out there, like a Pinterest, that allow them to showcase what they're doing and put their name out there. On the flip side, through our product library, product suppliers would ask, how do we get more engagement using images? They either didn't have access to any, or they'd have to render their products into an image they grab from Google [without copyright permission],\" said Awali. While these firms were completing designs, according to Awali, there wasn't any central online solution to incentivise the architects to sell or monetise their work beyond the traditional means of completing projects for a client. Bookmarc is a way to \"open\" this additional avenue up. With Bookmarc's old model growing through word of mouth, Awali said design firms began contacting the business to ask what the benefit of the platform could be for them beyond downloading project files from product suppliers, and if they would be able to monetise their work. Previously, designs of an architect's that weren't tied to a project were uploaded as a free online portfolio, meaning anyone could gain access. Looking help validate the idea, Bookmarc opened up to architects last year, allowing them to upload their work. The move was met with a strong response over the year, with Awali saying the business onboarded roughly 1500 design firms across Australia, Europe, and the US. \"They could create a portfolio and tag in product suppliers. They weren't sure why they were doing it yet, but it gave us a lot of information about what we were doing and the direction we needed to go,\" said Awali. To help fund the pivot, Awali looked to Springboard Enterprises Australia, the US-founded accelerator focused on female entrepreneurs. Awali said she wanted to understand how to pitch for capital, where to access it, and gain exposure to the US market through Springboard's hefty US network. \"The US is one of our biggest target markets with all the architecture design firms there,\" she said. Participating in this year's cohort, Awali is now coming up to the end of the four-month program, which wraps up with a final pitch to a crowd of US and local VCs. \"Even though the program only goes for four months...you get a coaching team to look over your pitch deck, your revenue, and you get to network. I think, as women sometimes as well, we're not as confident, so they really instill that into you,\" she said. Once in market, Bookmarc's new model will work by having product suppliers verify each product tag an architect pins in their design. If verified, the architect will be able to earn revenue off the tag. Looking ahead, Awali said the model used by Bookmarc could have opportunities in other industries too which hold similar issues to design firms and product suppliers, although the focus for the meantime will be on getting the platform into market and expanding revenue sources.

      "content": "Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen delivered a scathing assessment of the government's innovation efforts at Sydney fintech hub Stone and Chalk today as he pleaded Labor's own \"case for innovation\". Flanked by Ed Husic, shadow minister for the digital economy and the future of work, Bowen reminded the audience that at this time last year, \"every politician and their cavoodle were singing the praises of an agile, innovative economy\", with Australia basking in \"five minutes of innovation sunshine\". Though the rollout of the National Innovation and Science Agenda has continued, with the government also passing its equity crowdfunding legislation and highlighting its support for fintech, the ideas boom talk has largely died down, while the appointment of a third Minister for Innovation in a year hasn't helped push the message that the innovation agenda is the government's focus. For Bowen, the inability to explain why innovation is important to Australia's economic future is in itself an economic problem. Labor's efforts, Bowen stated, are focused on boosting understanding of innovation and drawing more Australians into the conversation as concerns about automation and the future of work continue to grow. \"Where we stand now, we don't have time to lose: it's crucial the innovation agenda is made relevant to people worried about their - and their nation's - economic future,\" he said. \"It's about existing firms as well as new ones. It's about manufacturing as well as services. It's about rural and regional Australia just as much as it is about cities.\" Describing Labor as \"the party born to advance the quality of life for working Australians\", Bowen believes innovation can help lift living standards, \"which is what we're all about\". The challenge, however, is communicating the message while accepting that innovation will rapidly change the nature of work; new data released today from analytics firm Faethm estimate between 30 and 40 percent of jobs in financial services becoming automated, with particular concern around second-tier players, while 50 percent of existing manufacturing jobs could be affected and 60 percent of fast food jobs may be automated. Husic has regularly made this point over the last year; in a campaign debate with Angus Taylor, Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, he said more had to be done to explain to the broader community what it meant to champion innovation. \"We're all excited about it, but people in the broader community aren't; I represent an electorate 40km away from here, and if I went and had this debate in the Mt Druitt library, I don't think many people would get what we're talking about,\" Husic explained. \"Them not getting what we're talking about is bad news for all of us. A lot of those people think that what we argue for is a job killer. They think that tech rips away jobs, and where do they go next?\" Believing an \"evidence war\" is crucial to properly showcase the need for innovation, Bowen pointed to evidence of jobs created through technology; a 2011 McKinsey study found that for every job lost in France due to the internet over the previous 15 years, 2.4 new jobs had been created. \"Where new technology frontiers have been achieved, it's tended to result in job losses, but also job gains,\" he said. A Labor Government, Bowen said, will have the Productivity Commission produce regular reports on how trade reforms, coupled with new tech developments and automation, benefit all Australians, and here he made a point to highlight inclusion. \"An innovation effort made up of people of all backgrounds, all regions, and sharing the economic uplift instead of dividing a small number of winners extracting their gains from the many who think they've been exploited in the process,\" he said. \"And we need to be making women the central focus in every discussion about startups, truly diversifying our nation's innovation effort, calling up their talent as much as possible. And when this community, the startup community, focuses on bringing people along with it and opening up opportunity, it's inspiring.\" The need to bring regional Australia into the conversation was also highlighted, with Bowen reiterating policy Labor took to last year's election to establish a Regional Innovation Fund and create 20 new accelerators through regional partnerships. \"We're seeing the emergence of a sharper regional focus from within the startup community; it's evidenced through initiatives like Silicon Paddock through to what we're seeing at Runway Geelong,\" he said. However, Bowen said Labor's approach to innovation will see government and innovators working together to build understanding and trust through sustained commitment and partnership, and that the party will be developing further policy in the area to take to the next election. With many also equating idea of innovation with the erosion of working conditions, Bowen made a note to highlight the agreement signed by Unions NSW and Airtasker earlier this week, saying it \"underlines the potential of collaboration between entrepreneurs and unions to achieve outcomes which promote a better society\". The speech comes a few days after Opposition Leader Bill Shorten announced in a pre-budget address to the McKell Institute that a Labor Government would create a 'SMART' visa to bring to Australia the best and brightest in the fields of science, medicine, academia, research, and technology. Labor would also create a new, independent labour market testing body to determine what skills Australia needs and in turn advise the government on skills shortages and future skills needs. ",

      "content": "REA Group, the News Corp-backed company behind digital property marketplace realestate.com.au, has announced the launch of Spacely, a new platform focused on helping Australian businesses find short-term commercial rental properties and coworking spaces. Spacely offers businesses looking for a short-term location to work the ability to discover 'space listings'. Using a location search, customers can find spaces designed for creative, retail or general office work, and also hire areas styled for events and meetings. Each space lists the minimum term it can be rented for, ranging from as little as one hour for a tiny meeting space, to one month for a furnished city office. REA Group's Executive General Manager, Joseph Lyons, said the marketplace was designed as a response to the rising trend of Australian businesses looking to find shorter-term office space. \"The nature of work is changing and there are a growing number of short-term commercial spaces for rent or lease in Australia. The current difficulty is they are spread across multiple websites depending on location and type of space,\" he said. Accessing spaces with shorter minimum terms is becoming increasingly relevant for Australia's growing startup ecosystem, with small to medium scale teams exposed to fluctuations in cash flow and employee count. The pricing slope of a traditional office space isn't exactly affordable for a startup either, with the cost of an office in Sydney or Melbourne CBD rising each year. Following this trend, Tracey Fellows, REA Group's Chief Executive Officer, said Spacely would offer exactly what Australian businesses are looking for. \"With almost 600,000 Australian businesses renting a short-term commercial space last year alone, there is a clear opportunity to make it easier for Australians to find the solution that's right for them,\" Fellows said. Also looking to expand its listing opportunities in other markets, REA Group earlier this year announced the acquisition of Indian real estate platform PropTiger for US$50 million (AU$67 million). With India expected to become the world's third largest real estate market by 2030 thanks to its 1 billion-plus and growing population, Fellows said at the time the acquisition formed part of the company's international growth strategy. \"REA invests in companies that are leaders in their markets. The joint entity will have access to REA Group's expertise and know-how from its operations across the globe,\" she said. The opportunity in Asia had been in REA Group's sights for some time, with the company also acquiring a stake in digital real estate company iProperty, a platform operating in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand, last February. Currently in beta, Spacely has already secured a number of listings across Australia's major cities, with spaces from OfficeHub, Servcorp and Regus available for rent, as well as coworking space at Inspire9, Gravity and The Workery.

      "content": "Australia is a huge market for Airbnb, with NSW a particularly strong growth centre. It's so popular, in fact, that a report released by Deloitte earlier this year found Sydney had jumped from 10th in the ranking of top cities for the platform in 2015, to 5th in 2016. According to the report, NSW boasted 38,000 property listings on Airbnb in 2016, with 60,000 across Australia. With those numbers in mind, it's no surprise that a whole new genre of startups has emerged to support the growth of Airbnb and its competitors: the Airbnb management startup. One of the latest to hit the scene is Hometime, founded by Dave Thompson, a former investment banker, and William Crock, who has a background in engineering project management. The startup has created an Airbnb management and housekeeping services business to, as Thompson puts it, \"make Airbnb stress-free\". He explained, \"Speak to any Airbnb host and they will tell you what a pleasure it is to share their home with others and that the financial rewards are significant. However, it can also be a full time job; five-star reviews are crucial when it comes to maintaining occupancy, and this is no easy task.\" Hometime looks to help hosts \"put their Airbnb properties on autopilot\" by handling each aspect of the hosting experience. As Thompson pointed out, service is crucial to Airbnb, with guests often expecting a bed and breakfast-type stay, however the average host has neither the time nor the expertise to provide that kind of experience to guests, and that's where Hometime wants to come in. The idea came from, as you might have guessed, the founders using Airbnb themselves. Thompson said he ran into trouble when he attempted to manage his Airbnb listing remotely while on this honeymoon - there's a lot involved in the process of receiving guests that's hard to do when you're not near your property, from simply handing over keys to cleaning, restocking supplies, and changing sheets. Returning home, he went through the idea with Crock and they decided to leave their jobs and build on it. Currently available in Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth, Hometime works via a host platform and a vendor portal for contractors who perform the various services offered by the startup, which are split across simple housekeeping or full management of a listing. For the latter, the service starts with chatting with the host to understand what kinds of guests they want to accept - no pets allowed, for example - and how much they want to be earning, and then creating a listing. Here, a photographer can come and take photos of the property, with Hometime then listing the property across various booking platforms, its 'unique pricing data' working to optimise the listed price at different times. From there, the housekeeping and maintenance comes in. Clients can choose to either have housekeepers change the sheets and towels, putting the dirty ones in the laundry basket, or using Hometime's linens. According to Thompson, service providers, or vendors, undergo police checks before being onboarded onto Hometime. Through the app they can accept jobs as per their own availability, while the host is able to check in on guests accepted and services performed through their own portal. Thompson claimed the startup has conducted \"thousands of services\" across hundreds of properties around Australia since it launched in 2015, saying it has seen growth of 20 percent month on month over the past six months. \"We have found a lot of clients begin using us for our housekeeping and then convert to using Hometime for full property management once we've built up their trust levels,\" he said. The service has three pricing levels, with the fee for stand alone, one-off housekeeping services dependent on the type of property. On the management side, Hometime allows clients to pay a 'shared success fee' of 15 percent of a booking, or pay a monthly rate in exchange for having a property fully managed and getting a payout of a set rate each month. Again, given the growth of Airbnb, Hometime isn't the only startup offering these kinds of services. Among its competitors are MadeComfy, while UK outfit Airsorted also recently launched in Sydney, its first expansion market outside the UK. The market is already significant and is sure to keep growing in NSW in particular, with the state government last month stating it will allow property owners to rent out private rooms and entire homes via Airbnb on a short term basis, as well as allowing short term rental of empty properties, such as investment properties. Having raised $500,000 in funding last year, Hometime is focused on growing its service and expanding throughout Australia. ",

      "content": "Growing up, Julie Boulton dreamed of being a brain surgeon, because she was fascinated by the way humans work. A couple of years into her medical degree, however, she was diagnosed with a brain disorder; having developed tremors, a career as a surgeon was suddenly off the table. \"One day I was sitting on the floor pulling apart a computer, and my husband said to me, 'I've never seen you sit still for so long.' I had been sitting there for about three hours and I said, 'I just love this stuff', so he asked me if I had ever thought of being an engineer,\" Boulton recalled. At the time, she barely knew what an engineer was, but after seeking out some information, Boulton thought it might be up her alley. \"I thought, if I like the way people work, I might like the way things work, so I just took a leap.\" Having started her new degree at 27, Boulton is now completing her honours in Computer Engineering at the University of Southern Queensland in Toowoomba, and already has a wealth of industry experience under her belt. Boulton is one of the founders and directors of Audacious Digital, a development and digital marketing agency helping Queensland businesses get online. The agency came out of a Global Startup Battle weekend run at Toowoomba coworking space Canvas in 2015. Boulton and her team - Felicity Dougherty, Matthew Findlay, and Glenn McGuire - originally came together on an app idea, which they are still working on in their spare time, and then found themselves building Audacious Digital almost by accident. One of the team members was also part of another business, which needed a website built; Boulton put her hand up to do it, and Dougherty, who had worked at Colgate Palmolive for 10 years in a brand management role offered to do the graphic design. With that, they had built their first website. \"It was just to generate a little bit of revenue but we thought, we can't really go into the small-scale website business because it's not profitable locally, so we looked at where our niche market falls and followed the money trail and found our niche to be in full-scale digital management and keeping it all small and local,\" Boulton explained. Two years on, Boulton describes Audacious Digital as a team that \"takes audacious ideas and turn them into digital realities\". This might mean working with businesses to flesh out and create an app, website, or some other piece of software, or taking on digital management for a business, which can incorporate the services such as digital branding, blog writing and development, email marketing campaigns, and social media marketing. The agency's clientele is split almost 50/50 between Toowoomba and Brisbane, the three hour round trip there and back to visit clients once a week no barrier. \"At the end of the day, they still spend more time in traffic than I do because after my three hour trip, I've got no traffic for the rest of the week,\" Boulton laughed. Boulton's favourite part of the job is the creativity; Audacious Digital calls itself a \"digital business partner\" for clients, with Boulton saying the majority come to them with more of an idea of the outcomes they want, as opposed to a set of instructions they want carried out. \"It's a lot of butcher's paper on the walls, with a lot of client meetings to make sure we really understand them. We use a lot of visual mediums; if we're trying to get a vision, we'll just create a Pinterest board for the client, and say pin away, because then we can look and see what they want,\" Boulton explained. With this in mind, Boulton said that while Audacious Digital builds tech, at the end of the day its revenue and business model lies in client management and trust. \"We do a lot of ongoing training for our clients to ensure that we not only know where they are now, but also where they want to be so we can make sure we properly build for them and equip them with the resources they need to build on later,\" she explained. \"That defines our platform choice when we build something for them, thinking, how well are you going to be manage this?\" The business's digital management packages offer clients a number of hours with a team member that they can either put towards updating of content, or one-on-one training around a particular aspect of their digital presence. To build on this, Boulton and the team have also developed a new offering they hope will help scale Audacious Digital's reach itself while also building the skills of the local community. Running for six weeks, the WordPress Build-a-long course will look to help a group of people build their own website. \"It's peer to peer learning, as well as that mentored learning with professionals. They not only build a system that works for them, but they've built it, so they know how to use it and they know where everything is, they're not coming into it foreign,\" Boulton explained. \"It's a good way to establish ourselves as leaders in our community, and support our community in education and learning and help people build their own businesses.\" The education aspect is one that Boulton is particularly passionate about following her own experiences in coming to the tech sphere. \"I came from a background where [engineering] wasn't an option for me, but I haven't looked back since. It really feeds my fuel for creativity that I never knew I had; it allows me to be curious and inventive, but it also taught me to be procedural, manage projects, and lead teams. It really ticked all the boxes for me,\" she said. As well as intro to coding classes at Canvas, Boulton has been running robotics workshops for girls in schools for several years, her goal to show them that STEM is open to everyone, not just boys. \"I've worked with kids from primary school through to year 12, and girls just don't see engineering as an option, they don't know what it is. The world needs hairdressers and journalists and everything else, but it also needs female engineers,\" Boulton said. By helping to get girls into the space, Boulton hopes to help the Toowoomba tech and startup ecosystem continue to grow and diversify. \"Some people might think it's hard to find talented people in a town like this, but we've got a lot of under 30s screaming for something innovative and interesting to do; when we posted our most recent job ad for an all-rounder, we were inundated with applications from qualified, fantastic people,\" she said. \"The advantage that we have in Toowoomba is that it's cheaper to live here and to rent office space, and it's got a big support network for innovation.\" This post was bought to you by MYOB.

      "content": "Four years on from launching its muru-D accelerator program in Sydney and taking it to Singapore, Brisbane, and Perth, Telstra has announced its expansion to Melbourne, setting up a program out of its Gurrowa innovation lab. Having opened Gurrowa in 2015, Telstra also announced the space will come to be housed under the umbrella of its new Telstra Labs initiative, with company CTO Hakan Eriksson explaining this will be a single identity that brings together Telstra's innovation and tech capability. Eriksson, who was appointed CTO late last year, said, \"It's a unique environment that allows for rapid experimentation, validation and the implementation of new ideas within Telstra and with our partners and customers.\" Within Gurrowa, Telstra has launched a publicly accessible GSMA Open IoT lab that Eriksson believes is \"a definite game changer\" for the Australian Internet of Things ecosystem. It will allow anyone to create, test, and prototype IoT solutions by giving them access to an array of Telstra's expertise and equipment, including a 3D printer, electronics testing equipment, and fully functional Cat-M1 and NB-IoT networks, with the goal to help foster a community and encourage best-practice sharing of ideas, experience, research, and insights among startups through to global enterprises. \"It means that anyone from university students, to startups, to a multinational company can come here and work with some of the best equipment and minds in the business to bring their IoT solution to life. You can even test your IoT solutions to see how they would work on the Telstra network within a controlled environment,\" Eriksson said. Access to the lab will be free for Telstra partners, while for others access will be granted for a fee, with this scaling according to a company's circumstances. Participants in the new muru-D accelerator will also have access to the lab. The program, which will open applications in the coming months, is currently recruiting an entrepreneur in residence. The program's expansion comes follows the appointment of former Salesforce executive, Julie Trell as CEO of muru-D in February. Trell, who took over from founder Annie Parker, said she was excited to work with Telstra and its growing family of startups to create \"a uniquely Australasian entrepreneurial culture for the digital age\". \"Companies like Telstra realise that a new generation of workers want real social impact and strong values to be a part of daily life in how and where they work.\" Want to know more about what life is like in a muru-D program? Hundreds of teams apply but only 10 are chosen for a place. Docu-series The Dream Academy reveals that taking an idea and turning it into a viable business isn't easy but the rewards you reap when you get it right can be incredible. Coming Soon to Channel 7.

      "content": "Many companies struggle with innovation. A typical strategy for a large corporate that wants to be more innovative is to engage a corporate accelerator for its employees. They may pay hundreds of thousands or millions to fund spots for a few employees in an externally run corporate incubator program. The problem is that it doesn't achieve the desired goals of a culture of internal innovation and enabling employees to create real value \"out of the box\". First of all, employees are taken out of the company for an extended period. They effectively go off into a \"black hole\" for six months, during which time they're cut off from their regular jobs. They stop connecting to the real problem. Some may even want to leave and do other things at the end of it as they've got a taste for startups and entrepreneurship and no longer want to work for a large corporation. In addition, it often breeds resentment with those not picked. Having several staff away for months does nothing to improve the culture of an organisation. Ultimately, it often comes to nothing. The employees come back and present whatever they've learnt to senior managers. Managers judge this on the presentation value not the impact value. There's often no buy-in from the grassroots, as other staff have been excluded from the process. And past that point, it dies off due to red tape. Accelerators have their place, but companies should take a much more democratic and in-house approach -- similar to Google's \"20% time\". This way we can spend the same million dollars but on a range of projects, and back the ones most likely to succeed. Company-wide innovation can be encouraged through a simple, three-step process: The one-page pitch Create a one-page template to encourage staff to identify problem areas, and suggest solutions. The one-page template should be kept simple and easy: able to be developed within a day, and reviewed in half an hour. The 20k budget If they do a good one-pager and you think they're tackling something real, and they've been able to recruit at least one person to work with, give them $20,000 as a budget to work with. They might spend this on a company to do a design prototype, or whatever they think is relevant. The aim is to come up with a much more in-depth proposal: a full development plan, including cost, timeframe, and a trial and rollout plan. The 100k+ budget When the idea has been developed into a proper plan, it can be presented to management, with a request for the budget to execute it. What I'm looking for here is an idea that has been much better thought through. There should be collaboration from a few different stakeholders, and their input. They should be clear about what technologies are needed. At this point you might commit $100,000, or whatever the project calls for. By now we're confident that if we give them the budget we know the project is getting done. Ideally they'll work with preferred solution providers, though there may be special cases where they need to go outside that. But if they're working with partner companies that you know and trust, you'll have more governance over the project. Any kind of company can do this. We developed an app for a mining company that did this. One of their staff came up with a plan to fix an issue they had, the company backed it, and we built a 3D visualisation tool for them which saved the company millions of dollars. At the end of the day it was down to an employee saying \"we could do this better\" and being given the chance to try. This gives employees the ability to feel a sense of ownership, a sense of pride, a sense of community with their fellow employees who they recruit for help the project and results in serious productivity gains across the board. There has to be acceptance by an organisation that not every project will come to fruition. If you do 50 of the $20,000 experiments, a handful will likely go through to the implementation stage. Sometimes the process can involve realising that there was a reason things were done a particular way. Employees go above and beyond when they feel a sense of ownership and control. They often feel uncared for and unheard when a company goes outside to look for innovation. They don't feel valued. But a scheme like this is a morale boost, and you'll often find they put in extra hours in their regular job as a result. The net result is a clear upside for the organisation from productivity gains to a great morale booster. ",

      "content": "Payments company Square has revealed some figures around its growth in Australia since the local launch of its card reader last year, stating that over 60,000 businesses are using one or more of its products. Its suite of products includes the Square Reader, payment APIs, Square Invoices, and an employee management tool. The company, which opened an office in Melbourne in late 2015, stated that it is seeing an average weekly growth of 13 percent in transactions processed with Square across its product range. Within that, it is recording 10 percent weekly average growth in invoices paid online with Square and over 20 percent weekly average growth in ecommerce transactions processed through its APIs. Ben Pfisterer, Square's Australia country manager, said, \"Australia's 2.2 million small to medium-sized businesses are critical to productivity, creating jobs and helping to grow our economy. \"We're proud to be building a powerful and accessible point of sale and payments ecosystem that enables over 60,000 Australian sellers to leverage one or more of our world-class products to grow their businesses.\" The company reported particularly strong growth in Tasmania and Western Australia, where it is growing at an \"above average rate\"; both states have recorded over 100 percent quarterly average growth in new sellers. Square's target market has traditionally been sole traders and micro and small businesses, with over 80 percent of sellers on Square not accepting card payments through a traditional payment terminal prior to using Square. However, Square is also seeing a \"strong push upmarket\" facilitated by the launch of new features such as employee and location management, allowing employers to clock in and out and managers to see transactions processed by each employee to better schedule employees. Also recently released was a virtual terminal, allowing users to key in card details via their browser and send a personalised digital receipt to customers, while its payment APIs and integrations with 25 partners, including ecommerce partners such as BigCommerce and WooCommerce, have also opened up another market. While Square launched in the UK just this past March, Australia has been an advanced market for the company since it arrived. Australia was the second launch market for its Build with Square APIs, introduced locally earlier this year, and the Square contactless card reader, introduced last September. Pfisterer previously told Startup Daily, \"[Australia is] seen as a really advanced market not only from a small business perspective...we know Australian businesses are some of the most tech-savvy there are with a great uptake of new tech, cloud-based systems, but also from a payments innovation perspective.\" Among the products that have not yet made the move down under, however, are Square Payroll and Square Capital, a small business lending service. Square is due to report its earnings for the first quarter of 2017 later this month. It reported earnings of US$452 million for the last quarter of 2016, surpassing the expected US$450 million. The company also last month agreed to hire several employees from shuttering social networking startup Yik Yak and acquire a non-exclusive license to some of its intellectual property for US$1 million.

      "content": "All investment is about risk and reward. The higher the risk, the higher the potential reward - and, of course, the potential for failure. This potential for failure seems to be where many investors get caught. I can't tell you how many times investors and venture capitalists (VCs) say to me, \"I really like this one, but it's a little too early stage for us. There are too many unknowns. Contact us for the next round and we'll see how it's going then.\" Well, the unfortunate reality is there's not going to be a next round if nobody funds the first round. Plus, if there is a next round, it will likely be at two to four times the valuation of the seed round. Enter stage left, the \"Angels\". Thank goodness for the angels: they evaluate the founder's ability to execute, the competition, the quality of the business model and plan as well as other qualitative and quantitative elements. These angel investors realise that to get from a $1 million valuation to a $4 million valuation requires taking a great idea, refining it, validating, testing and acquiring enough customers to show traction. It also then includes validating the demand for the product or service, cost of acquisition and lifetime value of a customer. For this, you will likely be rewarded with that next round at a valuation two to four times the first round and you are well on your way to that 10 or 20x return. If you are starting on that second or even later round, you will need to get to a much higher valuation to get the same multiple return. Of course, at that valuation, the initial angels have already made a massive return. Of course, it goes without saying that this will not happen every time. You will not always get this right, which is why you must spread your risk. I would recommend at least 20 investments, so it is important not to be seduced and go heavy on any single company. It is far better to go small and wide and follow your portfolio companies' and founders' journeys. There will usually be an opportunity for you to increase your position if you feel really positive in a later round. Waiting for that proven investment may cost you more than you think. Don't delay investing because it is too early. Instead, make smaller investments more frequently and always get pre-emptive rights for subsequent capital raising rounds. That way you have the benefit of ongoing due diligence if you want to invest more in the next round. If you don't believe there is demand for the product or service, the financial model is sub-standard, or you don't believe the founders are strong enough or have the right team around them, then don't invest in a startup. But not investing because it is too early means you are waiting for more quantitative data, much of which may not be available until after the valuation has run and you have limited your returns. By the time the market knows you are on to a winner, the returns will not be as great. If you want the excitement of finding and backing a winner and getting great returns, go early but remember, go wide not deep. By Hugh Bickerstaff, Director of Investment, Investible. ",

      "content": "Melbourne IT, the ASX-listed web hosting business, has announced its intent to acquire digital marketing agency WME Group for $39 million to further the growth of its small business (SMB) division. The acquisition will be funded through $9 million in debt funding and a raising of $30.7 million, with the buy expected to add $7.5 million to Melbourne IT's underlying earnings for the current financial year. The company earlier this year completed the acquisition of Outware Systems for $57.84 million, and that of Infoready in early 2016 for $15.4 million to boost its Enterprise Services division. Martin Mercer, CEO of Melbourne IT, said WME Group is a \"logical and strong strategic fit\" for the company given managed marketing solutions are the growth engine for its SMB division. \"We expect this powerful combination will enable us to grow [average revenue per user] at faster rates through enhanced cross sell and customer retention, as well as boost critical capability in search engine optimisation solutions and advanced customer account management,\" he said. Founded in 1996, Melbourne IT reports that its SMB division, operating under brands including Melbourne IT, WebCentral, and Netregistry, has over 450,000 direct customers and provides services to over 700,000 Australian businesses, generating over $90 million in revenue. Its Enterprise Services division, meanwhile, has revenues of over $70 million. As part of the acquisition, WME Group's key management will remain with Melbourne IT. Having launched the company out of his bedroom with $400 in 2008, founder Nick Bell said the time was right for him to exit and hand over the reins to Melbourne IT now, explaining it was important to him the company was left in the hands of people who \"genuinely want to continue its growth\". \"I have a number of other business interests both in Australia and overseas which I want to turn my attention to and help achieve the same growth that WME did,\" he said. \"I am also excited by the potential Australia is showing in providing the foundations for high-quality startups and want to become significantly more involved in nurturing and investing in the talent and ideas we have in our own backyard.\" Also founder of app development company Appscore, Bell has invested in startups including Ideapod, Leadchat, and social influencer platform Tribe, which recently expanded to the UK.

      "content": "ASX-listed Sydney fintech zipMoney has announced a strategic partnership with global ecommerce tool Shopify, which will see the startup's digital wallet solution rolled out to Shopify's network of merchants. zipMoney had been working with Shopify prior to the partnership, integrating its 'zipPay' digital wallet into hundreds of Australian Shopify-powered stores to give shoppers the option to buy now, pay later at the online checkout. Solidifying the relationship, the new partnership will help accelerate the inclusion of zipPay as an option for Shopify's global clients. In the longer term, the business said it will look to flesh out the partnership with Shopify and co-build a tighter knit native integration for the platform, which will provide more insights to merchants and further zipMoney's ability to serve Shopify's 377,000 large merchant base. Expanding its 'buy now, pay later' solution to more online customers has been a strong focus for zipMoney in the last year, with the business having formed partnerships with Australian online payment gateway eWAY in March to enable zipPay as an option for Australian shoppers. The company also partnered with Australian domain hosting provider Crazy Domains, following its acquisition last year of fintech startup Pocketbook for $7.5 million to tap into consumer financial services. Looking to the new partnership, zipMoney's cofounder and CEO Larry Diamond said he's excited to work beside Shopify, adding that it would help fulfil the business's aim of providing an interest-free loan option for shoppers at the checkout. \"Our partnership with Shopify provides enormous value to both retailers and consumers alike providing payment flexibility online and instore. Our aim is for Zip to be everywhere people shop, providing consumers with interest-free flexibility at the checkout,\" he said. Diamond and cofounder Peter Gray created zipMoney in 2013, looking to provide a way for online customers to access interest-free loans for their online purchases. The platform integrates into an online retailer's checkout and can be selected as an alternative payment option, giving customers up to 12 months to repay their debt. Having listed on the ASX in 2015, the business reported generating $11.2 million in revenue in the financial year to date, with transactions on the platform increasing by 66 percent in the March quarter to reach a transaction volume of $61 million, up 22 percent on the second quarter. Speaking about the announcement, Shopify's General Manager for Payments, Paco Suro, said the company is looking forward to working beside the Australian fintech, which looks to grow alongside the rise in alternative payments. \"We have seen the tremendous take up of alternative payments at the checkout as millennials and other customer segments seek better ways to pay. A partnership like this, provides enormous value to our merchants and their end consumers,\" said Suro. The partnership for zipMoney comes as local competitor Afterpay also inks deals with various payment providers and retailers. Having last year partnered with Topshop to provide customers in its physical stores with access to Afterpay, the startup earlier this year partnered with Tyro to see its buy now, pay later solution rolled out to over 17,000 retailers using Tyro's payment terminals.

The program aims to further the growth of Australia's medicinal cannabis industry by bringing together both science and industry leaders in the space from across Australia, the US, Europe, and Israel to help participants understand both the scientific and commercial aspects of the industry. It will take participants through a series of key knowledge areas, including history and sociology, agriculture and genetics, extraction and manufacture, biochemical science, legislation and regulation, and commerce and research and development. Consisting of lectures, workshops, and webinars, the program will be led by Dr Henry Pinskier, chair of the John Curtin Research Centre; Professor John Rosenberg, former Senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor at La Trobe University; and director Rhys Cohen, an industry expert. Among those delivering lectures and workshops will be Dr David Meiri, an assistant professor at the Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Mara Gordon, founder of Aunt Zelda's and Calla Spring Wellness; and Phil Warner, managing director of Ecofibre. Professor Jon Watson, dean of the School of Medicine Faculty of Health at Deakin University, said, \"It is with great satisfaction that I am able to endorse Cann10's unique approach that takes in basic biomedical science, agriculture and cultivation, and also entrepreneurship. This is very unusual, but also fit for purpose.\" The launch of the program comes at a busy time for the Australian medicinal cannabis sector; the use of medical cannabis for patients with chronic or painful illnesses was made legal under the Narcotic Drugs Amendment Act last year, with supply coming from a Victorian cultivation site and import into Australia on a case-by-case basis. With regulators coming around, local accelerator BuddingTech last month announced a partnership with global cannabis software and POS solutions company Guardian Data Software that will see GDS clients leverage BuddingTech's analytical research and consultancy services, with the two organisations to also work together on new educational and research programs. It follows a rush of medicinal cannabis companies launching on the ASX. One of the latest to make its debut was Israeli startup eSense-Lab, which has created technology to 'reverse engineer' the production of a plant's terpene profile. With an initial focus on the cannabis plant, the company produces a product that resembles cannabis in both its smell and taste and medicinal benefits. The Medicinal Cannabis Leadership Program will be one of the first programs run by DeakinCo, which launched through the merger of Deakin University's workforce capability development business, DeakinPrime, and its credentialing business, DeakinDigital, last month. DeakinCo looks to provide a \"modern, flexible approach to learning in the workplace to enhance workforce capability\". Simon Hann, CEO of the new entity, said, \"Our user-centric approach and innovations in credentialing, combined with our link to Deakin University put us in a unique position as the only learning and professional development partner with end-to-end capability enhancement offerings for workplaces.\" ",

      "content": "As you may have noticed on your Facebook feed, video is everywhere, and brands are taking notice. According to data from eMarketer, digital video ad spending in the US is predicted to reach US$28 billion by 2020, up from $9.9 billion in 2016.  Looking to take this video spend and create better content is Sydney startup SnackableTV, a free streaming platform, or network, for high quality short form content aimed at millennial viewers.  Launched in December, the idea for the platform was born was born out of Kontented, a content production agency run by Kate Edwards.  Edwards believes the internet is \"littered\" with either poor-quality short form content - including user-generated content, which Edwards calls \"digital litter\" - targeting young people, or expensive longform content targeting the traditional television or film consumption markets, with nothing in between.  Through SnackableTV, Edwards wants to fill that gap, giving audiences aged between 13 and 30 access to high quality short form content.  The idea first came from Edwards' boredom and her frustration around the lack of ROI Kontented could provide to its commercial partners in the content space.  \"They literally had to rely on a wing and a prayer that their social audiences would pick up the content, but it was often just buried in YouTube. This meant they were spending thousands of dollars on really good quality content, but no one was seeing it,\" she said.  While on maternity leave, Edwards decided something had to change. \"[I thought], if I don't change the way we do things, we will just end up in the same horrible agency cycle that kills all client/agency relationships, and we aren't even an agency. We're the creators; we want to make a great product and have a highly engaged audience to receive the content,\" she said. Edwards told her husband her plans one night when he came home from work, telling him that if they didn't do it she would be quitting the business - and so SnackableTV was born.  \"We focus on episodic content to ensure that the target consumer can still 'binge watch', which we know is the key consumption behaviour for young people,\" Edwards said. SnackableTV is looking to commission and license content for its audience across the broad banners of culture, music, gaming, film, podcasts, and style.  So far, Edwards said there are over 350 episodes of content on the platform created by Kontented and other producers, with these amassing over six million views since it launched in December.  To fund the production of this content, the platform will not use \"ads, spam, and retargeting\", which Edwards calls  \"the shoes following you around the internet effect\", but rather look to help brands produce native content. Getting brands on board shouldn't be too hard, with Kontented having produced content for the likes of Coca Cola, ANZ, and McCafe.  Edwards pointed Netflix out as SnackableTV's closest competitor, but admitted the platform likely shares an audience too with other platforms such as YouTube Red and video networks such as Buzzfeed's.  \"For us though, our most relevant point of difference is that we don't have an opinion. SnackableTV is a platform agnostic of political opinion, gossip, and doesn't stand for anything. We are simply technology enabling storytellers a platform to find and audience, and for an audience we are a platform where you can find great content,\" Edwards explained.  \"Unlike Buzzfeed or Vice or even social media, we're not going to rant and rave. Our shows might, but we as a brand stand completely agnostically of all that fodder and clickbait. We just want to deliver a seamless experience and awesome stories.\" The fact some content will be powered by brands also raises the question of whether SnackableTV can be truly \"agnostic\", while bringing viewers to the network and ensuring content doesn't get lost in the ether won't be easy; the likes of Buzzfeed, Vice, and Youtube are extremely well-known names that millions of viewers flock to because of specific channels, names, or points of view they house and represent. Here, Edwards said SnackableTV is looking at different ways to drive audiences to the platform; one method it's already crossed off the list is engaging influencers, which she said \"felt really insincere and was so clunky in its execution, and didn't deliver results\".  However, SnackableTV has secured a partnership with APN News and Media to broadcast a youth channel on Catch, the company's in-transit content player.  The startup also last month took a $300,000 loan from the NSW Government through its Jobs for NSW arm to help further its growth, with an eye on launching in the US over the next 12 months. ",

      "content": "Melbourne-based fintech startup Airwallex has announced that it has closed a US$13 million (AU$17.3 million) Series A round from Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings, Sequoia Capital China and Mastercard to help fuel the release of new application programming interfaces (API) and expand internationally. For Sequoia Capital China, one of China's earliest investment companies, the investment marks the first contributions for the firm in an Australian startup, with Sequoia Partner, Steven Ji, saying the payment solution \"seriously\" impressed the company. \"Foreign exchange transactions pose a real challenge for businesses that operate across borders, and Airwallex's solution has seriously impressed us in its ability to close the gap and allow companies to financially access markets that may have previously been out of reach,\" he said. Using a peer to peer algorithmic engine, big data analytics and quantitative models that predict currency volatility plus auto-hedge conversions, the Airwallex platform allows its users to send transparent cross-border transactions while avoiding inflated fees and margins. The startup was formed in 2015, participating in the Mastercard Start Path accelerator program before officially launching last year and closing a AU$4.5 million pre-Series A round led by Gobi Partners. Now, with the Series A backing, the startup is looking to accelerate the release of a new series of APIs that will allow businesses to process international payments at a larger scale. Airwallex cofounder and CEO, Jack Zhang, said the startup will look to move alongside the rise of cross-border transactions, as international trade continous to grow. \"Our mission is to eradicate the burden of international payments so that businesses can transact across borders with ease. Armed with a growing number of financial services licences and partnerships across numerous jurisdictions, we aim to make international payments as cheap and simple as domestic payments,\" said Zhang. Fintech Australia CEO, Danielle Szetho, said the Airwallex funding announcement was \"further evidence\" that Australian fintechs are globally competitive and holding an increasingly strong footing within Asia and China. A report from Deloitte last month ranked Sydney eighth out of 44 global fintech hubs and highlighted the work of the fintech community across Australia, in particular its efforts to engage with Asia. The government early last year launched an expert advisory group tasked with developing Australia into the leading market for fintech in the Asia Pacific region, while Sydney fintech hub Stone and Chalk in September welcomed three Chinese startups to the coworking space for three months as part of an 'incubation exchange' program.

      "content": "For a developer, nothing saps away more time or patience than quality assurance (QA) testing. For the unacquainted, imagine if you couldn't send an email without ensuring you had used the perfect spelling, line spacing, font size, grammar, and sentence structure. Emails would bounce if they were deemed 'incorrect', meaning you'd have to backtrack and send test emails after each sentence to narrow down the issue. Bugdojo is a startup looking to ease the pain of QA testing for developers, through an online platform that connects the coding work of small to medium teams to QA professionals for quick, high-quality testing. Focusing on 'interface-based' testing for web platforms and applications, Bugdojo allows developers to integrate their online control repositories such as Github and Bitbucket to the platform, before submitting their code for testing using 'bot commands'. These online repositories act as a sort of Google Drive and project management tool for code, allowing code of any language to be 'hosted' online for collaboration or backup. Once connected to their Bugdojo account, developers are able to write up a 'ticket' containing details about what needs to be tested, before issuing a short 'bot' or coding command that sends the ticket over to a Bugdojo QA tester. The idea, according to the startup's founder Ash Conway, is to allow developers a simplistic and quick way to submit their work for QA testing without sacrificing time or resources. After all, these developers are already using repositories, meaning submitting a ticket for a QA test takes nothing short of a line of code. Following the establishment of another startup called Bugwolf, which focused on user acceptance testing, the final audience-based testing stage for software before release, Conway saw that there was another noticeable gap in the testing market. \"Over time I had the chance to think about other problems and issues in the space. Quite a lot of the time I'd have smaller software engineering teams talk about the issues they ere having in QA and how existing solutions didn't really fit in with their workflow,\" said Conway. Existing solutions, Conway explained, come in the form of medium-large scale QA firms or an in-house QA engineer. However, for a smaller scale development team, such as those working within startups, hiring a dedicated QA person typically isn't worth the cost, while using a larger firm comes with hefty overhead costs. \"You don't always need QA developers full-time when you're a dev team of a smaller scale. They also can be hard to find, and outsourcing is expensive if you use traditional methods of submitting content to a larger QA agency,\" said Conway. Bugdojo, Conway added, cuts out the \"middleman\" in these processes and thus saves smaller development teams cash. To help support these tinier budgets, the startup has adopted a no contract, pay-as-you-go model. Submitting work for QA testing currently costs a flat rate of $10, with the first five tests free. Bugdojo also sports a \"100% quality guarantee\", meaning if a developer isn't happy with the result, the business will waive the fee. As to why a developer would use the platform over testing code themselves, Conway discussed the pros and cons of the process, and where Bugdojo fits in. \"There are a bunch of other things that an engineer will do around QA from an automated perspective. We're not here to replace that, but there are tasks that require a fresh set of eyes and require a real person to test them in a real environment, on another device on a browser,\" he said. \"Because we integrate into the workflow of a small-medium dev team, they don't need to jump out of what they're doing. They can actually do it while they code. I [also] think developers aren't the best people to test their own work. They're also the type who generally find it a pain, so we want to take the annoyance out of that.\" Staying true to the platform's focus on allowing developers to \"content switch\" or submit tests while they code, each completed QA report is returned to the exact ticket the developer issued the test from. Responses are issued with a small description, a 'pass' or 'fail', mark and a video report so a developer can see where any issues occurred, visualised through a screen-capture of the QA tester navigating the material. The testers themselves are industry professionals sourced through Bugdojo, who are vetted through a testing process which pits applicants against a QA testing scenario. To help keep the test fresh, Conway said there's also a machine learning element to the testing process. Once onboard, QA testers are obliged to sign a non-disclosure agreement to protect clients. They'll then be allocated jobs as they come in, and are tasked with completing them and returning a report within an hour. Most testers currently work as freelancers, many full or part time developers looking to earn cash on the side, with Conway saying there will be opportunities for bigger income earnings as the marketplace grows. \"If they fall below a certain level of quality, they'll be sent back to taking the vetting step again,\" he added. Having bootstrapped both Bugdojo and Bugwolf himself, Conway said he's keeping an open mind to funding opportunities in the future; bootstrapping helps him push himself to get customers on board. \"There's a lot of good stuff that comes out of bootstrapping, since you put pressure on yourself to get customers and start making money. It definitely makes things more interesting sometimes,\" he said. Getting customers on board will be exactly what Budojo will look to do next, as the startup works on its marketing plan and target research. ",

      "content": "Workplace laws and unions have struggled to keep up with the gig economy, which has risen to prominence over the last few years thanks to tech companies working via the independent contractor model and, often, a casual disregard for legislation. Making a start is Unions NSW, which has today announced it has come to a \"groundbreaking agreement\" with Airtasker to deliver workers on the platform a number of conditions. Under the agreement, Airtasker will recommend to users \"above comparative award rates\" when they post jobs, with workers to also be offered an \"affordable and flexible\" insurance product, similar to workers' compensation, to cover them against workplace injury and illness. Airtasker will also continue to work with Unions NSW to introduce a dispute resolution process that will be overseen by the Fair Work Commission, and to ensure best practice workplace health and safety standards are in place to protect both workers and consumers using its platform. Mark Morey, secretary of Unions NSW, said the agreement is a big step in improving workplace protection for gig economy workers. \"This agreement is a huge advance for wages and conditions of those working through the Airtasker platform. It establishes an important beachhead for regulating the gig economy. Others should follow Airtasker's example and consider the ethical dimension of their impact,\" he said. \"This is the first plank of a new floor we are building under the gig economy. The fact work is arranged through a website or app should not mean that all notions of decency and fairness are ignored. Airtasker to its credit has recognised this.\" The agreement follows the release of a report from Unions NSW last year criticising Airtasker for low pay rates on its platform; the report found the Airtasker's recommended rates could result in a payment as low as $14.45 an hour after its 15 percent fee was deducted. Airtasker soon after upped its recommended rates, but stated the revision had no link to the Unions NSW report. According to Airtasker cofounder Tim Fung, however, the report did prompt the two parties to meet following its release to \"discuss what we could do together\". \"This was the first time that we'd met with Unions NSW and I think both parties learned a lot from each other and realised that we share a common goal to 'empower workers to realise the full value of their skills',\" he said. Fung stated Airtasker hasn't seen a push from users themselves around this issue, saying the platform already gives users freedom to define the way they work by allowing them to \"proactively select the jobs that they would like to complete, quote how much they would like to be paid, then define the way in which the job will be completed\". However, he said, \"Educating the overall market about how to create a great place for people to work is important and as a startup, we always stay open to new ways that we can improve our product.\" Calling on other platforms to follow Airtasker's example, Morey said the agreement proves the \"digital reorganisation of work\" can flexibly incorporate the workplace standards and conditions Australia has built up over more than a century. \"Across a range of industries, wages and conditions are being shredded by gig economy platforms. If these operators were smart, they would realise that engaging with the trade union movement is a competitive advantage and will help them build a reputation for social responsibility,\" he said. The likelihood of other gig economy platforms following Airtasker's example is an interesting point. \"We're always talking with other startup founders and tech leaders but there hasn't been a great deal of precedence in this space, especially in Australia. Overall, we believe it's really important to work proactively with regulators and government in order to create a sustainable company in the long term,\" Fung said. A number of NSW sharing economy startups came together to launch The Sharing Hub last month, with founding member and founder of pet-sitting startup MadPaws, Alexis Soulopoulos stating a key objective of the hub is to work with government. \"We want to grow the sharing economy as a whole, and how we do that is not only by helping the startups grow but also aligning with government. I think this is a very new space for Australia's startup ecosystem, yet it's growing super rapidly, and in order to ensure that growth is great for the consumer and stays great for the consumer is to align with government,\" he said. Various groups of workers - or independent contractors - have taken matters into their own hands, with rideshare drivers themselves, for example, beginning to unionise. Stating it has over 1,000 members across the United States and Australia, RideShare Drivers United (RSDU) is a group looking to \"help protect the interests of ridesharing drivers through real time discussion, collaboration and collective actions\". With RSDU members in Melbourne having already gone on strike for a day in early April, logging off their driver apps to protest Uber cutting the take home pay of drivers, the RSDU is calling for another strike this Tuesday and Wednesday as its demands have not been met by Uber's general manager in Victoria. Among the demands the RSDU is asking for are fair pay, with base rates to be brought up to line with those in Sydney; a limit to be put on the hours a driver can work, with the RSDU suggesting the limit be put at 12 hours; for Uber to give drivers a 'proper due process' when deactivating drivers; and for Uber to pay GST rather than pass this fee on to drivers. The group stated it intends to file an official complaint with the Fair Work Commission. Elsewhere, a group of Deliveroo riders in the UK last year went on strike to protest a new pay structure proposed by the food delivery company. Deliveroo in turn agreed to allow riders to opt out of the new pay scheme. The Airtasker agreement comes as concerns around the future of work and the role of the gig economy in it continue to grow, highlighted by Airtasker itself in its Future of Work report earlier this year. Having surveyed over 1,000 Australians, the report found over 80 percent of respondents fear automation will see their jobs made redundant across the next five years. With these fears growing, almost 88 percent of respondents said they are looking for more opportunities to earn extra cash; to do so, 7.1 percent said they had already used a sharing economy platform and would again, with a further 59 percent stating they hadn't yet, but were open to doing so.

Paul McCarney, cofounder and CEO of Data Republic, said the company \"couldn't be more excited\" to welcome Rothwell, who he described as an \"incredibly experienced and hands-on technology executive\". He said the startup had been looking for someone like Rothwell for a while, with Rothwell's passion for Australian tech and for the \"productivity potential of data\" that particularly excited him. \"The Data Republic ecosystem is growing fast and as we prepare to scale, Andrew's proven experience navigating tech innovation and growth in highly regulated environments will be invaluable,\" he said. Speaking of his new role, Rothwell said, \"What Paul, Danny and the team at Data Republic are doing is truly game-changing. Data is the currency of the 21st century and the technology and opportunities they're creating are truly industry warping, I'm looking forward to being part of that.\" As COO, Rothwell will be charged with managing platform traction and customer success, streamlining operational procedures for scale, and further integrating customer facing and engineering teams. Emerging in 2014, Data Republic's platform offers a secure space for organisations to collaborate and discuss data exchange projects. Information hosted on Data Republic's 'Open Data Marketplace' is protected behind a legal framework where only authorised users are given permission to access data projects, meaning clients can easily monetise their data assets without the stress of compliance and security flaws. Last year saw the startup look to expansion into the United States following a $10.5 million Series A round from Qantas Loyalty, National Australia Bank's NAB Ventures, and Westpac's Reinventure Fund, with the three organisations joining Data Republic as strategic partners.   Rothwell, of course, has exactly the right experience for the growing fintech.  Over the years at Tyro, Rothwell, alongside cofounders Peter Haig and Paul Wood, led the company through massive stages of growth, including securing $100 million in funding from New York firm Tiger Global Management, Sydney-based TDM Asset Management and Atlassian cofounder Mike Cannon-Brookes in 2015.  The startup also attained a banking licence from the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority to further its goal of providing an alternative for SMEs to the big banks.  \"My passion has always been in the startup industry and Tyro has now successfully grown beyond that stage. I leave it in the capable hands of a strong management team,\" Rothwell said. Gerd Schenkel, Tyro CEO, wished Rothwell the best in his new role and said, \"Andrew's passion for startup businesses is infectious and he can be proud of the long-term shareholder value he has helped generate since cofounding Tyro.\" ",

      "content": "If you've taken a stroll across an iTunes or Android mobile game store recently, then you've likely been exposed to the plethora of Candy Crush and Flappy Bird lookalikes flooding every 'recommended' list and search result. Gaming apps currently make up roughly 25 percent of the iTunes store's applications, the highest of any category - which means coming up with an innovative game isn't exactly the easiest task for a developer of any size. For Kevin Chan and Nick Hagger, founders of mobile-focused indie game startup Robot Circus, innovating in the mobile space meant looking towards developing engaging titles that would serve as a social enterprise. \"We started our company in 2012, with the idea of doing a mixture of business service work that would allow us to generate revenue,\" said Hagger. \"We looked at a type of social enterprise model, making things that we feel good about and that would help improve the world. We looked to put our games in a space that we thought didn't have a huge area of competition, and that was educational games, games that could go straight into classrooms.\" Describing themselves as an \"adorable but bitter old married couple\", the Robot Circus cofounders have worked together for a long time, dating back to an Australian studio called Bluetongue Entertainment, an international arm of global publisher THQ. The pair worked within the studio from the mid 90s, working on console titles such as Jurassic Park and later De Blob. Suffering from the tailend impact of the global financial crisis, THQ closed its international offices in 2011, a move which would push Hagger and Chan to start their own business. \"That pushed us to restrategise opportunities around the mobile space. We realised we had a lot of learning it do in mobile, and we wanted to take our skills in building high quality, high production type products and bring it into a space that wasn't too oversaturated [at the time],\" said Hagger. Moving from a \"big family\" studio production team to a compact startup would hold benefits, according to Hagger, who said it enabled the pair to flex their creativity and create their \"own opportunities\". \"Projects move a lot slower there, sometimes taking two to three years,\" said Chan. \"Big studio problems come from external reasons like money and timing, while the other part of it is internal problems like personalities,\" added Hagger. Working on passion projects, however, had to fall inline with maintaining a cash flow, so the founders developed a \"process model\" that would allow them to balance client work against their own personal projects. This would mean that Robot Circus would first look to create games in the rich educational app market thanks to a grant from Screen Australia, before moving over towards other genre titles. \"I think [a balance] is particularly important if you want to make interesting things but you don't have a lot of backing to do that. For any startup that's a challenge, but it's all about maintaining cash flow and picking the projects you want to do, so you don't feel like you're interrupting the pillars you set up,\" said Hagger. \"Making an entertainment game is hard because you never really know if you're hitting the right notes, but with educational stuff we actually know what the audience can get out of it, so we can make something and really blow minds.\" Working beside the ABC, Robot Circus developed Q.E.D: Cosmo's Casebook, an interactive roman history educational game where users play as a lawyer in ancient Rome looking to solve cases. The startup also developed a music-adventure game titled Drumbeat Quest beside Holyoake, a non-profit organisation which focuses on therapeutic and learning programs through music. Robot Circus also went on to develop other educational titles including Gobbling Goblins and Spellbook Academy, which gave the cofounders an opportunity to finance their own titles, beyond the education genre. Finding an innovative game idea to work with, however, wasn't exactly straightforward, and involved undergoing a process which Hagger compared to a non-gaming tech startup finding a market niche to work with. \"It's a mixture of passion and personal; we wouldn't be doing it if we didn't like finding games ourselves,\" he said. \"You begin to think, is this a game I want to play on the go or at home, and think about the feel of the game, then started making it around that. You kind of work out making an experience that fits that feeling,\" added Chan. The startup began developing Ticket to Earth, a puzzle and role playing game designed for mobile that combines an immersive narrative with strategy. The game was released into the app market in March alongside Apple's indie game promotion, which would offer customers an exclusive section to look at indie games and help the title gain quick traction. \"There wasn't a huge amount of development in this space. This genre lets people really invest in the characters, and really get to know them over a period of time,\" said Hagger. Split into 'chapters', or portions of the game that will be released over a period of time, (an increasingly popular trend for indie games entering the market), Ticket to Earth is now pushing for a release on PC, as the Robot Circus team works to release the addition chapters into the market.

      "content": "They're our biggest trade customer and have a market economy worth more than AU$10 trillion, but China is no longer just interested in our trade. They're interested in our startups. Both the Australian and Chinese governments have actively committed to facilitating further involvement in Australian startups from China. And with our general relationship with China already worth more than AU$160 billion annually, and growing, there has never been a better time for Australian startups to connect with Chinese investors and advisors. But the question many companies will be asking themselves is how they can get their foot in the door of this lucrative market. Target areas that have a particular impact in China When it comes to technology, China is already very good at servicing consumers. Companies like Alibaba and Tencent have the B2C space covered. But for business solutions, surprisingly, China is lagging far behind. Any business will have a high impact in China if it can address the gap in China's technology market. B2B servicing in particular is one area where China is looking for new solutions and potential investments. Australian companies that can offer cross border payments and wealth management, cyber and blockchain, consumer payment and online asset management will have an advantage over their immediate Chinese competitors. Have the potential to grow overseas Already Australia has close political and geographical ties with China, which gives us an automatic advantage over our competitors in the US and UK. But for any company looking for opportunities expanding into China, it is essential to understand the geography of China's different growth industries. For example, Shenzhen is famous for Tencent and Huawei, so areas such as fintech, telecom and the IT industries are developing very well. Shanghai is the key financial hub in China, a city of investment banking, securities and managed funds. But if you're looking at potential for animation, advanced manufacturing or medical research and development, then Chengdu is the place to be. It is just as important to decide where your best prospects are in China as to decide that you want to expand to China in the first place. Be able to work under joint venture structures Being able to network with any VC is just as important as selling your messaging to them. Gone are the days where investors are happy to hand over their capital and take a step back from the business. Instead, you are now well placed to take advantage of both their business and networking expertise. With current capital control in China, institutional investors and listed companies are being cautious about their overseas investments. Areas such as direct securities, sports clubs and property investment will be harder to gain investor approval. However, investment in technology or other products and services with the potential to grow in China is still highly encouraged. This includes, but is not limited to, health products, health and aged care, education and the financial services. The important thing to remember when working with any Chinese VC is the differences when it comes to business culture between our two countries. It's no longer true that Chinese business transactions are negotiated over the dining table, but this is still a very important part of the Chinese process. What will have more of an impact on Australian entrepreneurs is the long working hours. Chinese business professionals are known for frequently working long hours and even weekends, so you may need to prepare yourself for some late night phone calls. Likewise, Chinese professionals expect a quick turn-around when it comes to communication. It is common in the negotiation process for both parties to go back to their teams and come back with a revised plan within 2 or 3 weeks. But if the discussion is serious, your Chinese correspondents may expect a response within a day or two. That's why apps such as WeChat are so popular in China; they allow for constant back-and-forth communication as opposed to emails, and are also very accessible outside of traditional working hours. Prove that you can disrupt your field There is a myth in Australia that Chinese investors are only interested in property investment. Likewise, in China, there is a misconception that because of our existing trade deals, Australia is all about iron ore, dairy and resources. It is up to you and your business to help disrupt these myths by providing in-demand technology and startup solutions that will be attractive to Chinese investors. Of course, disruptors in different industries will naturally have different characteristics. But what is important to investors is to see cost saving measures, and particularly, improved efficiency across the board. Blockchain is a good example of this; it has already saved millions of dollars for asset transactions in what is a more efficient and accurate method. Understand legal and compliance frameworks to protect IP When it comes to an understanding of legal, political, social or cultural issues around your business, protecting the IP and capital of yourself and any existing investors will be seen in good light. Chinese VC's treat overseas investment cautiously and they will investigate your company at length before going into business with you. This can be anywhere from your personal connection, to the business and the quality of your team as a whole, to the more standard features like potential for global scaling and your growth trajectory. By making sure you have all your bases covered you prove to not only be a considered investment for any VC, but will be particularly attractive to the Chinese market. The capital market in China is actively looking for advanced tech. So if any Australian business can demonstrate that they are the best in their field, they will likely see sizeable interest and potential investment from China. ",

      "content": "Sydney-based healthtech startup Whitecoat has announced the appointment of Cameron Clyne, former CEO of National Australian Bank (NAB) as its inaugural chairman.  Also the chairman of the Australian Rugby Union, Clyne served as NAB's CEO between 2009 and 2014, before retiring from the position and passing the mantle over to former Bank of New Zealand head, Andrew Thorburn. Speaking about the appointment, Clyde said he was attracted to Whitecoat for its ability to \"empower\" all Australians to grasp a firmer understanding of their healthcare providers. Beginning its run in 2013, Whitecoat is an online platform that allows consumers to search for, book and review healthcare providers. The startup was founded out of NIB Health Funds, onboarding the agency's participating general practitioners, dentists and physiotherapists.  Last year saw the business add Bupa Australia and HBF Health to its partnership network in order to reach more Australians, expanding its network to include a higher count of health practitioners and specialists.  http://www.startupdaily.net/2016/08/health-insurers-nib-bupa-hbf-band-together-expand-healthcare-provider-review-platform-whitecoat/ With over 2.2 million users to date, Whitecoat now offers consumers the ability to book and review practitioners ranging from Shiatsu Therapists to Pilates trainers. Announcing the appointment, Whitecoat's CEO Matthew Donnellan said Clyne's experience would help forward Whitecoat's agenda of shaping Australia's healthcare landscape.\n\n\"Clyne's experience and passion for improving the transparency and decision making of everyday Australians is invaluable to Whitecoat, and this will have a significant impact on the healthcare journey of millions of Australians,\" he said. Clyne, who will be bringing Whitecoat's three health funds together in the next board meeting this quarter, said he's looking forward to working with the heathtech startup. \"I am looking forward to being part of an innovative healthcare startup that allows many Australians to make better and more informed decisions about their treatment and providers,\" said Clyne. Clyne is the latest former banking executive to take a role with a startup, with former Westpac CIO Bob McKinnon last year joining Australian-founded, Singapore-based shopper engagement platform Sprooki as chairman.  NAB in February also partnered with healthtech startup Medipass Solutions to announce the development of a new platform that will integrate the bank's Health Insurance Claims and Payment Solutions (HICAPS) system. The system will look to connect patients to health practitioners online by allowing patients to view practitioners in their local area, see their availability, and book appointment times. Patients can also view the estimated cost of an appointment, as well as receive reminder notices and live updates on bookings.  ",

      "content": "Despite living in one one of the warmest countries on earth, Australians still love to complain about the cold when it start to creep below 20 degrees. While a Canadian might walk around in a t-shirt on a 14 degree day, Aussies are stacking up electricity bills by sitting in front of the TV, encircling ourselves with six fan heaters. Looking to help Australians save on their growing winter electricity bills is Reposit Power, a Canberra-based startup offering a device which allows homeowners to store energy from their solar panels on a battery and sell it back to their electricity provider for \"GridCredits\". Once it hits the billing period, a homeowner will receive a discount on their electricity bill based on how many GridCredits they've accumulated. Users are also empowered with the ability to make a 'profit' if they accumulate GridCredits worth more than their electricity bill, in which the electricity provider will decide to either pay the homeowner the difference or carry the credits over onto the next bill. For the startup's cofounders Lachlan Blackhall and Dean Spaccavento, the concept was imagined back in 2011, a time before Elon Musk's battery ideas were flooding the media and battery storage technologies were widely available. \"In 2011 and 2012 there wasn't much battery storage technology in the market, so we estimated that they'd be available in the next few years. Our estimate was right, so it was good timing,\" said Spaccavento. With experience in software and electricity, Spaccavento helped conceive the economics of what would become the Reposit Power system, before both cofounders looked for a way to control the battery storage to try and get the most out of it as possible, while factoring in the fluctuating electricity market. \"The electricity market works by providing opportunities for cheap buying of electricity and cheap consumption, and likewise expensive times to buy and consume, based on a number of factors,\" Spaccavento explained. Supported by a combination of government grants, seed funding and a scaling round, the result was an 'Internet of Energy' (IoE) device that automates the entire storage and sell-back process for the user. To ensure homeowners can capitalise on the varying energy market costs, Reposit Power intelligently calculates the best time to hold and send electricity based on factors such as weather, wholesale markets, network conditions, and temperature. \"You can consider it like a stockbroker for your power,\" said Spaccavento. \"A homeowner doesn't have the time in the day to select when to charge or discharge the battery, [so] it tries to find the best time to store and send off power.\" Homeowners, can, however, view a number of details about their IoE device and solar panel through the Reposit Power app and web platform, to allow them \"visibility\" into how the device is working and see how much money they're saving. The platform will detail how many GridCredits have been accumulated, and show how much cash they'll save on their next electricity bill as well as altogether with the device. The Reposit Power app also \"predicts\" the lowest-cost times for a homeowner to use their device, based on similar information used to calculate the energy sell times. These predictions, according to Spaccavento, will allow homeowners a chance to plan when they'll use home devices and appliances ahead of times to help them save. \"It'll inform you when to turn your high energy devices on, based on things like the time of the day where the energy costs vary. Through a push notification it will specify which time of day you should aim for. You'll also get push notifications when your battery is participating in the grid,\" he added. The physical IoE device is a small white box which attaches to a homeowner's powerbox that is connected to the internet, solar grid and a battery for storage. Batteries aren't supplied by Reposit Power, and are instead purchased from a participating solar company who will install the battery, alongside the IoE device, into a home electricity grid. Spaccavento said the business is currently partnered with a number of Australian and international solar companies who install the device and integrate it with their brand's solar panels. \"You can install reposit power anytime, although you'll need to be plugged into a compatible energy provider that will buy energy off you and allow you to save on your power bill,\" he said. Also partnering with Australian energy providers to allow homeowners to sell electricity back to the grid is Redback Technologies. The startup offers a IoE device that stores electricity from a home solar panel onto a battery, giving its users the additional option to store the energy for reuse. Another local startup focusing on energy storage for reuse is Adelaide's ZEN, which offers a storage device designed to reduce energy bills, while Sydney's Wattwatchers yesterday announced it has raised $2 million in funding to further develop its Auditor IoE product. Auditor works by attaching to a home power box and monitoring the in and out-coming power. Data supplied from the device is then able to inform homeowners what devices are sucking up the most power, thus helping them to take action to reduce power bills and the chance of blackouts. Including Reposit Power, these IoE startups are focused on targeting homeowners, a direction which Spaccavento says isn't to isolate businesses wanting to use the technology, but rather a way of following the direction of the market. \"We're marketing to homeowners because that's where all the innovation happens in the electricity,\" he said. Moving forward, the business will look to position themselves as the prominent electricity storage business in Australia and globally using their \"sophisticated, control-system focused\" technology.

      "content": "ASX-listed data intelligence company Invigor has announced today its acquisition of Singapore-based Sprooki in an all-scrip - or all-shares - deal worth a total consideration of $10 million. Four million dollars' worth of Invigor shares will be issued to Sprooki vendors, with a further $6 million worth to come subject to performance milestones. According to a statement, Sprooki is expected to add more than $2 million in revenue to Invigor in the next financial year, with a further $3 million per year to be generated in \"revenue synergies\". As part of the deal, Sprooki cofounders Claire Mula and Michael Gethen will take senior leadership roles at Mula; to be based in Sydney, Mula will be appointed COO and an executive director, with Gethen to oversee the company's Asian operations from Singapore. Sprooki chairman Bob McKinnon, former Commonwealth Bank and Westpac CIO, will also become non-executive chairman at Invigor. The startup had announced upon appointing McKinnon last year that it would be looking to raise up to $7.5 million in funding ahead of an ASX listing. Invigor chairman and CEO, Gary Cohen called the acquisition a \"transformational\" one for Invigor thanks to \"depth of talent\" the startup will bring to Invigor's board and and management ranks. It comes, he believes, at a time when bricks and mortar retailers are most in need of its solutions. \"With the imminent arrival of Amazon, something that has been much publicised in Australia recently, we have witnessed a surge of interest in data-driven digital solutions that can address loyalty, pricing, and shopper behaviour,\" he said. \"With the Sprooki acquisition, we will now have the necessary range of solutions to provide the antidote that these enterprise and SME customers need to compete more effectively in an increasingly competitive retail environment.\" Mula added that the two companies have complementary products, and therefore are together stronger and \"aligned to unlock opportunities from existing and new customers and markets\". She said, \"The growth that can be achieved from combining our services and rolling them out across three large regions, together with our joint R&D, will be a major benefit to our customers and their shoppers.\" Founded in 2011, Sprooki's data-driven platform allows retailers to engage and transact with customers through their connected devices, also allowing them to capture customer data in order to provide shoppers with a more personalised experience. Sprooki allows retailers to send shoppers location-based messages, vouches, customised product recommendations, and loyalty cards and other rewards. The startup has seen significant growth across Southeast Asia, where it's used by major shopping centres including Far East Square in Singapore and Crescent Mall in Vietnam, and brands such as Forever 21 and Marks & Spencer. It saw its first deployment in Australia at the Manly Wharf Precinct in Sydney last year. The importance of mobile in-store is strong: a report released by PwC last year found that almost 75 percent of almost 23,000 shoppers surveyed across 25 countries reported using a mobile device while in-store, with the most common uses being to compare prices with competitors, research products, access a coupon, or check reviews.

Alongside The Times Group, the round also saw contribution from existing investors 500Startups and Click Ventures, as well as new investment from Silicon Valley's Monestra Ventures and White Capital. The fresh funding brings the total raised by Oddup since it was founded by Australians Jackie Lam and James Giancotti in 2015 to US$7 million ($9.3 million). The Oddup platform aims to empower investors and researchers with detailed financial information and analysis on startups to assess whether they are, essentially, investable. It rates startups from across the globe on a scale to 100, looking at their future valuations and chances of success. With this, startups are rated as either buy, hold, or sell. Scores are based on mix of analyst input combined with data from a custom-built algorithm; Oddup's analyst team consists largely of former Goldman Sachs employees. The Series A round follows a rapid period of growth for the startup, who over the last year established partnership with Thomson Reuters to help expand its startup data offering and launched in multiple cities across South East Asia. Among its other customers are JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, and Goldman Sachs. Expanding internationally came hand in hand with Oddup releasing an updated version of its platform to support the Asian market, aiming to increase the news coverage and analytics of Asia-based startups available on the platform. Sivakumar Sundaram, CEO of The Times Group's investment arm, Brand Capital, said he is looking forward to helping Oddup set up a \"truly innovative\" startup rating system for India. \"Exactly 18 months ago we set up a team based in the Silicon Valley to facilitate, assist and showcase the India opportunity to global entrepreneurs. Oddup is such a fast growing global startup that we decided to back and lead their way into India,\" he said. Jackie Lam, cofounder and COO of Oddup, said The Times Group's distribution networks and coverage will be instrumental in furthering the startup's growth and global presence. \"This funding allows us to strengthen our research and coverage on a global scale. Our core goal remains the same and that is to help investors better understand the startups they are interested in,\" she said. ",

      "content": "Sydney-based energy startup Wattwatchers has announced that it has closed a $2 million raise from the Southern Cross Renewable Energy Venture Capital fund (REVC) to help widen the its team, reduce product costs and expand \"technology partnerships\". Wattwatchers CEO and former CIO of global smart meter manufacturer Landis+Gyr, Gavin Dietz, said the investment funds would go towards propelling the startup's flagship energy device, the Auditor. \"We will use the money to expand Wattwatchers' technology partnerships, drive down costs by dramatically increasing production volumes, boost customer support and underwrite more recruitment of skilled people to work on making energy data and control even more available,\" said Dietz. Acting as a plug-and-play energy meter, the Auditor works by attaching to a home power box and monitoring the in and out-coming power. Data supplied from the device is then able to inform homeowners what devices are sucking up the most power, thus helping them to take action to reduce power bills and the chance of blackouts. Despite the spread of renewable energy initiatives, Australian energy prices continue to rise, with a report from the Australian Energy Market Commission last year estimating that electricity bills would rise by $78 million by mid-2017. According to Dietz, increased costs means harnessing data is becoming even more important for energy customers. \"This journey starts with understanding how electricity is used in their home or business, which helps to save energy and to buy it better to cut bills. It can extend to participating in demand management schemes, right-sizing and optimising investments in distributed energy technologies like solar and storage, and trading energy with the grid and even neighbours,\" he said. Dietz added that energy companies are also at the tailend of benefiting from energy data, as they're empowered with new ways to understand and engage with their customers. \"It also can give energy markets and grid operators real-time visibility down to circuit-level, boosting their ability to respond rapidly and more effectively to electricity system crises such as summer heat wave events,\" said Dietz.

      "content": "If you've ever wondered why celebrities are constantly posting back-to-back selfies on Instagram and Facebook, the answer is, more often than not, of course, money. In fact, it wouldn't shock anyone to say that the Kardashians are filling their pockets from sponsored content, which to put a number on it, makes up 25 percent of their total income, according to a report by UK's Glamour Magazine. Aiming to facilitate connections between brand and 'influencer' in the social media market, startups such as HooZu, Tribe and Hypertape have emerged looking to take their slice of the pie. Another in the space is Perth's Zora Tech, a startup which is taking the influencer-brand relationship in a different direction through a social enterprise model and a focus on small to medium businesses (SMBs). Through MYN, a Google Chrome plugin, the startup allows social media content creators to \"tag\" products in their social media videos to connect them to a product page on a brand's website, gaining cash each time a product link is clicked. Different to existing influencer platforms, however, the average social media follower is also able to participate in the brand relationship, gaining a portion of a click-fee if they tag product on another's social video. It currently works across major video platforms including YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook. With the MYN plugin, viewers can view product tags on a video, visualised through small dots overlaying a video to point out each product, and are able to see a product's name, price and image preview by clicking to open a small sidebar tab. Products link directly a brand's point of sale page, meaning viewers are able to shop for the items they see online while watching content. Buying the products shown in media content idea was precisely where the idea for MYN came from, after one of the startup's cofounders, Callum Arnold, wanted to buy a pair of sunglasses worn by a character in the TV show Suits. Finding that there wasn't a digital solution to view the products in a video beyond sponsored links, Callum and his three brothers, Kyle, Evan, and Justin banded together to develop a product that will allow users to \"immediately consume\" what they see. Also in the minds of the brothers was finding a way to support SMBs who couldn't afford the generally costly fees - up to US$250,000 if your last name is 'Kardashian' - involved with using mainstream social influencer services. \"You could tag a product in, say, an American Youtube video to a local Perth retailer, which lets them sell their product and gain recognition to the right customer all over the globe, who is much more likely to be interested in the product, so it's very targeted,\" said Kyle. For a brand, Kyle said MYN functions similarly to Google adwords' pay-per-click model, although at a cheaper cost, with a small, flat-rate clip split between the tagger and the business. \"When a product is tagged, they're assigned to a specific brand or retailer, so when they do come in and create their own account they can control the tags,\" he explained. Brands are only charged once they sign up to the platform, and are able to \"control\" or moderate tags through a specially designed desktop app. This desktop \"dashboard\" also shows a set of analytics for the brand to visualise, while allowing them access to supply and track sponsored tags on videos. Content creators who sign up are also granted access to the desktop platform, and are able to connect their various social channels to track which tags are on their videos, the progress of any sponsored tags, and remove tags that link to incorrect products. As for the viewer, once the plugin is downloaded, they create an account before beginning to tag products, which first has to be verified by the content creator and brand. \"Tags are ranked in a hierarchy system, so the tags with the most links will appear at the top. Users can report incorrect links, while out of stock products will be marked,\" explained Kyle. Then, any cash gained from successful clicks is then added to their account's digital wallet, which can be cashed out at any time. As an alternative to shopping through viewing content, Kyle added that the startup has also developed a free app to accompany their web plugin. \"They can search through this online store using search tags to narrow down products, so they can actually see a list of products used by influencers. They can see a quick preview of where the product is tagged in the video, or actually view the entire videos. So it's essentially video discovery through product discovery,\" he said. Having entered the market with an initial MVP early last year, MYN launched its full version early this month following the raise of a seed funding round. ",

      "content": "Far too many startups approach their fundraising round in panic mode. They're not ready, their businesses are not ready, and they don't really know what they need. As a result, they're running around in desperation trying to find an investor, but not necessarily the right investor. Unfortunately, this is a situation we come across all too often. In my mind the first contact you make with an investor should not be a cold email with a pitch deck attached. Meanwhile, the following words are rarely heard: \"I would like you to get to know my company and myself before considering investment.\" So before seeking angel or venture investment, here are five questions every founder should ask, to know if their start up is ready: Is taking investment going to solve your problems? Before you even start looking for external money, ask yourself whether lack of money is really your problem. Having an extra million dollars or two in the bank may not solve the problems you are facing. Founders need to have tackled the internal problems of the business (or at least be very much aware of them and how to fix them) before going out to the market for capital. The best founders ensure their businesses are viable before approaching investors to supercharge their growth. What do I need to have in place before I begin? Well in advance of going to market, you'll need to get the basics in order. Have clear objectives, start a data room, have your legal documents prepared, do your forecasting, make sure you have the support of current investors, build your collateral and pitch deck, do your research piece, and have a board agreement in place. Most importantly, establish relationships with the investors you want to be part of the round. Get on their radar by engaging with them without having an immediate funding need. Introduce your business, keep them updated and build a rapport. It is much easier to invest in a person and a business you know well as opposed to one that has come in cold. How much should I raise? Raising too much capital too early on can hurt: it may sound counter-intuitive, but having too much cash on hand can kill a company. The pressure to spend to hit unrealistic targets, running the business down unprofitable paths to spend cash in the bank, the sudden shift from needing to run lean: all these can have a detrimental effect on a startup. Take too little and you will find yourself raising again shortly after closing one round: one month of excessive burn and next month you have no marketing money. From our standpoint, post-seed stage, the ideal amount is what you need to get you to a cash-flow positive position. By doing so you still have the option as to whether to raise again or not. When should I start the raising process? For any angel investor, having a founder call them to say, \"we only have five weeks runway left, we need help\" sets alarms bells ringing for many reasons. Some investors will want to know a startup for extended periods of time before they'll tip in money. Others will want to track your progress in a non-aggressive sales manner. Hot tip: start a monthly update email on your startup's progress and send it around to existing and potential investors. Include major milestones, client wins and any media coverage your startup has achieved. Given a standard due diligence process can take somewhere between two to three months, the sooner you can begin planning and taking action, the better. How long will it take to close the round? You're not going to close your round in three weeks - it's much more likely to be three months. Even if you have a group of investors excited about your startup, there will be a heavily involved process that will take months, not weeks, to complete. It isn't an easy process getting to know founders and their companies - and going from zero knowledge to being on board with investing takes time. Smart founders prepare themselves fully. They've planned properly; they have begun communicating and engaging with prospective investors in advance of a raise, and they've done their own due diligence. Most importantly, they also know how much they need to raise and what they want it for. This clarity and organisation gives them a much bigger chance of success when seeking funding. ",

Making the announcement on the occasion of US Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Sydney, Berejiklian said hosting the festival is a coup for the city's growing startup community and a \"great opportunity to support innovative industries and jobs in NSW\". \"NSW is the 'Startup State' of Australia, and San Francisco is the birthplace of startups,\" she said. With the rights to the festival secured by Business Events Sydney, the Sydney event next year will mark the first time the Launch festival has been held outside the United States. Founded by Jason Calacanis in 2011, the event has grown to host over 10,000 attendees each year, with around 50 startups launching at each event. Competition alumni include Fitbit, Dropbox, and Yammer. Dean McEvoy, CEO of local industry group TechSydney said he was pleased to see the state government encouraging expertise from Silicon Valley to come out to Sydney. \"Sydney's tech ecosystem is booming, it's the centre of the tech industry in Australia and we welcome the opportunity to showcase the wealth of talent we have on offer to the world,\" he said. The arrival of Launch in Australia follows that of several other big US names. Accelerator program Techstars announced in January it would be launching a defence-focused program in Adelaide, with cofounder David Cohen saying of the city, \"Not only is it ranked by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the fifth most liveable city in the world, it has been recognised by the G20 for its coordinated support for entrepreneurship. It is a tech-forward city that is building sophisticated infrastructure for startups.\" Not to be outdone, the Victorian government's independent startup body LaunchVic last month announced it would be funding the launch of 500Startups in Melbourne. The Launch news comes at an interesting time for the NSW government, following the news earlier this month that Google had pulled out of negotiations to be an anchor tenant at its proposed White Bay tech precinct, dubbed 'Silicon Harbour'. Google had entered discussions with the government to establish its new HQ at the old White Bay power station, but pulled out saying that a move into the precinct wouldn't be possible within its required \"timeframe\". A significant issue was lack of adequate public transport to the area, with a new planned metro line expected to be operational in the second half of the 2020s, leaving White Bay without public transport options until that time.

      "content": "As they say, content is king when it comes to marketing your startup or small business online, but for many business owners, trying to blog means hours of tearing their hair out trying to put their ideas and insights down on paper. Brisbane entrepreneur Cas McCullough believes she has the solution with her startup Writally, which simply asks wannabe bloggers what kind of post they are looking to write and then delivers them a step by step recipe to help them actually write it. Working with SMB owners on their marketing strategy, McCullough saw the struggle to create quality content was always a huge pain point, and began to wonder what could be done to help them overcome this. \"One day, one of my kids asked me to help them write a letter to a game developer and I realised that if I could provide a structure for a letter, I could provide one for a blog post,\" she explained. McCullough ran the idea past a few other copywriters she knew and, after mulling it over, pitched it at Brisbane coworking space Little Tokyo Two when the opportunity came up. \"I'd never pitched before and I didn't even know what an MVP was, so it was a baptism by fire,\" she said. I had quite a bit of interest from that initial pitch and was able to attract some great mentors who then helped me learn more about market validation and how investing works. Not knowing any developers, McCullough decided to offer the recipes as a service, and had customers signing on within a week. That early market validation helped her win a place in the Suncorp Small Business Challenges competition, and after going through Bluechilli's two week validation workshop, McCullough's pitch won. From there, Writally got early investment from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland, the Bluechilli Venture Fund, and private investor Scott Horton, which went towards the development of an MVP. \"Working with Bluechilli has been terrific,\" McCullough said. \"They are very supportive of diversity and as a single parent that's obviously important to me. They provide mentoring, product management and a development team, so for someone like me who is non-technical in many respects, this has made it possible to get my product into early adopters' hands more quickly.\" Being a non-technical founder, McCullough said the biggest challenges she faced early on centered on how to take \"what was essentially in my brain and create that into a product that could eventually be automated\". In looking to tackle this challenge, McCullough worked with a filmmaker to develop the methodology and story elements for the recipes with future automation in mind. She then developed the \"recipe element taxonomy\", so unique codes could be created for each of the recipe elements, such as post length, publishing platform, intro type, and type of blog post. \"The methodology we developed showed us we could take any blog post from the internet and analyse it in terms of its structure. This was an exciting discovery because, prior to that, I'd been doing the recipes by hand, paragraph-by-paragraph,\" she said. \"It changed the entire way we approached the problem and we realised that there were literally millions of different story element combinations that could be applied to any recipe.\" Another challenge for McCullough was the time commitment. She explained, \"I was homeschooling my kids at the time and running a part-time content marketing consultancy. In the end, I had to let go of a few clients and live off of savings while we developed the app. I sold my house and the kids started high school this year; a huge change for us but a lot less stressful.\"\nThe platform works by having the user fill out a quick questionnaire detailing what kind of blog post they want to create. They then have a recipe delivered to their dashboard within 24 hours; according to McCullough, this can be brought down to four hours depending on what time of day a request is made. The user can then download the recipe and start writing. \"The recipe provides step-by-step instructions that are customised to the type of post they want to create. For instance, if someone wants to write a research-breakdown post about a new government report, the structure will be very different to a common listicle-style how-to post,\" McCullough explained. With the platform in beta and helping users, McCullough said she has also learned \"a few hard lessons\", including the fact that most SMB owners find blogging overwhelming and giving them a long list of blog post types to choose from can just increase that sense of overwhelm. \"That's not what we want. We want the platform to make their lives easier and while many have been quite comfortable with the questionnaire and the choices available, we need to make sure that when we go mainstream, we've catered to those who don't know the terminology, put things in plain English so it's easy to understand and give them few options to begin with,\" she said. Heading and image suggestions were also originally included through each recipe, however the startup saw these were distracting users from getting through their first draft so they were removed and incorporated into 'pro tips' at the end of a recipe. The startup's early target market is focused on the SMB marketer who is a subject-matter expert who has already begun blogging, as well as marketing agencies working with SMB owners. McCullough has been marketing Writally itself through various social media channels and events called 'Bloghackathons'. \"I started the Bloghackathons as a way to get people testing the recipes in a supported environment where they could meet me face-to-face, so we could further refine them and learn directly from users,\" she explained. \"What's been awesome about these events is that we've been able to prove that even a first-time blogger can create a 500 word first draft in 20 minutes. This shocked even me; most people take up to four to six hours to write and publish a blog post. At our last event, a small business owner created and published his post in 40 minutes. Several participants have written blog posts within 30 minutes.\" Access to the platform currently costs $19.95 per month, with this to rise to $47 per month once out of beta. There are various types of competitors in the space, from templated solutions to copywriters, however McCullough firmly believes Writally stands apart when it comes to helping produce original content at an affordable price, while it can also be used as a tool by professionals in the space. \"Good quality copywriters are expensive. I know, because I am one...Writally can definitely be used as a tool by both professional copywriters and virtual assistants who write copy. One of my clients is doing just that. He's using the story elements in the recipe to create notes for his VA, who then puts together a first draft,\" she said. As Writally progresses through its beta, McCullough said she is gearing up for investment to further automate the app, with the incorporation of AI a possibility. Her big goal for the year, however, is to reach 20,000 users. \"That may sound like a lot, but I think it's achievable. Every new recipe we create speeds up the process for the next one, and once we automate further, improved delivery times will help us scale.\" ",

      "content": "Sydney-founded startup Tinybeans, the social platform allowing parents to share snaps of their growing children with a close network of people actually interested in seeing them, has today listed on the ASX, seeing to raise $6 million to pursue growth. Founded by Sarah-Jane Kurtini, Eddie Geller, and Stephen O'Young in 2012 with a focus on attracting tech-savvy millennial parents, the platform currently has over 570,000 monthly active users, with 1.6 million registered users. More than 150,000 new users were onboarded during the March quarter. The platform's users are based in over 200 countries, though 62 percent of users are based in the US, with 16 percent at Australia, 6 percent in the UK, and 4 percent at Canada. Geller, CEO of Tinybeans, said the company is \"thrilled and humbled\" to have achieved solid user growth recently without deploying any additional resources. \"We understand our work is only just beginning. The company has carefully planned and is deploying funds from new investors toward accelerating its strategy to deliver continued growth of the Tinybeans platform,\" he said. With over 100 million babies born every year, the startup believes its potential market is significant. Geller said, \"We are now executing on our growth strategy as we strive to realise our vision of a global nurture network, connecting more than 100 million parents and family members to the people and products their children need.\" Though it has been operating at a loss since launch, in the year to June 30, 2016 incurring a loss of $870,000, the startup has a handful of core revenue streams. As well as advertising, Tinybeans offers users premium subscriptions, and currently has 130,000 paid subscribers; it also sells printed products and services to parents based on the age and developmental stage of their child, and usage data and market analytics. User growth has come in large part thanks to the app's focus on privacy, with photos only able to be viewed by those in a user's 'Nurture Network', with a network built by a user personally inviting their family and friends. It also offers parents content and products to help in their parenting. Tinybeans took part in the first - and only - incubator program run by startup support network Pushstart in 2012. It also picked up $2 million in funding from a consortium of high net worth individuals across Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and London in 2014 and opened an office in New York. ",

      "content": "Whether it's sitting in a crammed doctor's office or juggling groceries in a line at Woolworths, the last thing anyone enjoys doing in their spare time is waiting. What's required in these situations is patience, a trait that is especially put to the test after choking on hairspray fumes while waiting for a hairdresser to trim a few hairs off your head. Looking to eliminate the physical wait time at barber shops is SLIKR, a booking app targeted at men which allows its users to enter an online queue for hair appointments. Rather than nestling into a set booking time, the startup wants to offer a more on-the-go, flexible approach for both clients and staff. Through the app, SLIKR's \"predictive queues\" gives users an estimated time as to when a selected barber will be ready for them, updating as each client serviced first enters the online queue, checks in at the store, then checks out when their appointment is over. According to the startup's founder, Duane Thompson, SLIKR serves as a way to keep the walk-in style approach a lot of barber shops prefer over the booking systems often used within other beauty services. Thompson began working on the platform over a year ago, as he looked for a way to develop a service for barber shops that didn't require set bookings. The clear downside of the the walk-in system, according Thompson, was the expected notion that there's no way for a client to track what the wait time is prior to visiting the store, or when it's a good time to visit. \"We had a look at barber shops that didn't have a traditional booking system and found there wasn't a lot out there for shops and owners. SLIKR was made to design an optimised booking system, so we avoid those fixed time slots so the shop gets the most optimised flow of people walking in. We call it queuing ahead,\" said Thompson. As the time-strapped head of a management consultancy firm, Thompson had found it difficult to find the time to get a haircut using the walk-in system of barber shops, particularly when the other option was to eat a meal after a long period of work. \"Sometimes if I did get in, I'd end up getting that dodgy barber in the corner that I didn't really want,\" Thompson joked. \"I thought it would be really cool if I could just get a place in the queue so I could get my lunch and come back. I figured if I could do that, then I could predict the wait time, something which I could put online.\" The entrepreneur added that an online product for barber shops would be fitting for the men's health beauty industry, which is on the rise as younger generations are more into \"products and looks than the older guys\". Also, existing solutions in the market for beauty services tended to have a target audience of women in mind, meaning there wasn't yet a platform aimed at walk-in barber shops. \"I was wondering if there enough people like me to make this service financially viable, so I did my research,\" said Thompson. \"For a shop, I saw a way for them to build data on their clients and staff that they couldn't previously access, and identify actual performance problems. They could then really improve their business.\" Launching the MVP in March last year, the startup looked to Thompson's local barber shop as a testing ground to help solidify the app's features, supported by two angel investors. Now in market, the app is available to barber shops, who access the platform through a \"kiosk\" set up in the store run through a tablet device, as well as through employee logins on the mobile app. As a customer queues into a store, the admin platform will update with their information, allowing the staff to digitally check them off the waiting list when they arrive in store and finish their appointment. Customers are able to download and sign up to the app for free, using location services to detect which SLIKR barber stores are within a 20 kilometre radius, or a search bar to find a particular name. Each store displays the average wait time for a haircut, with users able to tap into for more information about the store's location, reviews, and the individual waiting time for each staff member. \"The reviews are then aggregated for an overall score of the barber. Users can then check in and see updates to the queue in real time,\" explained Thompson. Queuing through the app costs a 75 cent fee, while store payments are still made at the store. Thompson said the startup is now looking to connect other beauty offerings, including nails and body services, to the platform, as the business looks to serve new locations. \"Most of the shops are here in Queensland, and we also have a couple in Melbourne and Perth. We also were recently approached by someone from Ireland who wanted a similar product there, so we're just in the final stages of getting the platform ready to distribute there,\" said Thompson. The founder added that SLIKR is also looking to leverage its platform to offer a service to beauty retail brands that will help them promote their items in stores through loyalty programs and data. To help guide the business forward, the startup recently added Ex-McDonald's Chief Information Officer for Australia and New Zealand, Henry Shiner, to its board. \"We'll [also] look to funding to take the business to the next level and work on the planned features,\" he said.

      "content": "From a standing start a decade ago, Australia's Startup landscape has grown exponentially over the last few years; there are more resources devoted to helping new Startups get off the ground than ever before, with coworking spaces, incubators, and accelerators aplenty, targeting every niche imaginable. On the surface, it may seem like all these efforts are devoted to early stage businesses, but as more of the pioneering Startups in the ecosystem mature into Scaleups, the number of initiatives out there to support them is also growing. So what exactly is a Scaleup? For Trent Bagnall, co-founder of Slingshot Accelerator, Scaleups are simply mature Startups. \"They already have revenue, customers, a product that has product/market fit, and they generally have experienced growth of 30 percent year on year; those are the minimum requirements,\" he explained. Designed to support these businesses is the AVRO Scaleup program, run by Slingshot Accelerator in conjunction with corporate partner Qantas. Qantas is running both a Startup and a Scaleup program through AVRO to address strategic opportunities it has identified for collaboration with innovative businesses. These opportunities have been grouped according to five key themes: creating seamless journeys; care beyond the air; building connected platforms; transforming for tomorrow; and innovating without limits. The Scaleup program in particular has been designed to connect corporates with a new solution that is close to ready-made to help them fix a problem within their business, or allow them to tap into new markets quickly. Bagnall explained that through the AVRO program, Qantas is looking for businesses that \"may still be in Startup-land\", but  need an incentivised partner like Qantas with a large customer base to help them scale quickly. The Scaleup program was developed after Slingshot Accelerator found that, while its Startup program does well to connect corporates with innovative products and services that might add value to their business at some point in the future, limiting applications to exclude more mature Startups also meant excluding Startups with significant potential that a corporate could work with immediately to reach a deal.  Though they may have some fine-tuning to do, Bagnall explained, a Scaleup with revenue and product/market fit is generally less in need of the services offered by an accelerator, such as advice around business modelling, branding, and pitch preparation, and more in need of a partnership deal with a corporate. Bagnall explained, \"While the Startups are still getting their MVPs done and getting product/market fit, the corporate can already start working with a group of Scaleups that are ready to go.\" Though a Startup probably adds a more \"disruptive type\" of innovation to a corporate's business than a mature Scaleup, Bagnall admitted, they are also high risk; a Scaleup with product/market fit means a higher probability of making a deal. With this in mind, the AVRO Scaleup program looks to help with the core problem facing Scaleups: the process of scaling. The goal of AVRO is to help the Scaleup and the corporate sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by the time the program wraps up. \"As Startups know, trying to deal with a large corporate can be time wasting and messy - it can be lots of maybes,\" Bagnall explained. \"There's this analogy about lots of cups of coffee; often the Startup will reach out to the corporate to say, 'I think we've got a great product', so they meet in a coffee shop and do a little demo, the corporate gets really excited, the Startup goes back and says, 'we're going to sign a great deal with this large corporate', and it turns into six to 12 months of maybes and often just fades away.\" Slingshot Accelerator calls its Scaleup program a 'Quick to No' program, with the goal to help get Qantas and the Scaleup to an MoU in five meetings or less. The form that MoU takes can vary, whether it be a white label distribution agreement to Qantas's existing customers or bringing the Scaleup on as a vendor to use its technology internally. To help both the Scaleup and the corporate get ready for this process, Slingshot Accelerator acts as a facilitator and does the heavy lifting. As Bagnall puts it, Slingshot Accelerator's skillset lies in bringing the two different forces together. \"There's a different language and culture on both sides,\" he said. Slingshot Accelerator will work with the Scaleup to ensure they have a solid value proposition for Qantas, then work with the internal business units at Qantas to ensure there is a fit and a demand for the Scaleup's offering, adequate resourcing, and KPIs associated with its onboarding. With Slingshot Accelerator and Qantas aware that Scaleups are well and truly busy running their businesses, they are able to take part in the program remotely. This participation may be different from Scaleup to Scaleup, depending on the stage of their business and what they need. \"There might be a couple of face to face meetings in Sydney, but there's no requirement to be full time or part time, so it really opens the program up to Startups and Scaleups across the country and internationally. It's a lower touch process, and we're really trying to get outcomes with the least amount of time input as possible,\" Bagnall said. Previous iterations of the Scaleup program have seen success, with healthtech Scaleup Curo Technologies a key example. Coming through the HCF Catalyst program, Slingshot Accelerator helped the Scaleup and HCF develop a commercial agreement that has seen the two work closely together over the last year, with HCF also later investing $1 million into the business. Of course, just because a Scaleup may have product/market fit, customers, and revenue doesn't mean they might not need extra assistance; those in need of a helping hand will also have access to the Avro Startup program, enabling them to tap into the wealth of skills and expertise in the mentor network. They will also have access to the full range of perks being given to participants, including $5,000 in flights redeemable from Qantas and Jetstar. Bagnall said, \"It's all about getting a real outcome at the end of the process.\" You can find out more about the AVRO scaleup program here. ",

      "content": "The Wine Gallery was founded in 2015 out of a frustration cofounder Tom Walenkamp thought he couldn't be alone in facing: understanding the language of wine is complicated. When should you have red and when is white best? Which kind of wine pairs well with what sort of meal? What's the difference between grapes? Does price really indicate quality? To answer those questions for everyone else who had them but had no one to ask, Walenkamp enlisted award-winning Melbourne sommelier Banjo Harris Plane and The Wine Gallery was born. The idea was simple - rather than replicating the liquor store experience, where consumers are presented with shelf upon shelf of wine boasting labels they don't understand, the platform would stock a strictly limited selection. Users could then browse wines according to food, tastes, season, or mood, with these core categories then broken down further according to the type of food to be enjoyed along with the wine, for example. Once these selections were made, the platform presents a couple of bottles, giving the user a little bit of information about each. \"The response was great; we could tell straightaway that there was a huge demand for a wine startup that focused on wine discovery and exploration in a non-pretentious, easy to access manner,\" Walenkamp said. According to Walenkamp, the bulk of the startup's first customers came through its Instagram account, the biggest wine-focused account in Australia. As it grew, the cofounders began seeing demand for a more extensive offering, with a subscription service at the top of the must-have list. \"Once they got to know our brand, trust our wine curation and experience our customer service they were asking if we could just send the new and exciting bottles that we thought they would like each month,\" Walenkamp said. This service was fully personalised from the start, with Walenkamp and Plane making all the individual wine selections for each member as a recommendation engine was being built in the background. As the recommendation engine now works, a user would sign on and complete a 'wine palate' quiz to start building their 'personal taste profile'. As they receive and provide their ratings and feedback on their personalised selection each month, the algorithm collects this data to influence the next month's selections. \"It works through the intelligent tagging of each bottle's individual characteristics and mapping these to the customer quiz answers and ongoing ratings of each bottle they taste. We tag each bottle with approximately 20 to 30 different characteristics, from fruit flavours to production methods and everything in between,\" Walenkamp explained. The key to this remains the selection of The Wine Gallery's full range by Plane, who also includes in each monthly box for subscribers tasting notes, the history of the winemaker, food pairing tips, and a link matching the wine to a recipe. A monthly subscription will set customers back $69 for three bottles, with $9 shipping. More than two years on from launch, Walenkamp said the breadth of subscribers the startup has brought on is diverse - perhaps reflecting the fact The Wine Gallery looks to make wine accessible to all. \"I know all the theory says you should have customer personas and target markets, but we have never managed to pin down exactly one persona. We get customers from all demographics and all walks of life from across Australia,\" Walenkamp said. \"And these days we're growing almost exclusively through word-of-mouth and friend referrals, which of course we love, because it means we can focus continually improving customer experience.\" Despite the growth of other startups in the space, Vinomofo chief among them, Walenkamp said the local bottle shop remains his biggest competition. \"Customers have been buying wine this way for decades and there's a lot inertia there [but] we provide a level of personalisation, discovery of interesting new bottles and education that just can't be catered for in your local shop,\" he said.

      "content": "One of the worst kept secrets in Australian business is out: Amazon is heading down under. After months of speculation and local retailers working themselves up into a sweat in expectation of the news, Amazon confirmed it overnight with a brief statement. \"Amazon Web Services launched an Australian region in 2012, we launched a Kindle Store on Amazon.com.au in 2013, and we now have almost 1,000 employees in the country,\" it read. \"The next step is to bring a retail offering to Australia, and we are making those plans now. We are excited to bring thousands of new jobs to Australia, millions of dollars in additional investment, and to empower small Australian businesses through Amazon Marketplace.\" The company expressed optimism that, by focusing on the things it believes customers value most - \"low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery\" - it will over time earn the business of Australian customers. No details have been revealed around the timing of the launch, though the company is actively looking for warehouse space and searching for a country manager, but of course, it's already earning solid business from Australian customers. Nielsen research released in February found that Amazon's US site converts 49 percent of Australian visitors into sales, coming in fourth behind only eBay with 78 percent, The Book Depository at 74 percent, and The Iconic with 53 percent converting. Seventy-five percent of respondents surveyed by Nielsen aged 18 or above also stated they are interested in Amazon Australia, with 56 percent saying they are likely to purchase from its Australian site and 45 percent saying they would pay to become an Amazon Prime member. The products consumers would be most likely to buy from an Australian Amazon site are electronics, books, clothes, shoes, and music, with fresh vegetables and meat towards the bottom of the list.  Industry analysts predict the effects on local retailers will be significant.  Credit Suisse predicted last month that retailers such as Myer, Harvey Norman, and JB Hi-Fi will face a \"broad-reaching\" impact, with the effects on their business models and pricing to be felt within five years of Amazon's arrival. As The Australian reported, a scenario analysis from Credit Suisse found that if Amazon were to enter the domestic market this year, Myer could lose up to 55 percent of its potential earnings before interest and tax by 2022 compared to a situation where Amazon doesn't enter. Harvey Norman's shares took a hit of 8 percent upon the release of the report.  However, for some local businesses, Amazon's arrival represents an exciting opportunity.  Ivan Lim, cofounder of online furniture retailer Brosa, believes Amazon will help grow online retailing's slice of the overall shopping pie.  \"We forget that while online retailing is growing rapidly it is still a small percentage of overall retail spend so to have one of the best online retailers entering Australia will really grow acceptance of shopping online. We're excited because the idea of shopping for furniture online becomes a lot more intuitive when more Australians are doing more of their shop digitally,\" he said. Amazon's launch is also a call to arms to local retailers to ensure they are serving customers as best they can.  \"I think businesses like Brosa that continue to sell their own unique products and brand plus offer a compelling customer experience - great last mile delivery, deep product knowledge, immersive selling experiences - beyond just selling a commoditized product will continue to thrive. That's where retailers can thrive,\" he said. Rob Hango-Zada, cofounder of logistics startup Shippit, agreed that customer experience is key and said Australian retailers understand this, however there are still issues.   \"I think that there is a distinct gap in services offered to SMBs in the Australian market, which puts them at a competitive disadvantage. Higher delivery costs, sourcing, and storage costs also means that the cost base of a small, local player is going to be astronomical compared to Amazon and this is where there is significant opportunity to improve.\" Amazon's Australian launch will be the second of an international online retail giant this year, with Alibaba opening its Australian and New Zealand headquarters in Melbourne in February. Maggie Zhou, heading up the operation, said a physical headquarters for the business locally will help ensure Australian businesses have the necessary support and information they need to grow into China. Jack Ma, Alibaba's founder and executive chairman, added that the local team will help Australian and New Zealand businesses \"share their world-famous products with billions of customers around the world\". \"Whether a large company with existing links to China or a mum-and-dad run exporter operating out of a garage, Alibaba Group is here to make it easy to do business anywhere,\" he said.

      "content": "Once a place reserved for posting shameless selfies, Instagram has rapidly shifted over the last few years to become the go-to place for brands to promote their products. Over five million global businesses look to Instagram to drive their product, with a fifth of them using paid advertisements on the platform to help spread their content. Harnessing the growth potential Instagram holds for brands is Postie, an online marketing tool which integrates a brand's Instagram content into email templates in a bid to create appealing EDMs. Postie's algorithm detects the 'best' content in a brand's Instagram feed based on factors such as likes and comments, before automatically spacing it out across an email. The platform is the first product developed by Astronaut Lab, a startup which focuses on imagining and developing products for different markets. The startup was founded by Peter Davis, who previously worked in the digital marketing space and was attracted to building his own startup after having helped build influence.co, a platform focused on connecting marketing 'influencers' to brands and agencies. \"I knew I wanted to start something in the tech space. Astronaut Lab is the studio through which we have a talented team of people collaborating around developing ideas into products that we can take to market, and then kill or spin-up based on the numbers and the numbers alone,\" Davis explained. Astronaut Lab's first product, Postie serves as a conversion tool for brands who have posted content to Instagram and are looking to draw through clicks to their website, while also serving as an extra avenue through which brands can put their Instagram content in the face of customers who may not be social followers, but email subscribers. \"With Instagram's reach algorithm, now only 20/25 percent of followers are seeing a brand's content,\" said Davis. \"Obviously Instagram also doesn't drive direct traffic from posts, so with Postie we're saying, for people who have seen your content already, this is the conversion tool, and for people who haven't yet seen it, this is your second chance to get your content out in front of your customers.\" For a customer sifting through piles of content-heavy daily emails in their inbox, Davis added that the picture-esque, aesthetic nature of Postie email offers them a \"low touch\", easily readable alternative. \"With Postie's format, it doesn't ask much of the consumer; here's our best snaps, check them out and click if there's something that grabs you,\" he said. Beginning development of Postie last year, key to the product's identity was automation, which would serve as a way to greatly reduce the amount of time brands spend on putting together an EDM filled with Instagram content at the end of a busy day. For many brands, posting content to Instagram alone can be a protracted task, involving delicate lighting setups, image editing and multiple takes to get the right shot. \"Brands put a lot of time and effort into making the output as appealing as possible, and continue to build connections and communities through [Instagram],\" said Davis. As such, the startup is targeting brands that are \"time poor\" and cannot spare the time requirement to organise regular email content using traditional marketing platforms. Currently, Postie serves kids accessory brands, restaurants, hairdressers and (completely unexpectedly) fashion brands. It's currently free for a brand to sign up to the platform, as Davis explained the business is in the process of building up a client base to discover what features they'd like to see in a premium model, and then introduce the paid version. \"Once we've worked this out and built it, we'll likely have monthly charge to access pro features that scales based on database size,\" he said. Once signed up a brand connects their Instagram account, uploads their database of images, chooses a design template, then schedules when they want their EDMs sent. Postie then integrates the most relevant and recent Instagram content into the template two days before it's scheduled to send, allowing the user a chance to make manual changes if they choose. A brand can manually add in hyperlinks to their respective web pages, and can also move images around the template and add any necessary copywriting. \"They're typically spending 15 minutes on editing their campaigns and then that's it,\" said Davis. \"[Meanwhile] we're hearing from a lot of brands that they're spending at least five hours on their Mailchimp campaigns, and it's just tough to actually find the time to do it when you need to work out what you're going to say, write it, find or create the images and then build it.\" Having bootstrapped establishing Astronaut Lab and Postie's development, Davis said the business will aim to get 5,000 users from a range of industries utilising Postie on a regular basis as it works towards its paid model.

      "content": "As Australia's big banks regroup following the blow dealt to them by the ACCC last month over their bid to collectively bargain with Apple around its Apple Pay service, Queensland-based Heritage Bank has come out with a wearable payments device that links directly to a customer's everyday transaction account. The bank has created a wrist band with an embedded Visa Paywave chip, like that on a debit card, that enables users to make contactless payments. Like using Paywave on a regular Visa debit card, purchases over $100 require the input of a PIN. The device went through a staff trial earlier this year, and has now been pushed out to 40 Heritage customers; Peter Lock, Heritage CEO, said the bank aims to launch the product to the marketplace later this year. Lock said the wristband is part of the bank's forging a path as a \"digital pioneer\" in the Australian banking sector. \"As well as our new wearable device, we've also developed our own mobile phone contactless payment app, have just released a newly updated internet banking platform, and we're currently upgrading all of our branches with new more digitally-focused designs,\" he said. This is just the latest wearable payments device Heritage Bank has released over the last few months, with the bank working with Sydney fintech startup Inamo and Visa to last year release the 'Curl', a wristband enabling contactless payments, and the 'WaveShades' payment sunglasses prototype earlier this year. The Curl and WaveShades enable users to load money into an account, with Heritage the Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI), holding all monies loaded onto the devices and overseeing settlement as they are used and reloaded. Elsewhere in the mobile payments space, Westpac has officially partnered with Samsung to offer Samsung Pay to its Mastercard and Visa debit and credit cardholders. Richard Fink, vice president, Mobile Division at Samsung Australia said, \"We know Australians use their smartphones every day to enjoy content, stay connected and organise their lives. Partnering with Westpac will bring the security and convenience of Samsung Pay to millions of Australians.\" George Frazis, Chief Executive Consumer Bank at Westpac Group, added, \"Customer behaviour is changing all the time and the growth of mobile banking in the past three years has been exponential. Our strategy is to be where our customers are.\" Westpac was one of the banks in the group denied the right by the ACCC to negotiate with Apple as a collective, joined by the Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. The banks had sought permission to bargain as a group with Apple for access to the Near-Field Communication (NFC) controller in iPhones in order to offer their own digital wallet services to customers rather than integrate with Apple Pay. According to the ACCC, the banks argued that offering their own digital wallets would lead to increased competition and consumer choice in digital wallets and mobile payments in Australia; increased innovation and investment in digital wallets and other mobile apps using NFC tech; and greater consumer confidence, leading to increased adoption of mobile payment tech in Australia. However, the ACCC argued that giving the banks the rights they sought could impact Apple's ability to compete with Google as it would affect Apple's \"current integrated hardware-software strategy for mobile payments and operating systems more generally\". With this verdict, the banks stated they would individually review their digital wallet strategies. ANZ, Macquarie Bank, and ING have already signed on to Apple Pay. ",

      "content": "Recruitment seems like it may be one of the most disrupted sectors in Australia, with dozens of startups seemingly coming at it from every angle imaginable. The latest to make its way onto the scene is Melbourne's Weploy, founded by Vince Luong, Nick La, and Tony Wu to connect pre-screened employees to employers who need short term staff, on-demand. As La tells it, he and Luong were both running their own businesses before Weploy, La a recruitment company and a few hospitality venues and Luong an ecommerce company. Though working in different in different industries, they faced similar issues around staffing and recruitment. \"We got talking about our frustrations one night over drinks and it dawned on us that the issue affected millions of people across different industries and a better recruitment method should and could exist through technology,\" La explained. With his background in recruitment and Luong's experience in digital, the idea for Weploy was born. The team approached the development of the platform by considering their experiences as both employers and job seekers, with their aim to create a process that required the least amount of work while, of course, producing the best result for both parties. A jobseeker, or 'Weployee', can sign up online, with this onboarding process involving psychometric and skills test. If they pass these, they then go through an interview and safety checks, including police and ID checks. Once approved and fully onboarded, a Weployee can get job offers matching their skills, rating, and geographic location directly to their app, which they can accept or decline. Interestingly, a Weployee is technically employed by Weploy rather than the individual employers, with the startup paying them 10 percent above award wages and super, and covering work insurance. \"It is really important to us that we nurture a very high quality community of Weployees as a differentiating point in the market,\" La explained. \"A lot of the current competitors are too driven by profit margins, meaning the employee and client are inevitably neglected. We wanted to create a service that produces a win-win scenario, so we set our rates at 10 per cent above average to attract the best talent and set our margins lower so employers are better able to access these skills.\" An employer, or 'Weployer', meanwhile, can log onto the platform on mobile or desktop and within a few clicks make a request for a staffer. La explained that suitable Weployees will be notified based on the job requirements, with those notified able to accept the job in a first in, best dressed model. According to La, the average acceptance time is 33 seconds. On the job seeker side, Weploy is looking for talented individuals wanting flexible work. With uni students a key demographic here, the startup has partnered with Melbourne's RMIT to get word out to its community, and is also in talks with other universities. Employers, meanwhile, are mainly medium to large-sized businesses in need of temp staff fast, though La said smaller businesses are also coming on board to find Weployees to support growth. Given the nature of the model, the key industries are, as one might expect, admin, hospitality, retail, and the labour sector. Following a pilot in Melbourne, employers on the platform include RMIT, Vice Australia, and General Assembly. Weploy's development was funded thanks to an initial $400,000 seed investment from Van Luong, founder of the Viet-Uc Seafood Company; this was increased to $1 million following the startup's pilot phase, with Weploy also adding ex-Redbubble CTO Paul Coia and Rotten Tomatoes cofounder Patrick Lee to its advisory board. La sees Weploy's competition as the traditional recruitment agency model, however there have been a number of other startups emerging with the on-demand temp model over the last few years. One of the more established players in the space is Sidekicker, allowing businesses across the hospitality, admin, promotional marketing, and events spaces hire pre-screened staff on an hourly or daily basis. Founded in 2012, the startup last year secured a strategic investment from jobs platform Seek. WorkNinja, meanwhile, emerged in 2015 to connect hospitality businesses to staff on-demand, giving employers access to a live tracking system to see staff on their way after they have accepted a shift and GPS-enabled clock-ons, while Workfast launched with the on-demand model late last year looking at a variety of industries. Workfast launched giving the ability for job seekers to book jobs as contractors with their own ABN, or sign up as Workfast employees. Now live in Melbourne, Weploy is currently piloting in Sydney and looking at expansion into other states. ",

      "content": "The 457 visa, or the temporary work visa allowing skilled workers to work for an approved business in Australia for up to four years, is to be abolished, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced today. In a video announcement posted to Facebook, Turnbull said that while Australia is \"the most successful multicultural national in the world\", Australian workers \"must have priority for Australian jobs\".  \"We will no longer allow 457 visas to be passports for jobs that could and should go to Australians,\" he said.  While acknowledging that businesses must have access to the \"skills they need to grow and invest\", Turnbull said the 457 visa will be replaced by a new temporary visa, specifically designed to recruit the \"best and brightest\". \"The new visa will better target genuine skills shortages, including in regional Australia. It will include new requirements, including previous work experience, better English language proficiency, and labour market testing,\" he stated. Existing 457 visas will be honoured, but the list of qualifying occupations for the new two-stream visa will be cut by more than 200. Among the cut occupations are ICT support and test engineers and web developers. A new short term two-year visa, which will not allow for permanent residency, will be introduced, while a new medium term visa, for \"more critical skills shortages\", will run for four years. The permanent residence pathway or eligibility period under the medium term visa will be extended from two to three years, while under the reforms employers sponsoring foreign skilled workers will also be required to provide \"enhanced training outcomes\" for Australians in high-need industries and occupations. The government had introduced initial reforms to the 457 visa last year, with Minister for Immigration Peter Dutton cutting back the number of days a visa holder can stay in Australia while in between jobs from 90 to 60 days. Dutton had also said the government would look to cut down on the number of occupations eligible for the visa. Today's announcement has been met with a mixed from the startup community, which has had a long-standing focus on attracting international talent and a reliance on the 457 visa; 9,111 have been granted to software developers since 2014.\n Tank Stream Labs CEO Bradley Delamare, who came to Australia on a 457 visa sponsored by Ernst & Young and is now a citizen, believes the level of burden involved for sponsor companies is already high and that changes will make it even more difficult for startups to find talent to help them compete globally.  While he hopes the new temporary visa will be attractive to international talent, he believes the focus on Australian jobs for Australian workers is problematic.  \"Peter Dutton said one of his key goals in abolishing the 457 as it currently stands is to stop international workers on these visas from becoming permanent residents down the line,\" he said. \"There are a huge number of creative and savvy migrants who are not just working for large companies on their visas, but have eventually gone on to launch their own small businesses and startups. We want these kind of innovators to continue to make Australia their home.\" Also concerned was Anna Rooke, CEO of QUT Creative Enterprise Australia (CEA), who described the announcement as \"at odds\" with Australia's goal of building an innovation-driven and flexible economy that can respond to the need of businesses.   \"The uncertainty and lack of clarity on the process for 457 visas and the new temporary visas that have been flagged is placing companies in a difficult situation on the implications and timing for changes,\" she said. \"For instance, at CEA we have specialist positions that our startups, and ourselves as an accelerator, have recruited overseas for because of shortages in specific technical skills in Australia. The implication that this announcement may jeopardise those workers, and the startup community more generally, is a significant issue until greater clarity is provided.\" For Julius Wei, cofounder and Head of Investment Analysis at BMY Group, the announcement mainly reflects Australia becoming more \"protectionist\" in its policies, rather than inciting massive economic change, with Wei adding that the abolishing of the visa will only impact a small portion of Australia's workforce. \"457 visas represent a very small portion of the overall workforce, and are already designed to help businesses hire skills that local employees don't already have. Saying this policy is putting Australian jobs first is a misnomer as it actually won't provide much more in the way of Australian jobs anyway,\" he said. Adding that there's no need for \"panic\" as a new and potentially better policy will take the place of the current visa system, Wei acknowledged the issues of Turnbull's Donald Trump-like approach to delivering the announcement via a short Facebook video message. \"But without providing details of what that new policy is, the cancellation of 457 visas leaves the impression that Australia is shutting its doors to foreign workers. For a country built upon migration this is a poor approach; we rely on overseas markets and investments and should be welcoming newcomers, not rejecting them,\" said Wei. Growing Australia's innovation economy through international talent was a key recommendation in last year's StartupAUS Crossroads Report, which highlighted ways to help shape Australia's startup ecosystem global competitiveness.  In addition to establishing a program to attract international startups to move to Australia, the report also recommended the implementation of an Entrepreneur Visa, which would offer international startups an accessible and appealing path to conducting their business down under.  While key for the tech industry, the 457 visa has come under fire from unions and other worker's groups over the years, with concerns raised around both the exploitation of foreign workers and the both research and Australians missing out on jobs. The issue of exploitation is of particular concern in the hospitality industry, with a number of reports emerging over the last few years of workers being mistreated. According to The Conversation, a survey of employers conducted in 2012 found those in the hospitality industry are 13 times more likely to prefer workers on a 457 visa than similar Australian workers, with over 15 percent of 457 visa workers employed in hospitality. Only 42 percent of respondents in the hospitality industry stated \"they have filled skilled job vacancies\" as a result of sponsoring 457 visa holders, compared to 52 percent of employers across all industries, with 41 percent said they had \"increased loyalty from 547 workers\" as a result of the visa, compared to 19 percent of all employer respondents. The rolling out of the new visa will begin immediately and is set to be completed by 2018. ",

      "content": "Sydney-founded online education startup Smart Sparrow has announced the closing of a US$4 (AU$5.3) million Series C round led by OneVentures to expand its design-based technology to cater for the growing number of students taking online courses in the US. OneVentures was joined by Uniseed, both returning investors, and new contributor Moelis Australia Asset Management, the investment arm of Aussie industry research firm Moelis Australia. The closure of the round brings the total raised by the startup to date to US$16 (AU$21) million as it looks to solidify its product offering following its expansion into the US market roughly two years ago. The startup has also received grants from NASA and the US Department of Defence, as well as a $4.5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Founded in 2008 by Dror Ben-Naim, a researcher at the University of New South Wales, Smart Sparrow offers teachers and university professors an online platform where they're able to design their own online course content to create an interactive and 'adaptive' learning experience for students. Educators are able to integrate tutorials, interactive content, simulations and media into their course, which can be edited at any time. Course creators are then able to view student's progress in real-time and visualise course data. The platform isn't limited to the subject of content either, as Smart Sparrow is built to support a broad range of learning facets including engineering, business, science, music and medicine, amongst others. The business services over 8000 educators globally, having formed partnerships with Sydney edutech OpenLearning and Victoria's Deakin University, as well as securing clients within Arizona State University, Columbia University and Stanford University. With a growing client base, the startup will look to meet the increase of US students taking online courses, a group which grew by nearly six million last year. According to a survey pinning online education numbers in the US, currently more than quarter of all students take at least one online course subject, as universities move to hire more online course designers to keep up with the demand. As such, it's expected that online course design jobs, or 'instructional designer' roles, will grow as much as 20 percent in the coming decade. Speaking about the funding round, Managing Director of Moelis Australia, Ben Wong, said the firm is looking forward to supporting the next generation of students completing online courses through Smart Sparrow. \"Smart Sparrow technology presents an exciting opportunity to reimagine the way we learn. We see broad-based applications for the technology, and we're excited to support their work to inspire the next generation of students,\" said Wong. Ben-Naim added that the platform's success represents edutech harnessing the interactive and accessible functionalities typically found in consumer apps. \"Education technology is, for the first time, borrowing concepts familiar from consumer apps to simplify the process for faculty to create high-quality, engaging courses that draw upon the best of pedagogy and practice,\" he said. \"Just like PowerPoint and Photoshop made it possible for anyone to create an engaging presentation or graphic, our platform enables the development of courses that taps the best of technology to engage students, without sacrificing pedagogy.\" ",

      "content": "Melbourne fintech startup Assembly Payments has announced today the city will serve as its global headquarters as it gears up to hire more than 60 new team members over the next 12 months. Founded in 2013, the startup formerly known as PromisePay has already brought on former Xero marketing director Kylie Kneale and Julia Bearzatto, previously tech lead at IBM and CPO of SecurePay. With 64 employees spread across its offices in Melbourne, Sydney, Manila, and St Louis, Assembly was exploring the idea of heading offshore before the Victorian government offered support in the form of a cash grant. Simon Lee, CEO of Assembly, said that while the company has a global team, it is committing to make Melbourne its biggest base. \"The local ecosystem and environment are hugely important to us. We think Melbourne has the potential to be one of the most important financial technology centres of the world; it's one of the most diverse, creative and forward thinking cities in the region, and those are the exact traits we search for in our people, so we think some of the best tech talent in the world can be found right here at home,\" he said. Lee added that the startup doesn't see staying put rather than heading overseas as \"a sacrifice\". \"Silicon Valley companies sell all round the world, as can we. A couple of years ago people would ask why we don't move to San Francisco or London, but now we're seeing other Aussie tech companies build international offices but keep HQ at home, so it's becoming more normal.\" It comes just a few months after the startup signed a deal with the eBay-owned classifieds platform Gumtree to power its Gumtree Connect platform. The service will enable customers to post jobs for tradies, who will then submit quotes, with Assembly taking care of the payment side once a job is done. Gumtree is one of more than 100 companies using Assembly globally, with the likes of Carsales, Airtasker, and hipages also customers. Described as a flexible payments platform, with client companies able to manage things like escrow and fraud detection, the startup last June raised $14 million in a Series A round led by Carsales, with participation from other investors including Rampersand,Westpac's Reinventure, and 99Designs cofounder Mark Harbottle. Assembly is just the latest company to get support from the Victorian government to base itself in Melbourne. The government has over the last few years splashed the cash to get global names including Zendesk, Square, and Slack to open offices in the city; Melbourne-founded logistics software startup GetSwift also returned down under after a stint in New York thanks to a push from Victorian Minister for Innovation Philip Dalidakis. Chairman Bane Hunter said at the time, \"We met with [Dalidakis] in the US, where he delivered a pretty compelling pitch as to Melbourne should be our first choice for a move back home.\" Taking a slightly different approach to luring companies to its state is Queensland with its Hot DesQ program, which offers international startups and Australian startups outside Queensland a grant and free coworking space to relocate to the state for six months.

      "content": "Unless visiting the trustworthy local Thai restaurant that's been your go-to for years, the odds are that when looking for a tasty meal you'll resort to technology to tell you where is best to eat and how to get there because, let's face it - your phone has a better chance of figuring out your cravings than you do. Restaurant discovery apps such as Yelp fill our location-based food searching needs while out and about, while platforms like OpenTable help us book a table before it's snatched away by hungry competition. Also looking to carve its way into the foodtech space is Feedmee, a social enterprise restaurant discovery and booking platform which donates a portion of each booking referral fee to charity. Looking to feed communities in need using an 'eat out, give back' model, each donation goes directly to OzHarvest to pay for a meal of a disadvantaged person, with the startup stating it has covered the cost of roughly 1879 meals since its entrance into market six months back. For Feedmee's founder, Tyler Spooner, developing the app meant giving back to the charities which helped support him while growing up, his aim to help others now facing similarly difficult conditions. \"I became an orphan at the age of 10 and grew up in foster homes. In my early years I spent some time on the streets and relied heavily on charities for food and support. Coming from this background, I've always wanted to help people that are in the hard situation I faced growing up,\" he said. This led to the idea for Feedmee, which Spooner describes as a \"plate for plate movement like Zambrero, but not for just one restaurant but the whole world\". Spooner began development of the app last year, making his way into the Plus Eight accelerator in Perth earlier this year. With $40,000 in seed funding from the accelerator, he said he took his time to create a discovery system that would help \"maximise customer conversions\" and differentiate Feedmee from its competitors. To match its users to restaurants related to their food interests, the Feedmee app uses an artificial intelligence algorithm named 'Olly', which takes an individual's \"taste preferences\" into account to narrow down the search, according to Feedme's founder, Tyler Spooner. \"Olly's 'brain' is powered by...clustering algorithms that match individual users [based on] socioeconomic data, geospatial information and behavioural patterns to optimise which dishes are presented to the users,\" explained Spooner. In layman's terms, once logged in through either email or social media, a hungry user is presented with a single \"meal\" from a restaurant on the app interface, showing a picture of the meal, its price tag, and the restaurant's name and location. Embracing the mechanics of dating apps like Tinder, if a user likes what they see, they swipe right to 'favourite' a meal or left to 'reject' it. Tapping on a meal will bring up more a detailed profile page about the restaurant, including reviews, opening times, location, menu, and a link to call the restaurant to book a table or reserve a space online. The interface also offers a direct link to Uber, to help find a driver to take the customer to the restaurant. Once a user swipes through a handful of meals, Olly can then begin to recommend restaurant choices that a user is more likely to enjoy. The AI, according to Spooner, also takes into account the price range the user prefers, as well as where they tend to eat by tracking their selection through Feedmee. According to Spooner, using AI offers a more automated and accurate discovery method alternate to the popular manual search and category preferences traditionally used by food discovery apps in the market. A user, however, can manually narrow their search based on dietary requirements, search distance, and price range. \"Olly can generate deep insights into the trends underpinning what customers want to eat, when they want to eat it, where they're eating, and their dining budget. Using this information, Feedmee can help restaurants and cafes to focus their offerings at the right customers, at the right time and at the right price,\" he said. If a restaurant offers delivery, a customer is able to also order a meal through the app and organise for delivery. Either way, the restaurant will be charged a referral fee for successful conversions through the app, which is then split between the startup and the donation for OzHarvest. Aside for harnessing Olly's data, the benefit for a restaurant on the platform, according to Spooner, is being able to give back to the community in a direct and simplistic way. \"We've spoken to around 50 restaurants in Melbourne that like what we are doing, and would work with us as a way to give back to the community,\" he said. Currently, Feedmee is connected to roughly 250 restaurants across Perth and Melbourne, with Spooner looking to raise $500,000 in the coming six months months to expand across the rest of Australia and into the US.

      "content": "Global cannabis software and point of sales solutions company Guardian Data Software (GDS) has announced a partnership with Australian medical cannabis accelerator BuddingTech that will see the organisation act as an analytical engine and business consultancy for GDS clients, while working towards new research initiatives. BuddingTech, a Sydney-based organisation which emerged in 2015, identifies startups working with cannabis technology and research, and looks to support them towards commercialising their ideas for the Asia Pacific medical cannabis market. Besides the accelerator, BuddingTech also offers consultation services, and holds a medical cannabis resource database filled with surveys and analytical white paper reports. Under the new agreement, which was penned at Israeli cannabis innovation conference, CannaTech Israel, GDS clients will be able to leverage the startup's analytical research and consultancy services, allowing the company to expand its service offerings. The companies will also work together to launch new educational and research programs regarding botanical and medical cannabis, as well as look into identifying new areas where they can acquire industry data to empower their ability to serve cannabis businesses, in addition to the financial and government sectors. Guardian Data Software's CEO, Lance Ott, described the partnership as a \"win-win\" for both companies, saying BuddingTech will also benefit from leveraging GDS' wide framework of data to improve the accuracy and detail of its analytics and reports. \"With medical cannabis sales projected to grow from $4.7 billion in 2016 to $13.3 billion in 2020, we believe BuddingTech has a great deal to offer our customers who are hungry for data and additional business support,\" he said. Ott added that GDS looked to BuddingTech as a \"logical\" partner as both companies have achieved an international market presence, each growing within Europe, Israel and other regions outside of the US. As for Australia, BuddingTech CEO Adam Miller said the country is \"uniquely positioned\" to become a leader in botanical and medical cannabis research. \"Within less than two years, the Australian government has developed a federal framework to support the domestic cultivation and manufacturing of medical cannabis. Australia is now uniquely positioned to become a leader in the field of botanical and medical research; data will play a vital role to support the developing industry,\" he said. Since October last year, the use of medical cannabis for patients with chronic or painful illnesses became legal under the Narcotic Drugs Amendment Act, with the drug being supplied through both a Victorian cultivation site and import into Australia on a case-by-case basis. While local cultivation looks to increase to meet medical demand, a new scheme recently approved by the Federal Government aims to improve accessibility by fast tracking importation from overseas sources. While the government works on a temporary accessibility solution, the startup sector has looked towards navigating the regulatory, technological and logistical frameworks surrounding medical cannabis. Last year saw the University of Sydney host Australia's first ever pitch event for innovative medical cannabis technology, dubbed 'Seedlings', to support startups working with medical cannabis tech. The event, moderated by BuddingTech, looked at identifying startups addressing issues in the area of education, patient interaction, and clinical research. ",

      "content": "It's 2006, and Australia's game development landscape is brimming with both local and global talent. Among the big players is international gaming giant Sega, a company which gained enough traction to open up its own baby theme park in Sydney's Darling Harbour. Enter the global financial crisis, a torrential wave which would bury Sega and, alongside it, nearly the entirety of Australia's game development businesses. From the ashes rose small independent or 'indie' developers, startups that are now leading the charge towards rebuilding an industry that was once a contender on the global stage. Now, indie developers make up the majority of Australia's gaming sector, a $115 million industry expected to grow thanks to the high export numbers generated from new and veteran startups in the space. According to Nicole Stark of Disparity Games, the rise of indie devs can be attributed to the \"perfect storm\" of unemployed developers left behind from the wreckage of the global financial crisis, in combination with the increase of mobile gaming opportunities. \"The rise of mobile [brought] a lot more casual gamers, so people who wouldn't normally play games, the average person, was now a part of the market,\" she said. Mobile games and the nature of their development, according to Stark, presented a ripe opportunity for talented developers to start their own businesses and begin creating. Mobile games are generally smaller in scale, easy to distribute, and require less resources and time to create, and thus they are overall cheaper. Stark herself took up the mantle to create her own game alongside her husband, Peter, with the both of them having spent time working within the gaming industry. The pair began working together in 2011, when Stark was on maternity leave while her husband took long service leave. \"We thought hey, let's start making a video game,\" she said. The pair developed their first title, Run Fatty Run, a mobile platforming game where a player must navigate obstacles while getting chased by a tiger, and established their startup, Disparity Games. Their full time roles took a backseat, with the couple splitting the work on development between them: Peter focused on programming and Nicole on design. However, beside the huge intricacies of game development, the couple had to also juggle all the typical facets of, well, starting up a startup, without a source of income. \"It [was] absolutely terrifying,\" said Stark. \"We had no steady job, a mortgage to cover, and four children. To go from earning money to watching your bank account dwindle is really tough.\" Jumping between different roles served as a double-edged sword for the entrepreneur, who described it as \"crazy\" yet \"exciting\". \"To be honest I still get sick of how many hats I have to wear. Every time you swap hats you have a little bit of inertia. It's the best job in the world, but also the most strenuous,\" said Stark. Developing titles wouldn't just involve the efforts of the couple, however, but the entire family, consisting of four daughters from ages eight to 24. Stark explained that their 20 old daughter, who is studying animation, works for the business a few days a week, while the youngest is learning programming. \"We're really a family indie development company; the mom and pop store of indie game development,\" joked Stark. The family operates at their residence just a flicker away from the sea in Noosa, as Stark talked about the ups and downs of working as a family business. \"When it's great it's very very great. There was certainly an adjustment period at the beginning though, because you go straight to spending all your time together,\" she said. The later half of 2015 saw Disparity Games release their flagship IP title, Ninja Pizza Girl, a colourful action-platformer with bullying and teenage angst at its ideological heart. The title was met with substantial critical and financial success, having earned high reviews scores across the board. With their commercial success, the startup now sits as one of the leaders of Queensland's gaming sector, a tight-knit community compacted with other indie developers. With an increase of startups entering the space in both Queensland and Australia-wide, Stark said it's a sector she hopes that will continue to diversify. \"I think there's space for people to do things a lot of different ways, which is what we're seeing at the moment. You have your micro AAA indie developers, then a lot of smaller sized ones too,\" she said. These 'micro AAA' developers are the startups looking to fill the gaps left behind from the global financial crisis. According to Stark, there's businesses now face a new challenge, involving the oversaturation of genre games, particularly in mobile, due to lack of diversity and copying from international competitors. Stark, however, is confident the industry will move forward. \"As the barriers decrease, there will be more companies popping up. There's so much innovation in the indie game scene, so there will always be new ideas coming about in one way or another,\" she said. Currently working on contract work including a title called 'Younger: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles', Disparity Games is looking towards developing its next IP game, a parkour platform dubbed 'Snapdragon'.

      "content": "Financial advice startup Moneysoft has partnered with Mortgage Choice to produce and launch MoneyTrack, a financial planning tool to be made available to its network of advisers through its cashflow coaching service. Tania Milnes, general manager of Mortgage Choice Financial Planning, said the tool will provide a \"robust basis\" for the advice it currently provides. \"It gives clients an easy to understand tool that provides a clear picture of their spending and saving habits and helps steer the conversation around achieving their financial goals,\" she said. The platform will also boost efficiency for advisers, added Jon Shaw, head of technology and commercial operations at Moneysoft. \"Our technology features straight-through processing which cuts down on manual data entry, delivering time savings to advisers while also enabling them to develop a greater understanding of their clients' individual financial circumstances,\" he said. Launched by former accountant and financial adviser Peter Malekas in 2012 and having raised $1.5 million in funding from backers including BlueChilli, Moneysoft was built with financial professionals in mind including, among others, financial advisers and planners, mortgage brokers and aggregators, and super funds. Its Moneysoft Pro platform enables users to provide clients with cash flow, budgetary, and money management services by bringing together a client's accounts, loans, mortgage and any other products into one view, while its Individuals platform allows users to link all their accounts, set money goals, and track their progress. With Mortgage Choice on board, Moneysoft stated its customer base of financial advisory and dealer groups has now grown to 10. The partnership follows another with Link Group, provider of fund administration solutions, announced a few months ago, with the companies to work together on new products for super fund members. In the five years since the startup's launch, the number of tech players offering financial advice has exploded; robo-advice for the consumer has become a particularly popular segment, with the likes of Stockspot, Acorns, and HashChing just a few working in the space. Facing disruption, however, some in the financial planning space have come to embrace tech tools to better enable them to serve their clients. Joining Moneysoft with a solution aimed at this market is myprosperity, which recently announced former managing director of Xero Australia, Chris Ridd as its CEO, with MYOB cofounder Craig Winkler an investor. The platform has developed an online solution to help accountants and advisers better work with their clients. ",

      "content": "As the announcements coming out of Fairfax and News Corp have shown again over the last week, the media industry has been in a bad way for a while. Heather Catchpole and Karen Taylor weren't swayed by the difficulties facing the industry, though; after being made redundant from science magazine Cosmos in 2013, they decided to have a go at launching their own publishing company, Refraction Media, producing STEM-focused content. \"We both felt like an amazing opportunity was presenting itself to us and we would be crazy to ignore it. We had confidence in our abilities because we'd been doing the exact job as a team for two years where we'd worked for a science magazine,\" Taylor explained. The pair were similarly confident with their choice of focus, with their background in science publishing - and the \"mountain of contacts and supporters\" that came with it - setting them in good stead. Beyond that, they saw a real need for STEM content. \"We had seen the reports that showed a massive gap between STEM skills and employer demand. We believed that a big part of the problem was around perceptions and stereotypes around STEM careers. Kids in school imagined scientists in the white lab coat, glasses and facial hair,\" Taylor said. \"STEM had an image problem and we believed storytelling and connecting with audiences is a great way to transform its image. We also knew that STEM skills were increasingly important as a business strategy for organisations.\" The company produces a variety of magazines, websites, posters, teaching guides, and even apps to encourage students into STEM. Its cornerstone publications are the Careers with STEM magazines, a series of career guides produced in partnership with Google for high schools. The series looks at specific niches within STEM with titles including Careers with Code, Careers with Engineering, and Careers with Science, profiling professionals to showcase the different types of jobs in these sectors. It all kicked off with the pair bringing on their first client within a couple of weeks of coming up with the idea with Refraction; in fact, they had yet to open a business bank account. They had worked with the client at their old job, but with the freedom that comes with running your own company, were able to pitch \"some wonderfully creative concepts\". \"I think we were successful because we knew the topic, we were familiar with the way the organisation worked and we were willing to put ourselves in the centre of the production process while driving the creative process. We were ambitious and keen; we grabbed the opportunity with both hands,\" Taylor explained. The growth of Refraction Media has been helped along by the increased interest in STEM over the last few years as the realisation dawns that the vast majority of Australians are unequipped for the jobs of the future. According to statistics released by PwC in 2015, around 75 percent of fast-growing occupations require STEM skills but only 16 percent of high school graduates pursue degrees in STEM disciplines. \"Stakeholders have realised that it makes business sense to connect with groups that have previously been underrepresented in STEM, like women and cultural minorities, and our messaging has always been about driving diversity in STEM,\" Taylor said. Refraction is working with organisations including Commonwealth Bank, Telstra, and Atlassian, companies Taylor said are keen to be part of the solution and use the publisher's platforms to connect with girls. \"I think the really progressive tech companies are being quite active in this space. I think the key is that there should be a focus on collective impact. At the end of the day, we are trying to create a larger talent pool. We are trying to encourage companies to focus collectively to make a better impact on diversity, rather than having individual programs scattered around,\" she said. To reach a wider audience via a central platform, Refraction has also developed CareerswithSTEM, a website bringing together stories from across corporate Australia, government, higher education, and startups to inspire readers and show the breadth of opportunity in STEM. \"At Refraction Media, we want to smash those gender and cultural stereotypes and show secondary students, and particularly young women, that working in computer science does not mean you'll be in a basement coding in the dark,\" Taylor said. To demonstrate this, the cofounders ensure that there is a minimum of 50 percent female representation in each publication produced by the company, going with the idea that you can't be what you can't see. \"We want to challenge the perceptions about tech careers and highlight the unexpected outcomes. In reality, there is a lot of flexibility around your work conditions if you're working in tech, so it is particularly well-suited to women who may have to combine other caring needs, for example,\" Taylor said. The company last year expanded the Australian edition of Careers with Code to include New Zealand with the support of Google, delivering 50 copies to every school across Australia and New Zealand. Work in the US is also in the pipeline following the production of a pilot edition of Careers with Code for the US last year, while Catchpole and Taylor also hope to expand to Asia. ",

      "content": "The goal for many an entrepreneur starting out with a new business is, of course, to build a thriving venture where they get to do what they love every day. For some of those who make it, however, there's often a particular detail that doesn't make it into the well-rehearsed story to tell friends and clients about running your own business: just how much of a slog it can be. This was certainly the case for Siobhan Komander, who founded events agency Xphyr Brand Experiences in 2004 with \"a laptop, no clients, and a name only an owner could spell\". Having worked for companies including APRA, Sony, and the Sony Foundation before launching her own business, Komander was able to attract big name clients including Google, Spotify, and Twitter. With offices in Sydney and Singapore, Xphyr turned over around $20 million in 2016, certainly fitting most definitions of thriving - but Komander was \"a mess\". \"I was stressed, I was anxious, my diabetes wasn't under control, and I had absolutely no life. I was, for all intents and purposes forced to really make some changes to my life, one of the key things being moving from a very manual business to a more automated one in the long term,\" she explained. \"I love working with clients and doing events, but it was time to pull back on the volume and size I was doing.\" In thinking about her health, Komander began to consider what she was putting inside her body, from food to tampons, and it was here that her idea for Liverpool St, a service delivering organic tampons monthly, came to life. Komander felt so passionately about the idea that, along with scaling back Xphyr, she pumped $40,000 into the new business, which aims to address two main issues: health, and convenience. \"The idea came from difficulty finding exactly what I was after: a clean, organic, natural, cotton tampon delivered to me every month. Being an executive in my own company, ordering online is second nature and it was frustrating not being able to find what I was after,\" she explained. This frustration was replicated in the search for a manufacturer, with a bulk of the work of setting up Liverpool St going into sourcing the product. Komander eventually found a partner whose tampons are important from Spain; they are natural cotton, and registered as organic in the European Union. The startup then assembles and packages deliveries locally. Komander originally wanted to look beyond just tampons, however soon decided to start with a focus on one product before expanding. \"Liverpool St plans on expanding into all those monthly needs women have, from organic panty liners to organic cotton face wipes and cotton buds, lip moisturisers, and skincare products...[but] it made sense for our cashflow and to keep the model as simple and useful as possible from the start,\" she explained. \"We also realised that everyone's cycle is different so rather than distributing every week, we decided the 1st of the month would ensure that women had their stock lined up for the month ahead.\" With the service set to launch in the coming weeks, customers will be able to select from three product categories - regular, super, and mixed bundles. As with most other subscription box services, they will be able to buy a one-off, or subscribe for monthly or bi-monthly deliveries. A box costs $8.90, each consisting of two packs of tampons (there are 8 tampons in a regular pack, 7 in a super pack). To get customers on board, Komander said the startup will be targeting women who are \"active on social media, are tech savvy, and health conscious\", with a particular focus on women in regional areas and the time poor. The market is significant: Roy Morgan found in an average of four weeks during 2014, around 3.2 million women aged 14-54 across Australia bought sanitary pads, 2.1 million bought tampons, and 1.6 million bought panty liners, with around one in 10 women in this age group buying all three. Given these numbers, Liverpool St isn't the only subscription box startup playing in this field, with Love Lois one competitor. The service, which offers an organic option, delivers subscribers either pads or tampons, along with some chocolate and a few other goodies. \"While there is an organic tampon company in existence in Australia, there is lots of room for growth in this sector and Liverpool St offers an alternative solution for the consumer, conveniently delivered to their door,\" Komander said. \"The feminine hygiene market hasn't been shaken up in a long time and it's time someone did, and at Liverpool St that is our aim.\" ",

      "content": "No matter where someone went to high school, they can probably recall the traumatic annoyance of being haggled to study for their final year twelve exams. In retrospect, the entire experience doesn't seem like a big deal, but to a high school student, it likely marks the biggest ordeal they've had to undergo since learning to wake up at 7am every morning. To help guide students through the process, the education market has seen a massive influx of tutoring startups and small businesses offering teacher-led services, although what's often missing here is the fresh and knowledgeable touch of a recently graduated student. This was a gap which Connect Education cofounders Lex Ituarte, Edward Cliff, and Sam Kothari saw upon graduating from high school over six years ago, and it was this that pushed the trio to start their own business hiring only recently graduated and high-scoring students as tutors. Now, the startup is taking its graduate-led resources online, offering current students an online platform that allows them to revise for their assessments by completing practice work. Students are able to receive hints and tips from graduates as they work through a question, or even access a video solution if they're really stuck, before being presented with the guided solution using a graduate's thought process upon completion. Although the cofounders left high school with the pursuit of their selected university courses in mind rather than starting a business, the trio worked on developing Connect Education as a side project, feeling that the knowledge and experiences they gained from completing the final exam process could be put to use. \"We started the first year out of high school and what we saw is that students had a lot of value that was sort of locked up in private students, and we wanted to unleash that value on a bigger scale,\" explained Ituarte. \"Back in that time there definitely was very little student-led resources, and we were a bit frustrated by that, as myself and my cofounders figured that we'd done so much preparation for our exams and figuring out what our mistakes were, and we wanted to pass that learning onto other students.\" Beginning offline, the startup began by offering lectures led by high-ranking graduates, which would involve them visiting a school either during or after learning hours to deliver a condensed and insightful lesson. Discussing what these lectures offers students over a professional teacher-led class, Ituarte said it comes down to \"relatability\", plus the intricate knowledge and thought-processes gained from simply being a teenage student. \"There are things that teachers will only know because of their experience teaching, and things that students will only know from their experience learning. We want to transfer that unique knowledge to current teachers. We're not trying to replace teachers, but layer on top of the great work they already do,\" said Ituarte. The startup also began offering weekly private classes held on weekends, and developed its own exclusive textbooks that are bundled in with lectures and classes. Ituarte explained that the textbooks are a \"condensed\" version of a traditional school textbook, which differentiates by including insights from top graduates about how they prepared for their exams or approached a question. Classes and lectures are currently held in Melbourne, across 20 subjects including biology, chemistry, mathematics, and English, with Ituarte saying the startup will look to expand to other states once they've nailed down the curriculum. As for the graduate-led staff, the entrepreneur said the business predominantly targets students with a final total score of 98 and above to ensure a high calibre of education. \"Finding some graduates is organic, and some of it involves reaching out to the top scoring students. [But] now we've kind of built a virtual cycle, where students in high school use our service, get a good score, then are inspired to come back and teach for us,\" he added. Putting this model online meant translating the classes and lectures to digital lessons. According to Ituarte, understanding first how students learn offline was essential to informing how to solve problems for them online. \"It's been an interesting process involving a lot of learning,\" he said. To sign up to the educational platform, a teacher must first create a \"class\" for a student to plug in to, giving the teacher the ability to view their student's progress through an online dashboard. \"[This] allows teachers to see which students are putting the work in, which ones aren't, and which may be struggling with the content so they know who to assist there,\" Ituarte explained. Once a student has completed a question, they'll receive either a \"successful\" or \"unsuccessful\" score, with the teacher then able to help them through with further resources. With the online platform having only recently launched, the startup is currently only working with one subject, as others are set to be released in future. \"We're working with chemistry for now, and we're using that with some of our partner schools and offline audience to figure out what the problems are and build solutions around it,\" said Ituarte. To continue developing the online offerings and expand the offline services into other states, Ituarte said the business will look into funding opportunities to help fuel growth. \"It's a really hard slog when you're bootstrapped, so we're looking into funding opportunities now. We'll continue to evolve the online platform and get more students on board,\" he said. ",

      "content": "Australia's work in fintech is steadily gaining global recognition, with Sydney ranking eighth out of 44 global fintech hubs in a new report released by Deloitte this week, climbing one place from last year's ninth. With 20 'New Hubs' including Auckland, Tokyo, and Bangkok added to this latest ranking, the Connecting Global FinTech: Interim Hub Review 2017 scored the hubs according to factors including government support, innovation culture, proximity to expertise, and regulation, as self-assessed by 'hub representatives'. The rankings have also taken into account an Index Performance Score (IPS) based on data from the Global Financial Centre Index 2016, Doing Business 2017 report, and the Global Innovation Index 2016.  With a lower IPS correlating to better performance, Sydney achieved a score of 44, down from 49 in last year's report. Singapore and London were the top performing hubs, both with an IPS of 11, while New York came in with 14 and Silicon Valley with a score of 18.  Alex Scandurra, CEO of Stone and Chalk and hub representative for Sydney, said it was great to see recognition of Australian fintech coming so far in such a short period of time.  \"Sydney is already an established fintech world power and with the right policy settings and support, has the potential to take advantage of the world's economic gravity moving towards Asia and increasing its fintech exports into the Asian region,\" he said.  The report found Sydney fintechs are performing particularly well in the investment management, risk management, wealth management, lending and deposits, and payments niches, with the regulatory sandbox also highlighted as a plus. The challenges facing the ecosystem, meanwhile, are familiar, from high cost of living to low access to capital, the small size of the market, and the tech skills shortage.   However, Sydney's proximity to Asia and its importance to the region is a boost, with the report noting there has been a \"big push\" in engaging with Asia; the government early last year launched an expert advisory group tasked with developing Australia into the leading market for fintech in the Asia Pacific region, while Stone and Chalk in September welcomed three Chinese startups to the coworking space for three months as part of an 'incubation exchange' program.  \"Australia has robust wealth management and superannuation sectors and holds the lion's share of the customer base in its region,\" the report noted. \"It is the gateway ecosystem into Asia, especially South Asia, with many global banking brands setting up their Asian headquarters in Sydney.\" Despite the solid ranking, Scandurra believes Sydney and Australia more broadly would have been placed higher on the list if the hubs were assessed on the \"actual quality\" of each market's fintech ecosystem, taking in factors such as market adoption, startup quality, volume and performance, and the level of direct investment flows and exits.  According to the latest Pulse of Fintech report, released by KPMG in February, Australia saw a total of $626 million in fintech investment across 25 deals in 2016, a significant increase on the $185 million invested across 23 deals in 2015.

      "content": "Sydney-based startup Qwilr announced today that it has raised $1.5 million in funding from German SaaS-focused venture capital firm, Point Nine. The deal marks the firm's first investment into an Australian company. The startup joins a portfolio boasting a number of big startup names, including Unbounce, Zendesk, and Typeform. The raise brings the total funding for the startup to a modest $2.1 million since launch, with Qwilr having raised $500,000 in 2016 and $100,000 upon its launch. The startup is a platform that is transforming the way people interact with and create documents. It does this by completely reimagining what documents are, relative to the time we now live in - a digital world. Qwilr makes it easy for users to turn documents that would otherwise look static into web pages that are data rich and interactive. As the Qwilr team describes it, the platform looks something like what you would get if website building application Squarespace and media platform Medium had a baby. The platform also allows users to further bring their documents to life via actions like embedding videos or creating interactive charts and customer surveys, through to performing more specific workflows like sales processes - including accepting proposals, e-signing, and payments. Still key to the platform is the idea of creating \"smart documents\" via its data tracking and analytics, with Qwilr helping monitor engagement with content by tracking each view and link click to ensure businesses know where they're going right - or wrong - with proposals and presentations. The funding will go towards new hires to help further expand the platform's capabilities and its reach. \"We are looking for talent ready for a career challenge in a fast paced, collaborative team. Our company is tackling fascinating, complex problems in design to stay ahead of the curve and we are on the hunt for technically-minded, out-of-the-box thinkers to join us,\" said Qwilr cofounder Mark Tanner. The platform is now used by over 40,000 businesses across over 80 countries, and in fact, I have heard many positive things about the organisations cashflow and growth - the company is somewhat of a standout investment for the likes of Sydney Seed Fund and Machdoch Ventures. Attracting Point Nine is a testament to what the Qwilr team has achieved in such a short time; as part of the investment, the firm's cofounder and managing partner, Christoph Janz is set to join Qwilr's board. \"Over the last 20 years or so, Word, Powerpoint and PDF documents became the new standard,\" said Janz. \"I'm pretty sure that in the next 10 years there will be another paradigm shift. We're confident that Qwilr can play a key role in building the document of the future and we're thrilled to be partners on that journey\". The company will use the $1.5 million from Point Nine to make a series of strategic hires across its design, engineering and marketing teams, to further its international growth and solidify its position as a major player in web document design.

Twitter's first employee in Asia, the Californian Knox has worked across Singapore and Australia. She previously held senior positions at companies including Google, Visa International, and Boston Consulting Group, and serves on the boards of Scentre Group and SingaporePost.  Unlockd cofounder and chief Matt Berriman said Knox's experience and networks will be an \"enormous asset\" as the company looks to hit its growth targets; it aims to give $500 million back in value by 2025. \"Aliza has an amazing track record of business growth and accomplishments regionally and globally. The team and I are excited about her joining as we expand our business into other verticals like content streaming and geographies including Asia,\" he said. Knox added that with Unlockd's growth pipeline in emerging markets such as Asia Pacific, she is confident her skillset will add value to the business.  \"I have always been drawn to businesses with a strong entrepreneurial spirit that are creating value for consumers in unique ways. What is especially appealing about Unlockd is its revolutionary business model where each party in the ecosystem wins, combined with visionary leadership and a strong sense of purpose,\" she said. Unlockd last April raised $15 million in Series A funding, with Berriman stating in October that the startup would be looking to raise $30 million more as it pushes for further expansion. The startup's technology offers customers of partner telcos the ability to earn extra data or calling credit in exchange for viewing targeted ads on their lockscreens; it has deals in place with a number of international telecommunications companies, including Boost Mobile in the US and Tesco Mobile in the UK, and is soon set to launch partnerships in the UAE and India. Unlockd also announced a new offering last month through a partnership with MTV Trax in the UK, giving users free access to the premium version of the music streaming app in exchange for the viewing of relevant ads and offers. The new partnership comes as competition for its core service emerges, with New Zealand startup Postr also offering customers of partner telcos extra credit or data in exchange for viewing ads. The startup has two partnerships underway, with Skinny Mobile in New Zealand and Optus in Australia. The market, of course, is huge: global mobile ad spend is expected to grow to US$215 billion by 2021. Mobile advertising grew 48 percent to reach US$80 billion last year, and is expected to account for 52 percent of total digital ad spend by the end of 2017. ",

      "content": "After a rocky start last year, when it was criticised for its launch announcement being accompanied by a picture of a male-heavy team, startup community group TechSydney has today announced a partnership with the Elevacao Foundation aimed at boosting women in startups. The organisation has also begun compiling resources around diversity and inclusion, highlighting best practice and programs to help community members with their own efforts to improve. Dean McEvoy, CEO of TechSydney, said the organisation hopes to help startups and VCs create inclusive businesses and in turn make Sydney a welcoming place to work in tech. \"If we want to make Sydney the most desirable place to run a high growth tech company, we need to make it a great place for talent regardless of gender, race or socioeconomic background,\" he said. By giving people easy access to resources, McEvoy said TechSydney wants to remove the excuses often made for inaction; here, he copped to the \"mistakes\" the organisation itself has made. \"Our founding group was evenly balanced between male and female entrepreneurs but we put out a media release with a photo that showed only one woman,\" he said. \"We have done a lot of learning since then and we think the tech community would benefit from hearing how it can change from people that have been there.\" There was also concern over the organisation's exclusive invitation-only launch dinner, given its core aim is to facilitate collaboration within the startup community. The partnership with the Elevacao Foundation will see the TechSydney team join Elevacao's network of founders, investors, and corporates to assist women in starting and growing tech companies. Launched in mid-2015 to help women in and get into tech, Elevacao is active in New York City, Melbourne, and Sydney, running a range of pitch workshops and events, while its 'Tech Ready' workshop aims to help women tech founders without a tech background understand the fundamentals. Aubrey Blanche, head of diversity and inclusion at Atlassian, which has been vocal about its efforts to boost diversity internally, said the resources compiled by TechSydney will help current founders build inclusivity into their cultures from the beginning. \"Sydney's diverse population has always been its strength, and it's a hugely important part of the future tech workforce,\" she said. \"Making early investments to ensure we create diverse and inclusive environments will be key to driving Australian innovation, and to making Sydney as a global tech leader.\" The push to build inclusivity into a company's culture from day dot comes as more examples continue to arise of how bad it can get for women and minorities in tech. Looking at startups around Australia, the latest Startup Muster report found that 23.5 percent of founders surveyed were women, up from 17.4 percent in 2015. However, the number of women employed by startups is low, with 47.5 percent of startups not employing any women at all (though of course, many early stage startups are run by solo founders). Looking at the corporate sphere, also launching an initiative to help build an inclusive culture this week was National Australia Bank (NAB), which yesterday appointed Girl Geek Academy cofounder and CEO Sarah Moran as its first 'girl geek in residence'. Moran will work with NAB's technology team through December to implement Girl Geek Academy's main programs, such as its SheHacks and SheMakes hackathons, within the bank, the aim to get more women into senior tech roles. Dayle Stevens, founder of NAB's Connecting Women in Technology program and divisional CIO of technology support services Dayle Stevens, explained Moran is bringing an outsider's perspective that will help ensure the bank's Women in Technology program has maximum impact. \"Sarah and the Girl Geek Academy pitched the Girl Geek in Residence idea as an opportunity to come together, use our knowledge and our networks to tackle the issues facing women in technology together,\" she said. \"As a major employer in the technology industry, this partnership is helping us deliver on our commitment to supporting gender diversity and the push to see more women in technology.

      "content": "South Australian space startup Fleet has raised $5 million in a Series A round led by Blackbird Ventures, with participation from Earth Space Robotics, Silicon Valley firm Horizon Partners, and Atlassian's Mike Cannon-Brookes. Founded in Adelaide in 2015 by Flavia Tata Nardini, Matt Pearson, and Dr Matthew Tetlow, the startup is working to launch a network of more than 100 nanosatellites to create a global network enabling low-bandwidth connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices; its aim is to connect the 75 billion devices expected to be online by 2025 for free. Italian Tata Nardini, a space engineer with the European Space Agency and Dutch research institute TNO, said though there is a lot of chatter about the potential of connected devices, little action is being taken to make things reality. \"We're designing a technology infrastructure that will underpin the new industrial revolution. It will connect all corners of the globe to create a digital nervous system of devices,\" she said. Tata Nardini explained the startup chose to launch in Australia as the country is home to \"many of the industries that need this type of technology the most\". \"Farmers, environmentalists, mining and oil engineers, and logistics professionals will all greatly benefit from the data and opportunities a switched-on planet produces,\" she explained. \"Our goal is for industries to use this technology to make real, tangible efficiency improvements to the ways they operate and address issues; be it measuring the effect of climate change on outer corners the Great Barrier Reef, or tracking important cargo like aid as it journeys across the Indian Ocean.\" The fresh funding will help bring this vision to life, going towards building the startup's first nanosatellites and exploring of global opportunities as understanding of the technology's potential grows: Fleet is working in a similar space to international companies including Kepler Communications, Astrocast, and Sky and Space Global, an ASX-listed Israeli startup. Cannon-Brookes called the startup a \"prime example of Australian-led innovation at its best\". \"They're rare, but every so often an idea cross your path that really gets the adrenaline pumping. Fleet answers one of modern society's most difficult but important questions: how do we bring all the devices and technology we've created together to work as one?\" Blackbird cofounder Niki Scevak, who will be joining the Fleet board as part of the firm's investment, added, \"We invest in Aussie startups with big ideas who want to be the best in the world. The team at Fleet have the credentials and strategy to make their dream a reality. Space was traditionally the province of governments but now startups can solve our largest problems through satellites and rockets because it's so cheap and accessible.\" Fleet is just one of a growing number of Australian space startups, which have flourished largely without government support; while a recent report found every industry segment in Australia uses space-derived services and data in some form across their business activities, Australia does not have a national space agency. A white paper released in March by the Space Industry Association of Australia (SIAA) estimated that, with its 0.8 percent share of the global space economy, the Australian space sector currently produces annual revenues of between $3-4 billion, employing between 9,500 to 11,500 people. The SIAA believes the establishing of an Australian Space Agency by the government to lead a \"cohesive national space strategy\" could see these figures double within five years, with the Agency's long-term aim to capture 4 percent of the world market within 20 years. Tata Nardini believes Australia is missing out by leaving space out of the conversation around innovation. \"Australia is one of the largest economies in the world to not have its own space agency. Projects like this are crucial to our future as they test our creativity and ability to think big. If we're not always asking what's next, we'll never really have a place in the innovation game.\" Fleet plans to launch the first of its nanosatellites next year. ",

      "content": "Country towns are stereotypically known for their close communities and friendliness, with neighbours always ready to give each other a helping hand. Launched late last year, The Rural Network is a platform looking to translate that community spirit online by bringing the task economy to the bush, starting with over 60 regional and rural communities across South Australia. The platform allows those in need of a hand, whether it be creating a website or fixing a fence on a farm, to post a task that someone in the community can do. A taskmaster who signed up in the site's earliest days was Ben, who first came across an ad for the site on Gumtree. \"It was a short little ad, just asking if anyone was interested in helping out rural communities with any odd jobs, and that sounded like something I'd be into,\" he explained. With the platform then in the very early startup stage, Ben answered the ad and started talking to cofounder Bryce Eldredge, who talked him through the process. \"At first I thought it might be a bit shifty, with the ad being on Gumtree, but once I got speaking to Bryce and we got discussing what it was all about, it just sounded like a good way to connect with other people who need your help,\" Ben explained. \"There's obviously repeat business; if people need you to mow their lawns or clean their gutters, those are things that need to be done on an ongoing basis, so I thought, eventually it's something you can keep on doing. Plus it's a good way to meet new people and improve on your own skills.\" Living in a town both on the edge of metropolitan Adelaide and on the doorstep of farming country, Ben said tasks are almost evenly split between people on farms needing an extra set of hands with tasks like cutting hay bales or repairing fences, and elderly people in small towns that need help with odd jobs around the house. \"The majority of people I've helped have been elderly, doing a couple of painting jobs and some general gardening and landscaping. They're always so lovely,\" he said. In fact, that's where the idea for The Rural Network first came from; when Bryce Eldredge's grandfather died, Bryce wanted to make sure his grandmother had some help to maintain her property. Serving away in the Defence Force at the time, Bryce asked his friends and colleagues at home to help out but, not wanting to overdo it, he eventually decided to source casual labour, and the idea for The Rural Network was soon born. With Ben working two other jobs, he picks up a task from The Rural Network when he has spare time; with a dozen or so jobs posted in his area each week, there is enough to keep taskmasters busy. \"A lot of them are bigger jobs, because a lot of the people on big farms have some big tasks to do, so you need the extra time to do them,\" Ben explained. As well as the extra cash, completing tasks through The Rural Network has allowed Ben to see more of the country and meet the kinds of people he wouldn't have been able to if he hadn't signed up. \"I met a lovely mother and daughter farming team who were really lovely; they took me back to their property because the roads were so rough I couldn't even get my car in, and they were telling me all their stories and what they get up to on the farm,\" Ben said. \"They had sensational view from their homestead...there are these spots that you can just never get to unless you know the person, so this is a unique way to get a little taste of what rural life really is, by helping people out. I didn't think it was going to be as beautiful as it was.\" Despite the fact it's an online platform, Ben believes The Rural Network has grown in large part thanks to word of mouth - one of the most important tools in a business's arsenal in country towns and communities. The idea of community was also what convinced Ben to give the platform a go despite never having worked for a complete stranger he had met through the internet before. \"I wasn't overly apprehensive...I'm not really the kind of guy who worries, even though when I signed up it was back before the website was really properly well done,\" he laughed. \"I think I typed 'The Rural Network' into Google and it wouldn't even come up with the website. It's great now, it's come a long way in just a few months.\" As The Rural Network looks to grow its community beyond South Australia, it's important for taskmasters working through the platform to be aware of their tax obligations. Freelancers, sole traders, and taskmasters working through task economy platforms such as The Rural Network or Airtasker are self-employed and generally require an Australian Business Number (ABN). If they are earning over $75,000 annually from these activities, a taskmaster also needs to be registered for and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is reported and paid through the lodging of regular Business Activity Statements (BAS). Designed with the task economy in mind, Airtax is an online tax tool for taskmasters, sole traders, and freelancers. Through Airtax you can register for an ABN and GST for free, complete your BAS and submit your income tax return in minutes. All submissions are lodged by a PwC tax agent and with notifications, the app helps those working in the task economy by offering an easy and accessible way to remain tax compliant. Airtax will also help users through the claiming of deductions for expenses incurred in the course of their work, outlining common claimable expenses to reduce the GST owed. For a taskmaster such as Ben, possible deductions could include vehicle usage and the cost of tools required to carry out tasks. As The Rural Network grows to help more communities, Ben said he's keen to get to know more people and hear their stories. \"There's a lot of interesting people out there.\" Is The Rural Network Australia's Favourite Task Platform?

      "content": "South Australian online art startup Bluethumb has raised $1 million in a Series A round led by QUT Creative Enterprise Australia (CEA) and Grand Prix Capital, which will go towards expanding out the business's Indigenous Art Centre outreach program and developing new features for the platform. Beginning its journey in 2009, Bluethumb is a platform which allows artists around Australia to showcase and sell their work online; it launched a program aimed at onboarding Indigenous art onto the platform following a $500,000 raise in 2015. As Bluethumb cofounder Edward Hartley explained, the program works through Bluethumb sending out expert art curators connected to the Indigenous art space out to remote communities to speak to the local artists and art centre employees about how to sell their work online. \"It sort of evolved over time,\" said Hartley. \"We started looking at our art on Bluethumb and realised we were sort of light on Indigenous art, so we started conducting research and realised that although Indigenous artists are often in remote locations, the way the industry has evolved, with art centres supporting large numbers, it was potentially something we could actually access and help.\" Help, according to Hartley, would put Indigenous artists on the map through the distribution opportunities available via Bluethumb, while on the flip side providing collectors with \"unique and iconic\" Australian artwork. \"It's also a brilliant export opportunity going down the track,\" he added. The startup trialled the concept with a few Indigenous art centres and, seeing success, and moved to create an exclusive digital space on the platform to feature digital art from centres. Hartley said the funding will help forward Bluethumb's \"on the ground\" approach to educating Indigenous art centres about how to get their communities artwork online. \"It's all about getting on the ground and helping them with the initial signup, and showing them really how easy it is to use,\" he said. \"I guess coming up in person and being on the ground gives a more personalised service and really gives them a chance to flourish.\" Speaking about the program, Lauren Hicks, Arts and Culture Officer at Injalak Arts, a centre utilising Bluethumb, said it serves as a way to solve the disconnect between remote artists and buyers. The art gallery, which is located within Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, is often blocked off from buyers and tourisms during the wet season, rendering in-person sales near impossible. \"Being so remote, it is often difficult for art tourists and collectors to come out and see the artwork in person. We have some amazing indigenous artists working with us and it is great that we can help get their art out there and appreciated by more people in the off season,\" she said. Part of the funding will also go towards building out the platform, which Hartley said will come in the form of finalising a new feature that allows galleries to upload their featured artists work online for sale. Also in the pipeline for Bluethumb is developing advice AI and machine learning to help guide buyers towards artwork they're interested in. \"If you think about Bluethumb and what we have...putting the right artwork in front of people and helping them explore their own interest is critical. It's not like retail sites where you have twenty products and you pick from one of 20. [But] those advancements take a lot of investments from the development side,\" said Hartley. ",

      "content": "Though the world of accounting software is more sophisticated than it has ever been before, for various types of organisations there are still some key features missing. That's what Adam Clark found while working at Xero and chatting to charities using the software: it worked great for many things, but it didn't help speed up the process of creating annual receipts for donors. So he started to build Donation Manager. At its most basic level, Clark explained, it allows a charity to quickly generate donation receipts for donors, a process which most small to medium charities are still doing manually. \"If you consider there are over 15,000 active charities in New Zealand, and each was to save even just one hour a year - which I hope would be a minimum saving - that's 15,000 hours volunteers can spend on solving the problem their charity has been set up to solve,\" Clark said. Clark, who had been involved with various charities since he finished studying, took a job at Xero in 2011, where he said the company \"kind of let me loose\" in the sales and customer experience areas. Here, he was able to talk with hundreds of charity treasurers and administrators about the problems they faced. A number of key issues kept coming up in these conversations: that there was no charity-specific software available at a reasonable cost to help decrease their administrative burden, with the time taken to make and send out annual receipts a frequent example; that charities have problems with both engaging existing donors and attracting new ones, which flows onto declining revenues from private sources. Clark began looking at how to start building the platform in 2013, at which point he said there was nothing in the market that came close to helping charities with their needs. \"There are some more options out there now, but they are still relatively expensive, or lacking in functionality,\" he said. Despite his links to the tech community, the journey from initial idea to launch wasn't exactly an easy one, with Clark saying he almost gave up a few times. \"The initial concepts were developed based on conversations with all the charities, and then refined based on my light BA work with Xero developers on functionality directed at accountants (which is now morphing into Xero HQ). Clark incorporated the company in 2013, and put the development out for tender on Freelancer, awarding the contract to an overseas development firm that had solid positive feedback. \"However, milestones dragged out and a six month build turned into a half built product in 18 months. When they were due to provide me with source code of their latest updates to receive their next tranche of funding, they disappeared off the face of the earth with me a few grand out of pocket; not brilliant as my wife was studying and I was on a single income,\" Clark said. It took him a while to recover, Clark said, and in mid-2015 he had some spec work done by a local development firm which put the cost of local development far out of the reach of his ability to self-fund. He shopped around local social enterprise investors to see if there was any interest in funding a build, but had no luck. At the end of that year he posted another job on Freelancer to have someone build a \"very, very basic\" version of the software based on a WordPress back end. When this was done, he went out to charities to let them know it was there, and got a number on board. With this, Clark said he judged the venture as a \"limited success\", deciding that if it was going to work, the software had to be operated by a charity itself so that any profits could go back to charities, with the hope that some others might \"pick up the tab\" once they saw the impact it was having. \"Running it through a charitable trust allows me to take advantage of enough free software offers from corporates to keep current level overheads extremely low, and manageable from a personal perspective,\" he added. From there, Clark reached out to a New Zealand tech Facebook group to explain the concept and ask what a reasonable rate for a local build would be. Here someone offered to come on board and build the front-end in his spare time, if Clark could get someone to build just the back end - so he sold the last of his Xero shares, borrowed some money, and brought on development agency Enspiral Craftworks. But that wasn't the end of the story - the front-end developer ended up having to leave the project due to medical issues. Luckily, the developer at Enspiral Craftworks could take over the whole project, so Clark extended his mortgage and got her to finish the job herself. For a charity, getting started means signing up and inputting all the relevant details about the organisation, and then figuring out what they want their annual receipt or letter to look like.  They can add contacts manually or import a CSV file, then create donation transactions to match the contacts, again manually or by importing from CSV or Xero.  \"The process is a lot more straight forward if they use Xero, as naturally I have leaned the product towards working best when there is an integration,\" Clark said. \"Once they have all their donation transactions for the year added in and matched to contacts, they click a couple of buttons, and their annual receipts are ready to download in PDF format. The charity user can then either post or email the receipts to their donors like they normally would. We definitely want to streamline that final part of the process in the future.\" Clark is looking to extend the platform in the future by creating a donor portal, allowing donors themselves to get easy access to their end of year receipts in a single place.   \"There is a lot of friction in the donation process, and one of the areas identified by [the Inland Revenue Department] and [Department of Internal Affairs] is the administrative burden in claiming the donation tax credits,\" Clark said. \"If a person could login at the end of the year and access all of their donation receipts from a single place, it would make claiming the tax rebate so much easier. And I'm hoping if it's easy to claim the rebate, it will increase people's confidence in donating more to charities.\" With so many years spent building the platform, Clark said he now has a number of charities waiting to use it, while he will also look to go deeper into the market by tapping into the contacts he made while at Xero.  The platform is free for charities in New Zealand to use, with Clark to explore putting in place a fee for charities overseas. There are two main competitors Clark sees in the space, Infoodle and Vega, who he wishes \"all the best to as they are trying to help the sector as well\", but believes that Donation Manager's features and the fact it's free put it above the rest. Looking ahead, Clark aims to bring on funding to further develop the platform. As well as the donor portal, in the pipeline is the integration of a CRM system to help charities better communicate with donors. ",

      "content": "There's no shame in admitting that many of us need a little (or a lot of) motivation from someone to get us up off the couch and active. In fact, having professional guidance is useful in the context of pretty much any health goal, even if it involves some 'qualified dietician' pushing against me devouring chips for dinner for the ninth day in the row. Getting the everyday Australian motivated to work towards their health goals was a central thought Sydney-sider David Parrelli had when he imagined HealthCoach, a fitness app that connects users to virtual health coaches.  \"A lot of people want to achieve fitness or health-based goals but don't really know how to get there,\" he said. \"They'll then tend to use online websites or guides to try and do it on their own, but end ou giving up after a few weeks. We feel that if you're held accountable and have someone to push you, you're much more likely to move towards your goals.\" Through the app, users are able to be matched with health professionals such as dieticians, personal trainers and nutritionists based on their selected health goals. Once connected, and for a fee, the user is able to \"subscribe\" to the health professional after a seven day trial period, where they're able to seek professional advice over instant-messaging. \"[The trial period] will reduce the barrier to entry and ensure that each coach is the right fit for the client. We feel it's a better way to convert customers from a free to paid system,\" Parrelli explained. Elaborating on the client-to-coach relationship, Parrelli described it as an \"online consultation\", and one that is continued throughout the monthly subscription period while the client works towards their health goals.  Planned for release into public beta in the near future, Parrelli said the app will eventually see each coach providing their clients with a personalised health brief which pieces out how the client will achieve their goals, as well as ongoing advice and motivation based on the client's progress.  Parrelli explained that HealthCoach actually emerged out of another project the entrepreneur was working on in the fitness space, which looked to become the dating or connection app for fitness. \"It was basically an app that connects fitness enthusiasts to a workout buddy, but I spoke to someone in the health profession space and he said to me, I wish there was a product out there to help me find clients on the side of my normal work and get paid for what I do,\" said Parrelli.  \"I figured there were other solutions out there that do the same thing in different industries, so I did some market research to coaches to see if it was something they'd actually want to use.\" Finding a trend of health professionals and consumers interested in an online consultation solution, Parrelli pivoted his work on the connection app towards forming HealthCoach. Although some of the frameworks were in place for the new app, pivoting wouldn't be simple, as Parrelli discussed how he continues to balance development on the app with his \"regular\" freelance work. \"Because I'm bootstrapping the project, [income] is something I have to be mindful of. It does get tough a lot of the time, but it really just comes down to time-management and finding a balance,\" he said. As to HealthCoach's target clientele, Parrelli explained that the app will branch out to users with differing sizes and types of health goals, whether that be trimming off a few kilos or undertaking a revolutionary diet change. Meanwhile, in terms of coaches, the founder explained that the startup is looking to target health professionals searching for a \"side-gig\" to match their day-to-day consultation practices.  \"Our scope will initially focus on dieticians, personal trainers, exercise physiologists, and nutritionists, then we'll look to onboard other practitioners. We'll be doing a full background check on each new health coach who applies and also monitor coaches to make sure they're performing their tasks and helping the client,\" said Parrelli. Applications can be submitted through the HealthCoach website, with the founder saying the startup has already onboarded a number of practitioners to work with clients during the initial MVP. Based on their subscription numbers, coaches will be paid fortnightly through the app. While the startup is currently focused on online consultations, Parrelli said he's also looking towards adding an offline service, where users would be able to organise physical meetups with coaches through the platform. With a focus on personal fitness trainers, another startup working with the space of connecting users to health practitioners for face-to-face sessions is Pummel. Users on the app are able to select a fitness area they want to train, before being presented with a health coach in their local area.  Parrelli said he imagines HealthCoach also using geolocation features to connect clients to coaches for offline services, although for the time being the business will focus on developing its online based features. \"We want a user to be able to track their exercise on the app, such as the kilometres and time they ran, and have that data passed onto the coach. It's about facilitating that relationship and having that data sent through the app first,\" said Parrelli. \"I'd love the end product to be both an offline and online experience, so you're always connected with your coach.\"\n\nOther features in the pipeline including the ability for clients to organise private calls with their coach, with the startup to begin looking towards funding opportunities in order to fuel development.

      "content": "Following the raising of a $5.3 million Series A round last September, social influencer startup Tribe has this week announced its launch into UK market, having secured a lineup of initial British clients. Three major brands have joined up, including department store Selfridges - which partnered with fellow Australian startup Mon Purse last year - alcohol brand Moet Hennessy, and personal health company Burt's Bees. The brands have purchased over 100 pieces of content from content creators in the UK. Moet Hennessey's UK Digital Marketing Manager, Greg McCann, said after hearing the success the brand's Australian base has had with Tribe, they were quick to set up their own local campaign. \"The results have been great, having received 99 submissions from talented content creators in just over a week,\" he said. Launched by television personality Jules Lund in late 2015, Tribe helps connect brands to \"micro-influencers\" or personalities on social media platforms such as Instagram, and pay them for bespoke marketing campaigns. Tribe's CEO, Anthony Svirskis, said at the time of the raise that business had grown rapidly in the Australia despite only a short time in market, and felt ready to begin expanding overseas. \"We reached a point pretty quickly since launch, and we're not yet 12 months in the market, where we felt that our trajectory and the core numbers on the platform in the local market, were really strong, and understanding the space we're in moves very quickly, we wanted to take what we have in Australia and go into new markets,\" he said. Since launch, the startup stated it has connected over 2000 brands with 10,000 different influences, who have generated roughly 75,000 pieces of branded content across social media platforms. Speaking about the UK launch, Lund said the app's time-saving potential and ability to harness a digital form of \"word of mouth\" marketing has been key to its success. \"Word of mouth recommendations have always been the holy grail of marketing, and technology enables us to democratise the influencer marketplace. With the Tribe app, brands can now manage 100 micro influencers in the time it took to manually manage one,\" he said. The startup's success comes as it works through a crowded space. Also looking to harness the power of 'word of mouth' marketing, last year saw social media influencer startups HooZu and HypeTap enter the market. Helmed by former Wallaby Lote Tuqiri, HooZu focuses on scouting out influencers for brands to market their product through. Meanwhile, Melbourne competitor HypeTap allows brands to search for influences and create briefs for them to work from. Another competitor is Visual Amplifiers (VAMP), which last year brought on Todd Sampson as a non-executive director. Having opened offices in Singapore and Hong Kong earlier this year, VAMP is now seeking out an IPO. ",

      "content": "In the 15 years since Moneyball was published, much of the team sports world has changed the way it looks at and talks about athletes and their performance. Advanced stats now influence the way players are signed and teams fielded, with the numbers also making their way into television broadcasts and newspaper game reports. For fans of Australia's National Rugby League (NRL), however, it can seem that the league is still for the most part stuck on selection by gut feeling (or whoever the coach isn't feuding with this week). Aiming to bring advanced analytics to the fore in the NRL is LeverEdge Sports, founded by Prad Navaratnam and Sen Thevarajah, which is looking to help teams make sense of the mountains of performance data they collect. \"In rugby league, we do this by taking the raw data that teams receive on their players' performance and analysing into a second tier level of data which in turn helps calculate an Impakt Score. The Impakt Score is calculated using a specifically-created algorithm which is built according to each playing position,\" Navaratnam explained. \"This helps teams and coaches put a 'magic number' on every player's performance and brings everyone to an even playing field. It takes all the media noise out of player performances and judges players across every critical metric based on their playing position.\" Like many a project these days focused around data analytics in sports, LeverEdge too was inspired by Moneyball, with Navaratnam and Thevarajah wondering if they could apply a similar methodology to other sports to see how true all the noise around player performances is. \"Our background is in banking and investments, and we used our experience to then start modelling algorithms based on the investment world, except in the world of rugby league,\" Navaratnam said. \"When we started to test these algorithms out over a season of NRL, it started to spit out some interesting results that showed players that were not getting noticed by the media but were performing a lot better than those that were getting noticed.\" Not being from a professional rugby league background, however, came with its own challenges, however Navaratnam believes the results being delivered by the product began opening doors. The Impakt Score system work helps analyse and score players across four different rugby league competitions - the NRL, Holden Cup, NSW Cup, and Queensland Cup - with players given a number rating, as well as in-depth analysis highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. \"The system is best used on a comparative basis, where players and coaches are able to compare any individual player to some of the best in the comp in that particular position. This helps identify where each player must improve or maintain,\" Navaratnam said. Navaratnam further explained that each algorithm is customisable, allowing teams to adjust how they want to measure their players. \"This has helped build that trust with our clients and they feel comfortable that they are able to measure the players how they would like, yet at the same time leverage off our intellectual property and technology to help them get to where they want faster and more smarter,\" he said. \"Every coach and every team does things differently, so it was important that we remained flexible enough to meet our clubs' requirements but also not too flexible that we simply became a software company building a platform for every club.\" The pitch to get clients on board is \"fairly simple\", Navaratnam said, focusing on how the startup's aim to help clubs make better use of the mountains of data they collect by making sense of it for them. A similar point was brought up by William Strange, founder of Melbourne sportstech startup Sports Performance Tracking, which pairs a wearable device with an analytics platform to help athletes and clubs make sense of their performances. Though he had first targeted the amateur market, Strange found a space with the pros as, he said, a lot of clubs don't actually have the expertise in sports science or analytics required to understand all the data being generated. \"One of the biggest problems with the modern day technology is that it creates so much data that no one knows how to understand it, and it's almost more important to understand the data, or five percent of the data, than to have 100 percent and not understand any of it,\" he said. Looking at the sportstech landscape across Australia and the companies such as Sports Performance Tracking and Catapult Sports doing the wearables and the analytics, Navaratnam believes LeverEdge's closest competitors still come in the form of the teams themselves. \"There are some teams that prefer to do what we do in-house, simply because of the 'trust' factor of us not coming from a rugby league background,\" he explained. Of course, the startup's work can also be applied to other sports, with each sport to be treated as its own \"product universe\". \"Within each universe comes its own requirements and as such requires to break down the sport further to ensure we are able to get it to a stage where we are able to then re-construct our own product using everything that is important,\" Navaratnam said. \"It is pretty important to know the sport inside out. This is where being a sports junkie like us and watching those countless hours of sports is a benefit. Knowing the sport, knowing what makes a successful team and player in that sport and then breaking it down further to knowing how to be successful is the key.\" Once that's done, Navaratnam said, the technology can built around that. Over the coming months, the startup will look to secure seed funding to help further develop its existing offerings, as well as new products, while also looking to new markets. ",

      "content": "The idea of sailing out in the open seas may bring to mind relaxation and plenty of wine on a state-of-the-art cruise liner - unless you don't handle motion well, in which case you might envision a terrible time. For many yacht owners, however, sailing represents a chance for competitiveness and intricate teamwork, where they can pitt their boats against another for a coveted prize. Through yacht clubs and groups, the community of sailing-lovers is a tightknit one, and one that Sydney startup MySail is looking to bring to a centralised online space. Through two online platforms, the business helps racing yacht owners manage their crew, from the point of hiring to all the organisational facets of scheduling. An online connection platform, MySail's \"crew finder\" wants to eliminate the bundle of traditional legwork that goes into sourcing crew members, typically involving whiteboard callouts and paper-list signups in yacht clubs. Meanwhile, the startup's management platform looks to simplify the email and spreadsheeting involved with organising a race event and crew members through a cloud-based management system. MySail founder Deborah Dalziel, part of the sailing community herself, began developing the platforms late last year, after first imagining the solutions nearly a year back. \"I then started looking at market size by doing some research and talking to local yacht clubs around Sydney, to really determine if the problem was big enough to build a solution around. We started developing in November and finished the beta of the crew finder by the end of the month,\" said Dalziel. Bootstrapping most of the development process herself, Dalziel quickly recognised that continuing to fund the startup herself wouldn't be sustainable. While a paid subscription service is planned for MySail's future, the startup is currently offered access to both platforms free of charge and ad revenue. Searching for options, the entrepreneur secured an MVP grant from the government as well as support from BlueChilli. With financial backing, the startup's management platform soft-launched into market last month, while the crew finder has continued to operate in beta within two yacht clubs in Sydney. \"We've been focusing in Sydney for the time being because I'm based there,\" Dalziel said. \"That said, [the platforms] will be available Australia-wide because they're Australia-wide problems. These issues yacht owners face spans internationally too; I've spoken to people from many different areas like Canada, where I'm from, as well as Southeast Asia and the United States.\" With international expansion set as the long-term goal, Dalziel said the startup will first look to merge both its platforms together into one centralised space under the MySail banner, which will enable the integrated solution to offer the complete end-to-end process. \"There's no one that does the end-to-end of finding a new crew then getting it sorted. There are other systems that do bits and pieces, but nothing together,\" she said. \"We'll help crew managers get organised earlier and actually find new crew members really quickly if someone drops out. You'll also be able to view which crew are available so you can sort out who to assign to an event, all on the same platform.\" Currently, a yacht owner looking to find new crew, can search through the connection platform for candidates, narrowing their search by location and soon, according to Dalziel, by search categories too. A crew member's profile will contain all the details a manager looks for in their search, including sailing experience, yacht racing knowledge, location, prefered race length and crew position, yacht size, and availability. Recommendations can also be left underneath a user profiles to bolster their reputation by contacting the MySail team. \"Each profile also displays basic information of age, location, and an image preview when searching, so users don't have to waste too much of their time clicking on someone who doesn't have enough experience,\" Dalziel added. When someone's contacted to join a crew, they'll receive an email. The process is similar to how the management platform operates, where crew leaders are able to \"add\" members to a team and assign them positions for an event by sending them an email invite. Events themselves are scheduled and outlined on the management platform, where a crew manager can also sort through a team member's qualifications and availability to determine who to assign to an event. Since testing the crew finding platform in two of Sydney's yacht clubs, Dalziel said the startup has accumulated roughly 400 users, a number set to grow as the business rolls out its offerings to the wider yacht racing community. \"I have a really big vision about where this can go. There's quite a big market in terms of management and servicing, so we'll look to add new features to support that,\" she said. \"It's quite a tight network of people, so I want to get a lot of people sharing it and get people in through the yacht club's, popular sailing websites and social media. In the next month these two platforms will be combined.\" ",

      "content": "California-based on-demand insurance startup Trov has raised US$45 million ($59.44 million) in a Series D round led by Munich Re / HSB Ventures, with participation from all its Series C investors, including Australia's Suncorp Group. The funding, which brings the total raised by the startup to date to US$85 million ($112.28 million), will be used to launch the platform into new markets and expand the categories of items that it covers. Munich Re will be underwriting Trov's insurance capabilities across Europe, Asia, and South Africa, while new investor Sompo Holdings will help bring Trov to Japan. The Trov app launched last year, enabling consumers to buy insurance for individual items, such as laptops, bikes, instruments and so on, and turn it on or off as they please, creating 'micro-duration' policies. Australia was its first launch market for the app thanks to a friendly regulatory atmosphere and a partnership the startup had established with Suncorp in 2014 to help users keep track of their belongings through its tech. Investing US$5 million into Trov's Series C round last year, Suncorp has also underwritten the startup's insurance risk locally. The app has since had over 35,000 downloads in Australia, according to Trov, with more than $2 million worth of items protected. The startup also stated that 65 percent of Australian customers did not switch off the insurance once they had switched it on. The startup stated in November that the majority of engagement had been from 18-34 year olds, who have most commonly been protecting items such as mobile phones and laptops. Scott Walchek, founder and CEO of Trov, said, \"Trov's early success in Australia and UK is demonstrating that modern consumers want a new way to protect their things. With the additional capital and extensive partnerships, soon millions of people around the world will be empowered to protect the things that enhance their lives whenever and however they want.\" \"The combined capabilities of key global insurance leaders will streamline our regulatory path and increase our go-to-market effectiveness in each new territory we pursue.\" The latest Pulse of Fintech report from KPMG, examining fintech trends and investment over the fourth quarter of 2016, identified insurance technology (insurtech) as a particularly strong trend, with global investment in the sector crossing US$1 billion, up from the US$590 million invested in 2015. The report predicted that most insurtech investments will most likely focus on companies specialising on specific individual components of the insurance process, though \"there may be some that follow the lead of Lemonade and Trov\", which it identified as early-mover, full-service digital insurance providers.

      "content": "If you think about the layout of a worksite, for most what will first come to mind is an image of tradies scattered across the highs and lows of a structure being built. Managing employees over an open area full of potential dangers is difficult, and as such it's one that a number of startups entering the market have looked to solve. One of these solutions is Safesite, an Australia-founded startup aiming to facilitate safety management on worksites through sharing and analytics via an app. Another is Perth-based Cribber, a new player in the space biting down on facilitating communication between tradies and site managers for a small monthly cost. The Cribber platform allows managers to share information with their workers and stakeholders through a content \"bulletin board\". Acting like a private social stream, tradies around a worksite are able to view content, while site managers are able to view who has engaged with it for the purpose of ensuring compliance and employee engagement. Mike Watson, who developed Cribber alongside cofounder Jasmin Ward, explained that the solution was built to fit the on-the-go, deskless lifestyle of tradies, who typically don't access traditional communication or project management tools. \"Everyone on the worksite is on their phone in the crib room and when they're around the site. We knew most of the frontline workforce wasn't going to have a desk and a computer, so the app is the way we access them,\" he said. Watson's insights came directly from within the construction industry, where he spent 10 years working as an engineer on worksites in both Australia and the Middle East. Here, Watson explained he noticed a distinct lack of engagement with the way communication was dished out to site workers on a daily basis. \"In a way it was really patronising, and a lot of the time the workers wouldn't retain the information depending on who was sharing it. So I left my job between September and August last year and we began working on it,\" said Watson. The startup entered Perth's Founder Institute incubator program, which helped push the early stage idea towards commercialisation. Key to progressing through the incubation process, Watson said, was the focus both cofounders had on conducting market research, a process which helped the pair \"validate\" their ideas. \"We went out to conduct 100 customer reviews to really nail down what the problem was that we were solving. That really helped us get some traction. Once we had some traction and a little bit of revenue it was easier to get to the next stage,\" he said. The next stage for the business came in the form of joining the Plus Eight accelerator program, run in conjunction with muru-D, earlier this year, which will provide the startup with $40,000 in seed funding and industry insight once the program rounds up in a few months' time. While developing Cribber, Watson said the startup took into mind potential competitors, which would help define the product's point of difference as a communicative and compliance focused tool. \"We know there are lots of other apps and management systems out there that do inspection forms and reporting and that type of thing. Our assessment is targeting the front line workforce, while those other tools are mainly used for supervisors and managers,\" Watson added. In Cribber's current model, workers interact with content rather than post it themselves, with Watson saying that will be open for change in coming updates. Interaction typically comes in the form of opening a post and reading it, but tradies are also able to e-sign a document confirming they've read it if requested by a manager. Through the app, tradies are able to receive push notifications is a message pops up while they're working, and also share content online with family and friends. For site managers, content is posted and curated through an online web portal. \"They create a moderated feed of information that's supposed to be quite direct and avoid a lot of the noise you find in other communication tools out there. They can also invite other users and create teams to split up users, to customise content to go to different groups,\" said Watson. According to Watson, a typical day will see at least three to four bulletins going out, across things like traffic management plans, daily safety notices, and weather reports. The cofounder added that Cribber is also intended for other side content too, such as work events and bus timetable postings for remote jobs. \"Then on the compliance side, if the admin sends out something that they want to know that all their employees have read and understood, they can send out a request for that,\" he explained. Looking to further empower Cribber's compliance and communicative potential, the startup is also looking into adding other analytical metrics such as engagement time and response speed. \"Eventually we'll add coaching around the bulletins, so analysing what the message is and seeing what words and content can help improve the effectiveness of communication,\" Watson added. Since Cribber's target industries of mining, construction, and oil already contain \"some big players\", according to Watson, the startup will look to focus on setting itself apart and growing a reputable basis through its first client companies. With Canadian and New Zealand businesses already taking interest, Cribber will look to further its local and global reach through the raising of up to $500,000 in seed funding for development. ",

      "content": "There is much to debate about the growth of Australia's startup ecosystem, but it is a truth almost universally (well, in Australia, at least) acknowledged that the local fintech sector is doing well, bolstered by government support and corporate involvement. While most startups look to develop sophisticated products and services to tackle problems across every niche imaginable in the sector for savvy local consumers and companies, Perth fintech Peppermint Innovation thought there were significant opportunities to be found with those entirely new to banking. Founded by brothers Chris and Anthony Kain, who grew up in the small town of Narrogin, the company is providing mobile remittance services to the unbanked - those without a bank account - in the Philippines. Statistics show that around 70 percent of the almost 100 million-strong population in the Philippines is unbanked, for a number of reasons; as Chris explained, some people don't have enough ID to open an account, while the fact that the country is made up of thousands of islands, many of them rural, has also meant it's difficult for banks to open enough branches to reach everyone. \"Filipino cities present their own challenges. Some cities have 20 or 25 million people. While a bank branch might seem close geographically, traffic and public transport make it extremely difficult to get around the country. Paying your bills or going to the bank in person can take all day, and not everyone can afford to take that time off work,\" he added. According to BusinessWorld, 2014 survey of 18,000 Filipino households found that the foremost reason cited by households for not having a deposit account was not having enough money to keep an account, with service fees or minimum deposits too high for some to afford; a number of respondents also stated that they did not like dealing with financial entities, with trust in institutions low. Of course, relying on cash can lead to its own problems, with Chris pointing to data from the World Bank that found people who use cash only can lose up to 25 percent a year through misplacement or theft. \"Relying on cash also prevents people from accessing loans which can help build small businesses and build the economy, and this is especially relevant for women, to whom 90 percent of microfinance lending is made,\" Chris said. That's where Peppermint comes in. The brothers in 2014 had travelled to the Philippines to look at TelUPay International, a mobile banking app whose developers had spent $9.5 million to deploy it through banks. \"Long story short, the company was falling over, and the shareholders who had money in this company were going to get nothing back; not to mention, their entire team was going to be out of a job,\" Chris said. \"And after all of that, this great idea, this great platform, would be just flapping loose. Well, we knew immediately that we had to take it on.\" Taking on the team, Peppermint began to work on the creation of a platform that could provide the same basic services as the existing app to those without bank accounts. The result is MyWeps, a mobile remittance platform. \"The idea is that the consumer can go to an agent, give them cash, and the agent then pays from their account to the payee, who might be an individual or a company. You can use it to pay bills or transfer money between people,\" Chris explained. The remittance model is a popular one in the Philippines, with a number of services in particular set up to allow people to collect from an agent or collection centre money sent by relatives overseas; these relatives can also pay their family's bills. Focusing on the local market, Peppermint's 'agents' are sent to homes around the country, providing bill payments services to people without bank accounts across the Philippines. As well as a partnership with agent service 1Bro Global, which has 90,000 agents across the country, Peppermint recently partnered with Metro Gas Sales, a domestic gas bottle delivery company, to have its delivery drivers become Peppermint agents, enabling them to take payments from the customers they visit for a variety of household bills. Peppermint takes a small percentage fee on each transaction, paid by the consumer. This model can work, Chris believes, because while 70 million people in the Philippines don't have a bank account, most have a mobile phone. \"If you don't have a bank account, your options for cashless transactions are really limited. Mobile wallets do exist, but most of these platforms require you to have a bank account, so these products just aren't accessible,\" he said. \"We learned fast that an agent model actually improved things, and created financial inclusion. A middleman actually made the service more convenient and accessible for a lot of people who might not have a smartphone yet, or who have mobile internet access in town but not at their home. It also creates accountability, a face, a representative to talk to if issues come up, which makes the service safer to use.\" Of course, Peppermint also operates more 'traditional' online banking apps for banks in the Philippines, currently being used by Metropolitan Bank and Trust, UnionBank, and UCPB. The company's growth was pushed along by its ASX listing in December 2015, a route Chris said he and brother Anthony took over venture capital as they were \"attracted to the financial reporting discipline, the corporate governance regime and the continuous disclosure obligations required by the ASX\". With a foothold in the Philippines, the business is now looking to expand into other markets across Southeast Asia, with Bangladesh at the top of the list. Despite the growth of the fintech sector in markets like Australia and the US, Chris said Peppermint is happy \"providing a real, tangible service that generates revenue\". \"This isn't brand new tech, there's other mobile payment operators around the world and we understand that. This wouldn't excite Silicon Valley, but our results are tangible and we're making a difference in a market that requires it.\" ",

      "content": "While the brightest tech minds among us set out to tackle complex questions about the ethics of technology such as artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles, the general public is left to deal with an arguably more difficult question - which is the best type of dog? For Olly's Box cofounder Drewe Apps, the question was met with hesitation and uncertainty, before he confessed that his favourite dog breed is a Cavoodle. That said, the entrepreneur has a massive soft spot for his cross Shih Tzu-Maltese Olly, a dog which inspired the name of his startup, Olly's Box. Through an online platform, the business offers a monthly subscription box for dogs, with each filled with four to five unique products designed to encourage dog owners to have fun with their pet, get active, and maintain a healthy lifestyle for human's best friend. \"We really want dogs to gain access the best life they can by encouraging their parents to get active with them,\" said Apps. Olly's Box was founded roughly three years ago by Apps and his partner, Jessica Burke, after they adopted Olly, their first dog together. Looking for new exciting ways to get active with their new pet, Apps said the couple became \"bored\" with the generic selection of chew toys and treats lining the shelves of pet stores and supermarket aisles. \"[Olly] got pretty bored with the same old toys too. We saw a gap in the market, and thought we'd look for a way to supply bundles of different products online and encourage people to teach their dogs new things and get outside and active,\" said Apps. While monthly subscription services like the geek-friendly Loot Crate and book-focused OwlCrate dominate much of the oversaturated global market, Apps said he couldn't see a lot of competition out there in the way of dog boxes, beyond a few players in the US. \"When we started there was no one else around in Australia, [just] companies in America. A few have entered the market since then, but none stick around for too long really,\" said Apps. To stand out from competition, the startup sought to focus on sourcing Australian-owned products to ensure their offering would cater to the local audience. To market the business, Apps said he and Burke took to social media. \"Starting off wasn't easy, it was a long slog. It wasn't so hard in terms of actual work, but rather how long it takes to build a trusted follower base. It definitely takes a while to build up an audience,\" said Apps. Apps added the business found particular success in photo-sharing platforms like Instagram, where the cofounders launched numerous competitions and campaigns which popularised the startup's flagship hashtag, '#AussieDogsRule'. The startup's Instagram has now amassed over 22,000 followers. \"There's also a weekly newsletter. The online presence and sharing gives people something to relate to and encourages them to listen when we recommend products. I think it made us successful over competitors,\" said Apps. To try and get dogs and their owners active, each box includes accessories designed for dogs to use on-the-go, such as walking belts and treat bags. According to Apps, customers can typically expect a box to contain two to three toys, a treat, and an accessory, with products varying month-to-month. An examples of an item found inside an Olly Box is a pre-dispensing food toy, which an owner stuffs with treats before giving it to their dog to try and gnaw out. Food products found inside the boxes can be changed to cater to each dog's dietary requirements, with Apps saying the startup has a number of vegan dog owners as customers. \"We also do special promotions for companies, often where we're the first to market with a new product. We recently helped launch a new Australian made all-natural Salmon Skin product from a great Australian company called Savourlife,\" Apps added. Boxes start from $50 and typically include $70-80 worth of value, according to Apps, with a few types of boxes available beyond the 'regular' monthly box. There's a 'Barkday Box' tailored for a dog's birthday, and also a Puppy Box designed for all breeds of puppies. \"This contains toys to help a puppy grow, so everything from toys for teething to accessories for getting a puppy moving on-the-go, like a travel bowl,\" Apps explained. Bootstrapping the startup, Apps said he and Burke have developed their own dispatch sorting platform to cater for several Australian delivery companies used, as well as the varying combination of dietary products included in each box. \"Building the platform was also a hard slog. There wasn't much around back then in terms of integrated online billing platforms for monthly subscriptions, so we had to work around it at first,\" said Apps. Since entering the market, Apps said Olly's Box has received customer interest internationally, particularly from Singapore and China. ",

      "content": "Sydney startup Recomazing first launched in mid-2015 as a platform to enable friends to find, make, and share business recommendations with their networks. Founder Marc Cowper remembered the excitement he felt seeing businesses register their interest on the platform's initial landing page ahead of launch; the team was \"filled with confidence\" as thousands of SMEs created profiles. In other words, everything was looking great. \"Then, shortly after our consumer launch, the reality that everything was going to be infinitely harder than we had anticipated started to sink in. We learned, like a lot of marketplace startups, that no amount of business engagement could make up for a lack of engagement on the consumer side,\" he admitted. \"We weren't hitting our forecasted acquisition rate or the required volume of recommendations. As a result, we weren't delivering enough value to our user base or our investors.\" After six months of looking at the data, Cowper said it became obvious that Recomazing's most engaged users were the businesses themselves: they wanted to increase word of mouth recommendations for their own business, but were even more active in searching for services to help themselves grow. The team's pondering of a pivot to a B2B focus was pushed by what they were seeing working out of Fishburners, where every day people would post on member channels asking for recommendations on various business tools and services. \"The problem with these channels was that the same questions got repeatedly asked, people with valuable recommendations stopped answering, and there was no shared knowledge bank between members,\" Cowper said. This, in turn, created a number of issues. As Cowper explained, startups were making the mistakes as those before them and choosing the wrong suppliers, while Fishburners' community manager, tasked with driving knowledge sharing between members, was spending a significant portion of their day trying to manually facilitate these conversations. This led Recomazing to create its community-based model, which allows startup communities to create a 'RecoHub', where members can save, search, and share recommendations for business growth. \"The startup community seemed like a natural fit for Recomazing. The learning curve for startups is incredibly steep, the constant introduction of new digital tools keeps the need for recommendations high, and the Australian startup ecosystem is in desperate need of better collaboration,\" Cowper said. While seeing the new model could solve clear issues, the decision to pivot and the process of making it happen wasn't easy. \"The most difficult part of pivoting was feeling like we were letting our existing users, partners, investors and clients down. We were so thankful and appreciative of our early adopters and we desperately wanted to repay their faith in us. On a personal level, it is something that I really took to heart and I still think about. I still have hope that as we grow, I will find a way to return the favour to those early personal relationships that were so pivotal to our success,\" Cowper explained. \"As a founder, I also felt like I had let my team down. I look at my team as my first investors and ultimately the decision on initial go-to-market strategy rested on my shoulders. Knowing I had failed them really motivated me to make it only a temporary speed bump instead of a permanent crash.\" Cowper credits his \"amazingly collaborative team\" for \"[working] their asses off\" to take on the development of the new beta while keeping the existing platform running smoothly. \"The main priority was that the entire team had full belief in [the pivot's] ability to drive success. Running a startup is hard bloody work and the entire team makes a lot of sacrifices on the belief that, against all odds, there will be a high reward at the end of it. If the team didn't believe in the pivot then there was no point continuing to make sacrifices.\" Also helping to make the pivot process easier was the data, which the team let itself trust. \"The simple truth is that numbers don't lie and they allow you to take all bias or resistance to change out of the equation. So when we saw every single key metric grow as a result of our beta, it made the decision to pivot very easy,\" Cowper said. The switching of the platform from B2C to B2B was met with a mixed response from Recomazing's existing user base, however, as it of course made the platform irrelevant for consumers and B2C clients. However, Cowper said the startup had the support of its investors in making the switch; key to gaining that support, however, was demonstrating that the team had full belief in the plan. \"They really appreciated the fact that we weren't just telling them our idea for a magical-all-problem-solving-pivot whilst putting our hand out for more funds. Instead we demonstrated the business case through data and generated a pipeline of over 40 global business communities who signed on to roll out their own RecoHubs,\" Cowper said. The startup also raised over $1 million in fresh funding from a mix of existing and new backers. The new iteration of the platform allows startups to browse recommendations generated from other community startups, and add their own recommendations on what tools and service they're using in their startup and why they have been helpful. The RecoHub feature also allows for members to search community or group-specific recommendations, with muru-D, Fintech Australia, and Fishburners among the existing RecoHubs. Looking to future growth, Cowper said the startup does not intend to ever monetise by charging individual users, rather will look at a model charging the businesses being recommended. \"In my prior life running digital marketing teams we worked with global brands who spent millions of dollars on word of mouth marketing campaigns to generate and track organic customer advocacy. It involved a lot of face to face events and experiential marketing but the ability to track genuine advocacy and not simply social likes and sharing was missing,\" he said. \"We have already been working with brands to monetise customer advocacy insights and amplification tools.\" Of course, there's no shortage of platforms allowing businesses to share recommendations around tools and services, whether they be local platforms or global, a simple Facebook group or a more formalised platform. Acknowledging this, Cowper believes Recomazing's point of difference is that it puts \"community collaboration at the heart of everything we do\". \"We personally work with experts to curate their content and align with community partners to ensure a sense of trust in the recommendation data. Startups have plenty of other things to worry about rather than whether a service is the right one for them or not,\" he explained. The startup will look to extend the value of the platform to members by incorporating features to allow them to tailor recommendations based on factors such as industry and the stage they are at. ",

      "content": "Perth-based online medical bookings startup HealthEngine has announced the closure of a $26.7 million Series C round led by Indian VC firm Sequoia India, which will be used to expand the company's team and expand its online offerings. The funding marks the first direct investment for the India-focused VC fund in an Australian-based and founded startup, since the firm emerged last year as a branch of global VC firm Sequoia Capital. As lead investor for the round, a Sequoia India representative will join the HealthEngine board alongside existing cornerstone investors Telstra Ventures and Seven West Media. Pieter Kemps, principal at Sequoia India, said the firm took interest in HealthEngine's \"technical and commercial\" potential to grow into a world-class business. \"Healthcare is an enormous sector ripe for innovation globally. HealthEngine has done particularly well to become a market leading digital health company in Australia,\" he said. \"They have built the foundation of a powerful health experience platform that improves the lives of patients as well as healthcare practitioners.\" Alongside Sequoia India, the round saw follow-up investment from Go Capital, the founders of Lux Group, and carsales.com.au founder Greg RoeBuck. A handful of new investors also contributed, including private equity fund Alium Capital, which also today announced its participation into Nitro's Us$15 million Series C round. The funds will be used to grow HealthEngine's 100-plus team, which spans across Perth, Melbourne, and Sydney, build out the startup's product portfolio, and open up opportunities for expansion into other markets as well as future acquisitions. Speaking about the raise, HealthEngine's CEO and Medical Director, Dr Marcus Tan, said the funds will help forward the startup's goal of improving the health of Australians. \"When we created HealthEngine, we wanted to break down the frustrations felt from both patients and practitioners trying to navigate the complex health system. We're empowering patients to access and manage their healthcare through better information and technology,\" he said. Founded in 2006, HealthEngine connects patients to health practitioners such as general practitioners, dentists, and psychologists and allows them to book sessions through an online platform. The startup has also formed a partnership with healthtech job search platform HealthcareLink, leveraging its platform to allow HealthEngine medical practitioners to find candidates for their practices. \"At over $160 billion per annum in expenditure, healthcare is one of Australia's largest industries making up around ten percent of our national GDP. The sector impacts every Australian but has been slow to adopt many of the advances we have become accustomed to in other industries,\" said Tan. \"[We look] to improve the health of all Australians by providing a platform that enables both timely access to quality care and a seamless patient experience.\" With the startup claiming approximately one million monthly active Australian users and practitioner monthly users in the tens of thousands, Tan said the business is now looking internationally thanks to acquiring an investment partner with a global \"breadth of expertise\". \"This investment [also] announces HealthEngine's arrival on the global startup scene, hopefully putting us on a similar trajectory to many of Sequoia's other successes; iconic companies like Apple and Google and more recently startups like Whatsapp, Stripe, and Airbnb.

      "content": "Just about every kind of product or service imaginable is now available to be bought or paid for online and delivered to your door, there's rarely any surprise now discovering new services. There are, however, services that are easily ignored because they're a little less flashy than, say, buying a car online and having it delivered to your home with a bow on the bonnet, and one of them is Clens, which allows users to buy new lenses for their glasses online and send their frames in for a swap-over. The platform looks to offer a cheaper and more accessible alternative to paying the weightier costs at an optometrist. The service is an offshoot of Australia-based ecommerce platform Sneaking Duck, an online frames and lenses business. The startup extends its products globally, offering free delivery anywhere in the world in addition to 12 months warranty and a free-return trial period for Australians. For one of the startup's cofounder, Kim Heras, developing Clens meant responding directly to the customer needs the team had come across through Sneaking Duck, as he explained the business saw \"tons\" of customers who wanted to \"upgrade\" their lenses without swapping their beloved frames. \"Over the years we did this as a 'secret service' for some of our best customers, but then requests for the service started coming through more and more frequently in line with the increased interest in recycling and upcycling,\" he said. \"We looked into the pure lens replacement market and realised that, while the full glasses market had been completely disrupted by companies like Warby Parker and Sneaking Duck, the lens replacement market was still more or less the same way it had been for decades.\" Sneaking Duck, which has offered its products online for roughly five years, was developed within startup studio 25Fifteen, \"a startup which builds startups\". The business collaborates with external founders as well as developing internal projects with the goal of commercialising new startup ideas. \"We also have the team at 25Fifteen as cofounders, which has brought incredible experience in starting and growing startups to the business from day one,\" said Heras. Discussing the perks of developing a new platform off the back of a successful ecommerce site with an established customer base, Heras said it has been \"amazing\" in helping the business navigate the early marketing and distribution issues most startups face early on. \"In terms of launching the new service to market, we're lucky in that there are tens of thousands of people who know, love, and have had some sort of direct interaction with Sneaking Duck who we were able to tell about Clens,\" he explained. \"From a technical point of view, Clens reuses much of the Sneaking Duck platform, that has, for five years, been one of the best online optical dispensing platforms in the world.\" Achieving success for the business, according to Heras, will come from a focus on customer service and ensuring a high quality of product, something which was established early on in the startup's lifetime in 25Fifteen. \"[It was] an approach that was built into our DNA early by our cofounders Mark Capps, Mike Knapp, Michael Fox, and Jodie Fox,\" he said. Within both of platforms, users are able to claim back their purchases, as the business is set up as an authorised provider for all major health funds. New lenses start from $90 for both standard and non-prescription products, with each including anti-scratch, anti-glare, and UV protection coatings in addition to the free shipping. The platform, like Sneaking Duck, works by having a consumer first go to their optometrist to get their prescription, which they can then send through to the Clens, or have Clens get it directly from the optometrist. Once this is done, they can select what type of lens they need. They then receive a reply paid package and information detailing where to send their glasses for servicing, at which point the lens are fitted in and sent back. Heras said the process typically takes around five days within most capital cities, extending longer for more \"complicated lenses\" and distant locations. With a new service on the market, Heras said the business hasn't yet raised despite receiving \"inbound interest\", although that may change depending on the speed at which the business grows its partnerships. Currently, Heras said Clens has three undisclosed partners that the business offers its services to, with \"good interest\" from other international and local parties signalling the potential for more partnerships in future. As for sales, Heras said he has a \"key metric\" of how many prescription lenses the startup aims to create this year, which will act as a key objective for the business moving forward. ",

      "content": "ASX-listed logistics company GetSwift has today announced the signing of a multi-year partnership with Commonwealth Bank (CBA) that will see its software integrated into the bank's Albert POS system. This will allow any vendor using the point-of-sale system to essentially become a delivery-ready store, with GetSwift automatically queueing, batching, routing, and dispatching the delivery of any products purchased through an Albert POS. Delivery can be outsourced to logistics companies within GetSwift's network, or pushed through to the merchant's own delivery team. Drivers within GetSwift's network will be equipped with an Albert terminal or associated device, meaning customers will be able to pay for goods on arrival instead of ahead of time; the company believes this will incentivise better delivery processes and reduced wait time. GetSwift estimates that the partnership will result in 257.4 million deliveries through its platform over the next five years, translating to an aggregate transaction value of $9 billion. There are currently 75,000 Albert terminals across Australia. Bane Hunter, executive chairman of GetSwift, called the deal a \"game changer\" for the Australian retail sector, saying CBA is \"charting new territory\". \"This integration will take delivery from being a fringe benefit to a norm for Australian retail, and will usher in a new era of convenience for shoppers,\" he said. \"For vendors, it's a cost effective way of tackling the threat from Amazon, Foodora, UberEats, Deliveroo and other global technology companies attempting to capture this space, and charge retailers a significant premium for the benefit of what is becoming an expected service.\" The organisations will also work together to develop new solutions through Albert and other devices. As well as the partnership with GetSwift, CBA has also today announced the launch of Daily IQ 2.0, an analytics platform to help businesses monitor their performance in real time, view customer purchasing and demographic trends, and model future scenarios based on current financial and industry data. Provided free to CBA customers through integrations with its NetBank portal and business banking platform CommBiz, the bank stated the platform combines analysis of key financial metrics within a business, such as income and cash-in-hand, sales trends, and profitability, with insights into the purchasing behaviours of CBA's own customers, including repeat purchases, average spend, age, and location. Claire Roberts, CBA's executive general manager of Business Banking SME, said through the platform, the bank aims to empower SMEs to take advantage of its transaction information to understand the risks and opportunities for their business. \"SMEs are constantly being told about the benefits of big data, but the reality is that many don't know where to start or have the time or expertise to produce insights that actually impact their day to day decision-making,\" Roberts said. The deal for GetSwift comes a few weeks after it added \"the godfather of venture capital in the US\", Sig Mosley and John Wilson, a scientist, investor, and tech executive, to its board as senior advisors. Former Qantas CIO, Jamila Gordon also joined the company earlier this year as its global CIO, tasked with leading the company's digital vision, overseeing all client integration, and ensuring the stability and security of the GetSwift platform. The company is working with businesses in over 300 cities around the world, among them US grocery delivery startup Instacart, and Australian fast food company QSRH, which owns chains including Red Rooster and Oporto.

      "content": "Nitro, the Melbourne-founded, San Francisco-based document productivity startup, has raised US$15 million ($19.7 million) in a Series C round led by existing backer Battery Ventures, with participation from local investors Regal Funds Management and Alium Capital. The startup, founded in 2005 as an alternative to the category leader Adobe Acrobat, allows users to easily create, edit, annotate, convert, collaborate on, sign, and share PDFs. It has raised a total of just over US$36 million to date, with a US$6.6 million Series A round coming from Australia's Starfish Ventures in 2012 and a US$15 million Series B round having come in November 2014. Sam Chandler, founder and CEO of Nitro, said the support from investors puts the company in a strong position to fulfil its growth ambitions in the enterprise as it continues to scale its operations globally, with the funding to be put towards expansion and R&D efforts. Alongside its San Francisco headquarters and Melbourne presence, the company in 2014 opened an office in Dublin. Nitro now boasts over eight million users monthly users at 600,000 companies worldwide, among them half the Fortune 500; its largest customer came on board last week, adding 20,000 users. Locally, the company saw an increase of 55 percent in year-on-year sales across the Asia-Pacific region last year, with customers including Bluescope Steel and the Australian Bureau of Statistics coming on board. Nitro's growth has also been fuelled by a partnership established in 2012 with Lenovo, with Nitro coming pre-installed on select Lenovo desktop and laptop computers globally, and the acquisition of doxIQ in 2015 to boost its analytics capabilities. Rejeev Gupta, partner at Alium Capital, said, \"Nitro's growth opportunities are driven by global enterprises demanding flexible tools for creating, sharing, and collaborating with documents. Adobe led this category for years, and we believe it is now Nitro's time to dominate in document productivity and workflow.\" Ben McCallum, portfolio manager at Regal Funds Management, added, \"Nitro has successfully transformed from an Australian startup with an online product, to a globally respected enterprise software company providing a digital transformation platform to some of the largest companies in the world.\" The participation of Alium Capital, which also announced today its investment into Australian startup HealthEngine, and Regal Funds in the Series C marks a return to Australian investment for the startup; after raising the Series B from Battery Ventures in 2014, Chandler told Startup Daily that the US was \"\"the only place we could raise $15m with the potential to raise tens of millions more if we ever wanted to\". He said, \"If we want to go really big, US VCs run much bigger funds than anywhere else in the world, and are more experienced at later stage investing where that operational expertise really helps.\" Much has changed since then, of course, with Square Peg Capital last month announcing it had raised a $235 million fund and AirTree Ventures late last year locking in $250 million.

      "content": "The Sharing Hub, a coworking hub and community founded by four founders of sharing economy startups, has launched in Sydney's Pyrmont to help foster the development of the sector. It comes as a report from Deloitte, commissioned by the NSW government, estimated that revenues of businesses in the state's sharing - or collaborative, as the report puts it - economy grew to $2.6 billion in 2015-16, up from $1.6 billion in 2014-15. The number of people earning through \"key\" platforms in the sector also doubled in the year, reaching 92,400. The founders of the Sharing Hub, Mike Rosenbaum, cofounder and CEO of Spacer; Steve Orenstein, CEO of founder of Zoom2u; cofounder and CEO of MadPaws, Alexis Soulopoulos; and Will Davies, CEO of Car Next Door, first came together last year to share their experiences and learnings with each other. \"We had a bunch of similar challenges. We informally met up, a year ago, every month to discuss our common challenges, and we found that very often the problems we were discussing were very specific to marketplaces, such as the chicken or the egg problem; should we first recruit MadPaws sitters or MadPaws pet owners, Spacer hosts or Spacer customers?\" Soulopoulos said. \"Before we knew it there were about 20 people doing these informal catch ups, and we were always moving from one place to the other so we thought, let's formalise this and make it big.\" The community has now grown to 28 startups, a number of which will now be housed at the Sharing Hub space. Here the focus will be on mentorship and encouraging collaboration with government. \"We want to grow the sharing economy as a whole, and how we do that is not only by helping the startups grow but also aligning with government. I think this is a very new space for Australia's startup ecosystem, yet it's growing super rapidly, and in order to ensure that growth is great for the consumer and stays great for the consumer is to align with government,\" Soulopoulos said. The NSW government has made efforts to embrace the sector over the last year; after announcing it would be regulating ridesharing services in December 2015, it released a position paper last year outlining a framework to regulate the wider sharing economy in the state, highlighting the \"positive impact of the collaborative economy for consumer choice, employment, and productivity\". Soulopoulos said, \"I think it's important that we have the dialogue with government; when they are making policies we'd like them to get insights on what's actually happening from us, and it seems they're supportive of that, but what's also important is, what data does the government have? Stats are crucial to quantify the industry and show people that this is a really big space and it's growing super fast.\" According to the Deloitte report, financial services platforms saw the most growth, with revenue growing by 345 percent from 2014-15 to 2015-16; transportation and automotive services, led by Uber, grew by 242 percent, while goods and redistribution services such as eBay grew by 67 percent. Accommodation services have grown by 55 percent, led by Airbnb's booming presence in Sydney, which is now the world's fifth largest market for the business with 4,500 hosts; the city was ranked 10th in 2015. Sydney had 262,000 inbound guests in the year, representing growth of 106 percent year-on-year. With the potential of the sector significant, the Sharing Hub founders will also be working with the University of Sydney Business School to help educate students about sharing economy businesses, with plans to create a graduate program.

The group's founding members are Complii, identitii, GRC Solutions, Arctic Intelligence, Verifier, Dynamic GRC, Dysrupt Labs, Meetig8, Simple KYC, Cynopsis Solutions, AML Accelerate, and Red Marker, which was recently acquired by global education company Kaplan. At the association's launch, CRC Solutions CEO and chair of the Regtech Association, Julian Fenwick, said the association marks an important step in \"getting the conversation started\" about building strong performing compliant businesses in an age where regulatory parameters are on the rise. \"The financial sector is evolving, with companies embracing regtech to solve complex regulatory issues. Regtech has the power to revolutionise business through a close to real-time solution that delivers greater efficiencies,\" he said. \"By bringing regtechs together to form the association...our vision is to collaborate, advocate, educate, and support the sector and broader business community.\" Elaborating on what \"collaboration\" for industry would look like, Mark Adams, senior executive leader at the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), said regulators and regtech companies will aim to work together in order to navigate regulatory roadblocks. \"Regulators need to nurture relationships with regtechs and better understand what they do. Through ongoing liaison and engagement, we can transfer knowledge and truly make a difference together,\" said Adams. There has been a tightening of regulations across much of the financial sector as of late, most recently with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority implementing stricter limitations on banks issuing higher-risk loans on residential mortgages. The repercussions of increased regulations was mentioned as an issue in the latest performance review of Australia's innovation system from Innovation and Science Australia, which identified regulatory restrictions in a number of specific areas. Discussing the topic of regulation at the launch event, Fenwick said supporting existing regtech startups that are innovating in the space through collaboration is key to maintaining Australia's strong financial sector. \"$80 billion is spent on governance risk and compliance globally. The Australian financial sector is the largest contributor to the Australian economy, yet it's struggling to keep up with stricter regulation and compliance requirements. Regtechs are paving the way for disruptive change,\" he said. \"The way forward is through a unified, cross-industry focus on how regtechs can improve business as a whole, and not just in Australia, but globally.\" The emergence of the niche Regtech Association follows the launch of fintech industry body Fintech Australia early last year.

      "content": "Having the ability to see a list of everyone 'attending' a party or get-together posted on social media is a double-edged sword. While it's an easy way to see if people you know are going, hitting 'attending' doesn't necessarily mean someone is going to show up, meaning there's always a decent chance you'll find yourself alone at a venue playing 'pretend-to-know-the-host'. Looking to fix this problem by streamlining the way attendees pay and mark their attendance to events, Sydney-startup Qnect Technologies has developed a \"social payments\" platform. Targeting university societies first up, the Qnect app and web platform allows users to browse through events where the 'attending' list only reveals those who have paid for a ticket. Using Facebook's API, the platform's algorithm will suggest to a user events to attend based on the activities being attended by their friends, while also allowing ticket-holders to enter into a private chatroom to discuss the event and connect post-partying. Dubbed as \"social ticketing\" by the startup's cofounder, Daniel Liang, the feature is intended to make event-going both an exciting and organised experience. For Liang, a once-avid event organiser, developing Qnect meant filling many of the gaps he saw in the organisational process. \"I started doing nightclub events, and quickly realised people only really go if they know their friends are going. But clicking 'attending' on an event doesn't actually mean anything. I also saw that when people met someone, they wanted to chat with them right away,\" said Liang. With the idea of developing a ticketing platform for nightclub events in mind, Liang and cofounder Ryan Cheng entered the University of New South Wales' Peter Farrell Cup, a student pitching event that led the young founder to walk away with a small-pocket of prize money to fund development after earning second place. \"That gave us a lot of confidence. We then created the machine learning feature where users get recommended events based on what their friends have tickets too. We also earned a $20,000 grant from government to help fund development,\" said Liang. Noticing a substantial organisational gap within the university space Liang had been a part of while studying, the startup shifted development away from nightclubs and towards university societies, a change which Liang said helped fuel Qnect's growth. Since its founding in 2015, according to Liang, the business has sprouted to 51,000 users and sold over 300,000 tickets, with the entrepreneur adding the startup takes a five to 10 percent cut of each ticket sold, with the exact figure depending on the size of the event. To join Qnect and integrate their friends list, a user connects their Facebook to the platform after selecting which university they're a part of. Liang said this data is implemented into the platform's algorithm to detail events relevant to a user's university, however, it's still possible to access other universities' events based off friend's attendance or by using the search option. To mirror a society's private Facebook group or page, users are able to create 'crews', which acts as the equivalent of a friends list. Crews are able to chat privately or view which events other members are attending. In order to actually be marked as 'attending' an event, a user must first purchase a ticket, which can be done through the app or offline, in which case Liang said the event host will provide a physical ticket and mark the guest as 'attending' on the platform. Tickets can be purchased in quantities and sent out to friends as a 'gift', or resold on the platform to another user at a discounted price. Event organisers are then able to monitor the total attendance numbers, payments, and create new events using the web platform. \"You can also become a 'follower' of an event organiser too, so you can track the events they host next, rather than having to rely on Facebook ads or shares re-advertise every time there's something on,\" Liang said. While discussing Qnect's features, Liang said each was developed with competitors in mind. The startup's direct competition, according to Liang, is Eventbrite, which offers tools for event organisers to create an event, share it on social media, and allow attendees to pay online. Where Qnect differentiates, Liang said, is the platform's \"social ticketing\" feature and its potential to foster connection between attendees, as well as the ability for users to search for events they're interested in. Another startup looking to tackle the problem of low attendance is Wellington's SuchCrowd. The startup works by having an event planner push out a proposition of an event, and if a large enough audience responds with interest and buys a ticket, the event will go ahead. Looking towards other revenue streams, Liang said Qnect has also added an advertising feature for organisers, achieved through sending push notifications about a sponsored event or sending an invite to a user's Facebook email address. While continuing to build out the app's features, Liang said the business will look to conduct another round of funding to support development, following $600,000 raised in seed funding. ",

      "content": "After striking a last-minute deal with the three Nick Xenophon Team (NXT) senators on Friday evening, the government saw a number of the tax cuts for businesses proposed in its 2016 Budget passed by the Senate. A company tax cut will have companies with an annual turnover of up to $10 million pay tax at a rate of 27.5 percent, a reduction of 2.5 percent for the current financial year. As of the 2017-18 financial year the drop will be extended to companies turning over up to $25 million, and to those turning over up to $50 million in the 2018-19 financial year. The government's full 10 year plan would see the lower rate applied to all corporate tax entities by the 2023-24 financial year, and further reduced in stages to 25 percent for all entities by the 2026-27 financial year. In a joint media release, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Treasurer Scott Morrison, and Finance Minister Matthias Cormann said, \"Company tax is a tax on workers, a tax on jobs and a tax on wages...this reform will deliver jobs and increase wages. It is an excellent outcome for Australian workers and their families.\" It's estimated that 870,000 Australian companies with a turnover of less than $10 million, employing 3.4 million people, will benefit from the cuts, with 10,000 more to benefit when the cuts are extended to those turning over up to $50 million. The cuts were agreed upon by NXT's senators in exchange for a range of concessions around energy prices, including one-off payments to pensioners to help them pay their electricity bills. The government has also agreed to look at other measures including increasing gas supply, accelerating solar development, and an inquiry from the Productivity Commission. The cuts have had a positive reaction from the business community, with Jennifer Westacott, CEO of the Business Council of Australia, called Friday's news an \"historic step towards rebooting Australia's international competitiveness and prosperity\". Tim Reed, CEO of MYOB, agreed, \"The confirmed changes will encourage small business to invest, take on more employees and grow. It's a good day for Australian small to medium sized businesses, their employees and the whole community.\" Reed believes that, thanks to the cuts, SMEs will be encouraged to grow beyond $2 million in revenue. \"We hope the Government is able to secure support for its ongoing programme of company tax cuts. The simple fact is that lower corporate taxes across the board would have made Australian business more internationally competitive,\" he said. Westacott also warned on Sky News that the two-tier company tax system may see growing businesses look at \"doing business planning for tax planning and that's the main thing\". \"You start carving off bits of your business because if we're going to 25 per cent, it's quite material,\" she said. Looking at startups, Bane Hunter, executive chairman at GetSwift, said, the changes will help enable business growth \"at the smaller end of town\". \"Tax manoeuvres like this encourage international companies like us to employ more people in Australia than elsewhere. When you are paying tax in more than one country, whether it's Australia, the US or the UK, tax cuts like this are a strong incentive to build the business more in Australia,\" he said. \"But ideally, a slightly more aggressive tax cut for smaller companies would be more beneficial. Small companies have the highest potential for failure, but at the same time have the highest potential for strong and sustained job creation. More importantly, they are a critical element of a well-functioning business community.\" The Opposition, which has opposed tax cuts for businesses turning over more than $2 million, has refused to disclose whether it will repeal the cuts if it wins the next election, leading to the government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) today calling on the ALP to make its position known. The tax cuts and discussion around jobs and wages growths comes after the Opposition won support from Senate cross benchers last week to pass a bill preventing cuts to Sunday penalty rates. With the bill being introduced into the Senate, it will now head to the House of Representatives. ",

      "content": "The sharing economy has come a long way over the last few years: a report on the sector in NSW released by Deloitte has found that revenues in the sector grew from an estimated $1.6 billion in 2014-15 to $2.6 billion in 2015-16. The number of people earning income from these platforms has also doubled from 45,000 to 92,400 as acceptance of and trust in the sharing economy grows. Looking to take advantage of this growth is DishMe, a peer-to-peer home cooking startup founded by Pushpinder Bagga, Simran Gambhir, Richard Fleming, and Eric So. The idea for DishMe came over a year ago when Bagga found himself struggling with his health due to what his doctor described as \"a lethal combination of poor diet and long work hours\". \"Unable to cook, on top of my demanding work schedule, I regularly gave in to takeout food and packaged meals from supermarket shelves. Keeping the cautions of my doctor in mind if I continued with this bad habit, I had an idea of posting an ad to my community bulletin board for healthy homemade meals throughout the week,\" Bagga explained. \"I received four offers from local chefs who I exchanged texts with to collect food. Getting bored of eating the limiting food they were offering, I began requesting meals with particular taste preferences and specific ingredients. Two chefs dropped out and two remained for the challenge. I eventually told my friends about this and they began ordering custom meals as well, birthing the idea and concept of DishMe.\" As the DishMe team came together, Bagga said one of the biggest challenges for the startup has been determining a specific target audience, and then communicating to this audience the services and products it's offering. After conducting multiple trials to validate the concept, DishMe partnered with an insurance provider to start operating as a business. The startup's defined target audience is comprised of busy 40-something professionals who struggle with finding the time to cook and maintain a healthy lifestyle. \"Since the market for personal chefs is typically exclusive and expensive, our current proposals dominate the competition both in price and convenience. In respect to our value proposition, we are the world's first online marketplace of its kind and prioritise our customers by assessing local chefs with local sustainable, healthy, limitless and efficient food,\" Bagga said. According to Bagga, DishMe's focus is not profiting off customers but rather prioritising the \"uniqueness and individuality\" of each of its customers. \"Unlike typical businesses who centre in profiting the business by profiting off customers, DishMe efforts in prioritising on the uniqueness and individuality in each of our customers. Bagga said the startup has over 150 chefs registered in Sydney awaiting launch. After registering online, DishMe takes a chef through a vetting process including an interview, \"taste approval\", and kitchen inspection. The startup then takes photos and video to assist in the \"branding\" of a chef. DishMe also sets prices for chefs in order to maintain consistency and ensure a level playing field of sorts on its platform, ensuring chefs are focused on serving quality food rather than fixated on price, Bagga explained. Consumers, meanwhile, will be able to sign up and note their dietary requirements, then be taken to the marketplace where they can browse chefs in their area and chat to those they are interested in before placing an order. DishMe will take a 20 percent cut of every transaction. Consumers will be able to pick up the food themselves or have it delivered by the chef; Bagga said the startup will look to partner with a logistics company in the future to facilitate delivery. DishMe recently made its way into the latest intake of the H2 Accelerator run by H2 Ventures, which has traditionally been fintech-focused. In a blog post calling for applications earlier this year, founding partner of H2 Ventures Toby Heap explored the different spaces the accelerator would be looking to explore this year, with peer-to-peer marketplaces one of them. \"P2P marketplaces such as Uber, AirBnB and Freelancer have fundamentally shaken entire industries to their cores by shifting the power dynamic from intermediaries to consumers. We consider that the defining feature of these marketplace businesses is that they allow an efficient and convenient financial transaction between peers, without requiring a traditional trusted intermediary,\" Heap wrote. \"Two sided marketplaces also have the distinct advantage that they have built in network effects providing potential durable competitive advantages. We especially like marketplaces that leverage consumer collective bargaining as part of their approach.\" It was his cofounder Gambhir that advocated for applying to the accelerator, Bagga said, and two months in, DishMe is benefiting from the advice and networking links of the program, as well as the $100,000 in seed funding. The support from the accelerator will surely come in handy, with DishMe trying to make headway in a crowded space; it's competing with everything from restaurants to delivery services such as Deliveroo and Foodora, 'meal box' companies like Marley Spoon and HelloFresh, and peer-to-peer home cook startup FoodByUs, launched last year by a team including former Menulog managing director Gary Munitz. FoodByUs and now DishMe are following in the footsteps of a number of similar startups that have found the model difficult to scale: there was YourFork, which launched and operated for a short time in 2013; Welcome Over, which allows users to effectively host dinner parties for neighbours in 'pop up home restaurants' but does not currently show any listings; and Neighbour Flavour, which has yet to properly launch. As it progresses through the H2 Accelerator program, Bagga said the startup is focused on launching in and growing throughout Sydney. ",

      "content": "Describing it as an \"innovative\" technological industry that will help build a \"strong and viable Australian export sector\", a report released late last year identified Australia's game development sector as one ripe for growth, predicting it to expand alongside a US$98 billion global industry in the next two years. Kim Allom, a producer at Brisbane gaming startup Defiant Development, took to the (thankfully dry) Myriad Festival stage today to discuss the state of the Australian industry, and address the challenges gaming startups face. Speaking to Startup Daily ahead of the event, Allom shed light on how lack of government support and funding opportunities are restricting the emergence of new startups in the space. \"There is a place where government funds should be available to kickstart a project so you can then access a funding by other means, but there really isn't enough there,\" she said. As a producer for Defiant Development, Allom is well immersed in the industry as well as the development of projects, acting as both a promoter and marketer, a team manager, and sometimes even a \"therapist\", she joked. \"It's kind of like a glorified way of saying project manager. The goal is to make sure the team is working on the most important thing, but not at the expense of quality of product or quality of life,\" Allom explained. The startup itself has been around for a number of years, working on external, contract-based projects before shifting towards the development of its own intellectual property (IP), including its flagship title Hand of Fate. Released in 2015 on Xbox, Playstation, and computer (PC) platforms, the card-cross-action game has had over 2.5 million purchased downloads to date, with the startup now moving to work on the sequel, Hand of Fate 2. While the business found success with the release, Allom explained that getting the IP out to market was not an simple or fast path, but rather one than took roughly 18 months with a team of over 10 people. Funding for the project came from a grant from Screen Australia, internal funding from prior projects, and a Kickstarter campaign. \"We're actually one of, if not the first Australian game development company, to successfully pull off a Kickstarter campaign,\" she said. Looking at other small-scale startups working in the space, Allom said a lot aren't able to successfully reach the crowdfunding target and continue project development, an issue that is accentuated by the lack of other funding opportunities available. According to Allom, aside from a handful of grants from Screen Australia, which themselves are shared amongst other creative media projects, there are precious little other grants, accelerators, incubators or private funding opportunities out there targeted at supporting game development startups. As a result, Allom said the gaming startup community has looked to support to each other instead. \"Local gaming developers that are successful and have grown larger are actually funding each other now. There are also events like Game Jam where the leaders in the space give a lot of mentoring support, which can sometimes be more beneficial than monetary support,\" she said. \"Unless you're from Melbourne, which has a pretty extensive funding model thanks to FilmVic, which funds all sorts of projects including gaming, you pretty much have to source funding yourself.\" While government and other organisations are looking to take steps towards developing initiatives to support the industry, Allom said that although a lot does gets talked about, \"not a lot happens\". The last government initiative emerged in 2012, when the Labor Government introduced the Interactive Games Fund to help gaming startups kick their project off the ground. A Senate inquiry investigating the future of Australia's game development industry launched in 2015 handed down its report in April last year, putting forth a number of recommendations to grow the industry. No Federal action has been taken to date, however. Allom believes the funding issue is part of the reason a number of Australia's gaming startups have been working with mobile app titles in the last few years, which are generally cheaper to make thanks to their shorter development time and the ability to see \"how things are progressing early on\". A survey from the Interaction Games & Entertainment Association and Games Development Association of Australia issued to local game developer startups showed that majority received their income from iOS and Android platforms, with PC following closely behind. According to Allom, however, there is now a shift away from mobile titles towards PC and console platforms. \"There is now a change in the landscape where developers are starting to move away from mobile to other platforms, which can probably be attributed to a lot of saturation in the mobile market,\" she said. \"There's now also a lot of sub-support from Microsoft and Sony for smaller developers. Microsoft in particular has a lot of promotion opportunities available to get a product out there.\" Looking to empower new startups in the space, Microsoft also launched the [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ program in 2014, which offers developers free access to two modern dev-kits or softwares, the same that are used to construct big-title games. This year the company also announced that it will be launching another program dubbed 'Xbox Live Creators', that will streamline a developer's ability to implement features that allow players to game together online for a one-time cost.
