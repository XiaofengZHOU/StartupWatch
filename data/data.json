      "title": "As DJI dominates camera and commercial drone sales, drone funding falls",
      "content": "According to AgFunder's 2016 AgTech Investing Report (supported by The Robot Report's own research), 2016 drone funding fell 64% from 2015 levels. Also, the types of UAS companies that got funded weren't drone makers.In 2015, according to AgFunder, the largest drone deal was DJI\u2019s $75 million followed by 3D Robotics\u2019 $64 million. In 2016, the largest deal was 3D Robotics\u2019 $27 million and the majority of drone tech deals closed during the year were seed stage (15 out of 25), whereas there was an even split between late and seed stage deals in 2015.The Robot Report's year-end article: 2016 best year ever for funding robotics startup companies included 27 UAS deals. The largest was for $43.8 million to a meds drone delivery service, Zipline International. The 2nd largest was $30 million to Airware, to fund their acquisition of Redbird (a French drone-powered analytics provider) and development of a set of technology systems to plan, fly, and analyze aerial data - particularly valuable for insurance adjusters and contractors. Then came 3D Robotics' $27 million which helped them wind down and reconfigure themselves from a drone maker to a drone services provider.The mix of companies receiving funding in 2016 was different than in 2015 where the big money went to drone makers: DJI ($75M) 3D Robotics ($64M), Yuneec Electric Aviation ($60M), Ehang ($44M), and CyPhy Works ($25.4M).2017 fundings continue the 2016 pattern: Drone Delivery raised $8.1M to further their depot to depot delivery system, Flytrex raised $3M to manufacture drone components, Flirty, a medicine and food delivery drone startup got $16M, Measure got $15M for their drones-as-a-service company for insurers, AirMap got $26M for a real-time air traffic management system, Dedrone got $15M for a drone tracking system, Airware raised an additional but undisclosed sum and Arbe Robotics got $2.5M for a real-time drone mapping system. No drone makers in the lot!DJI is by far the leading quadcopter maker in the world. At a recent drone trade show, most of the booths that displayed multi-rotor drones doing specialized tasks used DJI drones to demonstrate their products. As drones are becomming less of a flying camera and hobby and more to provide commercial and industrial services, DJI is still leading the pack.According to Bloomberg Businessweek, DJI is valued at $10 billion and makes 60-65% of all non-military drones. DJI designs, prototypes and manufacturers all their products in their own factories in Shenzhen and all their sub-contractors are in Shenzhen as well. Thus they control the supply chain and can produce new drones every 6 months thereby whipping the competition. Very Apple-like (after which they pattern themselves).Nevertheless, even DJI has seen the change from drone-making to providing meaningful services with drones. It\u2019s tough to maintain momentum with just hardware no matter how good it is. DJI, while continuing to develop new products and upgraded versions of their drones, has suffered the same limitations as other makers and service providers: limited battery life, regulations regarding line of sight and autonomy, connectivity issues, image processing and analysis, limited payload capacity and the commoditization of drones themselves. But, as Paul Turner, CEO of AgDNA wrote recently on Medium:\u201cOnce drones are able to take off autonomously, scan a field [or object], upload data, recharge and continue operation without human intervention\u200a\u2014\u200athis will be a game changer.\u201dWe're almost there.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "The changing landscape of mobility as seen at Automate and ProMat",
      "content": "America's retailers are closing stores faster than ever while demand for warehouse workers by online retailers is higher than ever. Retailers and logistics companies have been opening facilities at a record pace and in this fast-paced world, warehousing and logistics managers are looking for robotics solutions to remain competitive.UPDATED 4/18/2017 to show Chinese entry into mobile robot race. See below.Chicago's huge McCormick Place Conference Center was once again home to the Automate and ProMat trade shows. ProMat for material handling solutions; Automate for robotics. Over 900 exhibitors covered 350,000 sq ft at ProMat while 400+ companies exhibited at the Automate show. Most of the companies listed below exhibited at one or both of these two shows.According to an article in The Wall Street Journal, the warehousing and logistics sectors are expanding dramatically as more people shop online. The two sectors accounted for 945,200 jobs in March, up 5.3% over 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Tractica, a market intelligence firm, forecasts revenue for the two sectors will grow exponentially and reach $22.4 billion by the end of 2021.Hence the many new mobility products at the ProMat show and the mood of the attendees to be buyers/adopters rather than looky-loos.Two years ago there was little discussion and promotion of bare-bones mobile robots although there were many guided AGVs, forklifts, self-driving vision kits and speciality tows as well as mobile picking solutions.This time there were lots of new vendors and much discussion about mobility and point-to-point mobile platforms to carry everything from cases to pods to shelves. Danish startup MiR (Mobile Industrial Robots) is on track to sell 600 mobile robots this year, up from 200 in 2016. Fetch, the Silicon Valley startup offering a pick and deliver solution, has altered their business plan as their clients have expressed needs that can be met with two new simple Freight robot platforms carrying loads from 500 to 1,500 kilograms plus their existing mini-carrier for loads under 80kg. Clearpath and their OTTO robots, like Fetch, carry loads up to 1,500kg. All deliver their loads safely with lights, bells and signals that interact with humans in their path. And all rely on user companies to customize what's carried, the payload, where the payload is to go, and what special fixtures are needed to hold, grab, slide, and otherwise handle the goods being carried.Clearpath, Fetch and MiR have discovered a market segment of point-to-point deliveries and pickups using a basic mobile platform and letting the end user add any needed shelves or fixtures. All three companies are reaping the benefits of this marketplace by a rising number of orders from both industrial and warehousing sources.Although there were many startups attempting to fill the void left by Kiva Systems as their goods-to-man system was taken inhouse by Amazon, many of those companies are finding resistance to their picking solutions because users prefer to use humans for that operation because they are faster and more accurate. But these same end-users want help moving picked items, consequently the interest in bare-bones mobile robotic platforms as \"gofor's.\" These mobile platforms all use various systems of navigational awareness with lights and beeps to interact with humans. Colors (white, red, orange and green) plus blinking to indicate turning and other warnings; beeping to indicate backing up, etc. [NOTE: Amazon didn't exhibit their warehouse systems and services at either show.]Below is a list of some of those mobile platform providers (and a few that didn't exhibit at either show). There were many other AGV, lift and mobile manipulator providers exhibiting at the two shows which may be profiled in a future article. The following providers offer mobile solutions but don't offer robotic platforms as separate products:This news video shows hundreds of orange robots from Chinese company Hanzhou Hikrobot Technology sorting packages at a mailing center. Although they weren't present at either of the two shows in Chicago, they are selling their mobile flipper robots all over China.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Bosch and Nvidia partner to develop AI for self-driving cars",
      "content": "Amongst all the activity in autonomously driven vehicle joint ventures, new R&D facilities, strategic acquisitions (such as Mobileye being acquired by Intel) and booming startup fundings, two big players in the industry, NVIDIA and Bosch, are partnering to develop an AI self-driving car supercomputer.Bosch CEO Dr. Volkmar Denner announced the partnership during his keynote address at Bosch Connected World, in Berlin.\"Automated driving makes roads safer, and artificial intelligence is the key to making that happen,\" said Denner. \"We are making the car smart. We are teaching the car how to maneuver through road traffic by itself.\"The Bosch AI car computer  will use NVIDIA AI PX technology, the upcoming AI car superchip, advertised as the world's first single-chip processor designed to achieve Level-4 autonomous driving (see ADAS chart). The unprecedented level of performance is necessary to handle the massive amount of computation required for the various tasks self-driving vehicles must perform which include running deep neural nets to sense surroundings, understanding the 3D environment, localizing themselves on an HD map, predicting the behavior and position of other objects, as well as computing car dynamics and a safe path forward.Essentially, the NVIDIA platform enables vehicles to be trained on the complexities of driving, operated autonomously and updated over the air with new features and capabilities. And Bosch, which is the one of the world's largest auto parts makers, has the Tier 1 credentials to mass-produce this AI-enabled supercomputer for a good portion of the auto industry.\"Self-driving cars is a challenge that can finally be solved with recent breakthroughs in deep learning and artificial intelligence,\" said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and CEO, NVIDIA. \"Using DRIVE PX AI car computer, Bosch will build automotive-grade systems for the mass production of autonomous cars. Together we will realize a future where autonomous vehicles make mobility safe and accessible to all.\"Today's most advanced cars use about half a teraflop of computing power (a measure of the ability of the computer to calculate 1 trillion floating-point operations per second). This will rise to around 50 teraflops in cars equipped with Level 4 self-driving systems (Level 4 is fully capable of driving the car with no human intervention, but only under specific circumstances. Brake pedal and steering wheel must be present. Most of the Level 4 systems under development depend on highly detailed maps and are thus geofenced, or limited to operating in mapped areas.)The NVIDIA AI PX chip presently works at 11 teraflops speed but Nvidia plans to improve the chip and increase its speed to handle Level 4 operations. [Nvidia is also partnering with automakers Audi and Mercedes-Benz.]\"This is the kind of strategic tie-up that lets both partners do what they do best \u2013 Nvidia can focus on developing the core AI supercomputing tech, and Bosch can provide relationships and sales operations that offer true scale and reach,\" says Darrell Etherington for TechCrunch.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Argo AI, a Pittsburgh startup, has sold a majority share of their company to Ford Motor Co. which has agreed to invest $1 billion over a five year schedule but will immediately become the majority shareholder. Both companies declined to disclose further details.Argo AI plans to fully support Ford but eventually license its software and sensor suite to other companies. This unusual arrangement is part of the deal agreement where Argo AI will become a subsidiary of Ford, and Ford will be the majority shareholder of Argo AI, but the company will operate independently and have its own board of directors. Argo AI's status as a quasi independent company would let it attract employees with salaries comparable to hot startups, as well as offer stock options. \"Let's face it, there's a war for talent these days. Argo [being able] to offer equity participation, we think it's pretty unique.\"\u201cOur view [is that], in the future, there will be a number of players that will have systems,\u201d Ford CEO Mark Fields told Recode in an interview. \u201cThere won\u2019t be just one winner. But at the same time we can offer that to other companies where it doesn\u2019t compromise our competitive advantages. We think that\u2019s a great opportunity to get even more scale and create some value for the companies.\u201dBryan Salesky, previously with Google\u2019s self-driving team and Peter Rander, previously with Uber\u2019s, will head up the new company. Argo AI plans to develop a software platform backbone for Ford\u2019s fully autonomous vehicle and are planning on making that platform a working reality by 2021. They are working with the City of Pittsburgh to find and establish a work facility, and planning to find office space in the Pittsburgh area and hiring up to 200 engineers and CS professionals. \u201cWe want to take a straight-line path to market as much as we possibly can,\u201d Salesky said.Until this transaction, Ford\u2019s investments in future transportation technology have been relatively modest, eg, $75 million to buy a minority stake in Velodyne, a manufacturer of laser-based LiDAR sensing systems, and $6.6 million in Civil Maps, a Berkeley, CA startup working on AI-powered mapping for self-driving cars.\"The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago,\" Ford President and CEO Mark Fields said in a statement. \"As Ford expands to be an auto and a mobility company, we believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future.\"\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Deciding what NOT to do is as important as deciding what TO do",
      "content": "Business maturity is what startups often need when they ask for an 'adult' to come and manage their company. That was certainly the case with Danish startup Universal Robots as they sought funds and a new CEO in 2008.Esben \u00d8stergaard (pictured), Kasper St\u00f8y and Kristian Kassow, two young PhD's and a civil engineer, all from the University of Southern Denmark (USD) located in Odense, came together in 2005 to make flexible robots. Kassow had a vision of running a robot manufacturing business, St\u00f8y and \u00d8stergaard, were to focus on the software, engineering and other practicalities. \u00d8stergaard also had a vision: he wanted to make robot technology accessible to all by developing small, user-friendly, reasonably priced, flexible industrial robots that were safe to work with and easy to program. Kassow created a business plan and secured their initial seed/startup round of funding from Syddansk Innovation, a state-funded investor and incubator for Danish technology startups. They named their new company Universal Robots A/S (UR).The startup was located at the USD where Kassow and \u00d8stergaard worked and St\u00f8y taught. They planned to spend 2005 and 2006 developing and building prototypes which would then be used to demonstrate their proof of concept and help secure a scale-up funding round. After a while St\u00f8y opted to teach full time rather than continue to work on the project and, because construction materials were more costly than planned, and the development phase was taking longer than expected, the two remaining founders took on some paid research to sustain their efforts. Making their robot easy to program was a major focus and they developed an intuitive touch screen and graphical user interface which made it surprisingly simple for users to program. Safety was the other major concern and they enlisted the Danish Technological Institute (DTI) to test their new robot. DTI confirmed that it would function in a safe manner without needing to be caged in; thus enabling an important sales feature for the new robot. But their robot remained unfinished as they worked on accomodating all the uses it could be put to.In 2008 they installed and customized their first robot on the packaging line of a nearby nursery... and then ran out of money and into serious debt.A representative of the Danish Growth Fund observed their situation as he met with the two. Nevertheless he became convinced of the viability of the robot as a product, and urged his board to fund  the startup -- but also to help find an adult to take over and bring some concise direction to the company.Krog Iversen worked for many years with Denmark's largest company, Moeller/Maersk in Copenhagen and the U.S., secured an MBA from USD, and was a partner and Sales Director at Krog Iversen, the largest manufacturer of heating stoves in Denmark, a business he and his family sold in 2006. He was 10+ years senior in age to the two partners in UR in 2008 when, with funding from The Danish Growth Fund, Krog Iversen, and his family, he joined the company as CEO.Shortly thereafter he ran up against Kassow's business plan: to help UR customers customize their robots for their particular applications and to create a secondary profit center similar to the Apple App Store for the necessary accessories (grippers, covers, cameras, sensors, stands, etc.) and to provide comprehensive service and repair. Krog Iversen, on the other hand, believed in letting distributors do the hands-on work with the end users and having the company concentrate on the fewest number of products with the fewest, if any, options. Further, he thought it important that UR focus on making their robot arms without grippers or accessories; a formula which made for efficient manufacturing and required a network of integrator-type distributors. Under Krog Iversen's insistence, the partners reluctantly reworked their business plan to reflect those changes, to finalize their first six-axis robot, the UR5, to work on a UR10, and to develop a network of distributor integrators which would market directly to customers. This revised plan by Krog Iversen was a key transition point for UR: to decide to NOT be involved in how their robots would be configured to meet end-user needs and instead focus on the efficient manufacture of only two or three robots which shared components, design and software. This focus on manufacturing efficiencies and product testing carried forward as unit sales increased from hundreds to thousands per year to their present run-rate of approximately 1,500 robots per month!Krog Iversen cultivated the distributor-integrator scheme while encouraging Kassow to transform the company into an efficient manufacturing operation. 52 robots were sold and produced in 2009 and the distributor network was taking hold and promised a much bigger 2010. But Kassow became disgruntled with the direction of the company and the discipline that Krog Iversen brought to company operations. Kassow chose to leave at about the same time as the global financial crisis of 2008 was having its effect on UR: although there was excitement about the product, there was resistance to spending money until the economy stabilized. To carry the company through the slowdown, Krog Iversen and the Danish Growth Fund injected an additional $1.5 million of equity funding which was sufficient to weather the storm and carry them through 2010. Late in 2010, after only three rounds of funding, UR became profitable and was self-funded thereafter.Krog Iversen conceived marketing the UR robots as collaborative robots with two primary audiences: end users and distributor/integrators. He understood the need to educate the end user and sell distributors and integrators on the concept that UR co-bots weren't a technology play but rather one that reduced production costs, had a very short return on investment (ROI), augmented workers, and offered a high profit margin on the robots and accessories involved in a typical sale.Krog Iversen sought out a dynamic marketing manager and ambitious PR partners to help convey both of UR's target audiences. He hired Thomas Visti (pictured) to develop the international distributor network and Malene Grouleff and Mette McCall were contracted to spearhead publicity and PR in Europe and the U.S. respectively.Krog Iversen brought his discipline to their marketing and PR decisions as well. He encouraged the production and promotion of video use cases that emphasized ROI, efficiency and ease of operation. Safety was implied but ROI, ease of use and productivity were the key selling points. Videos were made and distributed that showed how easy it was to set up and program the robot. And he encouraged an open-door quick-response policy for all types of media while promising to always be available to the media.Said McCall of some of her experiences on behalf of UR:My agency helped spread the word of the distributors\u2019 excitement taking on this new line of UR robots and by the Spring of 2013, we were able to produce our first U.S. case study. Traveling around North America telling the stories of the many varied and surprising ways UR robots are being deployed has been the most fun, creative and rewarding assignment. This is where journalism and the \u201cgood story\u201d concept is leveraged. The robots lend themselves so well to video storytelling; when a line operator laughingly tells you that they named their new UR robots \u201cThelma\" and \"Louise\u201d because they thought they were going to drive them over a cliff and they would all lose their jobs (which they didn\u2019t, they got better jobs after the robot took over their ergonomically unfavorable tasks), or when the first automation engineers started to wheel the robots around between tasks - something unthinkable with traditional industrial robots that stay bolted down in a cage.Enrico always encouraged us to position UR through these case studies and he was always the first to grab a robot arm and give a demo. We had fun doing a press tour in New York taking a UR5 in two cardboard boxes, wheeling it on a hand truck in and out of Manhattan offices presenting the robot directly to the editors \u2013 that was the first time they ever had a live demo of an industrial robot right at their desk!UR's two PR firms weren't the only groups promoting collaborative robotics. In Europe the SMErobotics Project, funded by the EU, produced some widely viewed videos about how small and medium-sized enterprises (SME's) could benefit from the use of low-cost flexible robots so long as they were safe and easy to program. The SMErobotics Project promoted that it was time to incorporate \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cintuitive\u201d technologies into the robot programming process. The big pitch was that the robot must be plug and play AND easy to program AND safe -- the very features that UR was promoting. The concept was that if you empowered shop employees with robotic tools that improved their combined productivity, the SME would become more cost efficient and competitive and therefore not have to move offshore.In the U.S., Rodney Brooks, an eloquent MIT professor and co-founder of iRobot, was on the road promoting his new startup, Rethink Robotics and their two-armed collaborative robot Baxter. He spoke at every event, everywhere, and described an SME marketplace ripe for collaborative robotics such as his Baxter (and UR's UR robots). He made similar points as the European SME movement but described how, through the use of co-bots such as Baxter, SME workers could become more productive, happier with their jobs, and their increased productivity more cost efficient for their company.The global SME marketplace is huge \u2013 6 million companies worldwide and almost 70% of the world\u2019s manufacturing. A few low-cost plug and play robotic tools -- like the robots sold by Rethink and UR -- could easily fit into the manufacturing process of most of these companies which is why most business executives became excited at the prospect of testing them out in their shops and factories. But the Baxter robot didn't live up to those expectations at the time whereas the UR robots did. Brooks' marketing inadvertently helped UR more than it did his own company. Thus UR sales grew throughout Europe and the U.S. From the initial business plan developed by Krog Iversen in 2008, an exit strategy was included that called for raising market value ten times and growing revenue by at least 60% to 70% each year. When those criteria were reached, then it would be time to consider offers from companies that would benefit from combining URs activities with theirs. As that time became evident, Krog Iversen found that his time was being taken up reviewing and responding to too many offers. Enrico didn't want to go public nor did he want to sell to a private equity fund. Instead, he and the board set up an Exit Committee and hired a UK investment bank to spread the word, handle the offers and cull out and recommend the very best strategic offers. Teradyne was their primary recommendation.Teradyne had purchased some UR robots and had firsthand knowledge of their value within their factories. And they were willing to pay what Krog Iversen thought as a fair price. A deal was consummated in May of 2015 for $285 million in cash and an additional $65 million if certain performance targets were met through 2018 thereby bringing the overall sales price to $350 million. From Teradyne's point of view, this was a win-win transaction: Teradyne becomes a player in the collaborative robotics space and the inventors and entrepreneurs of Universal got a serious strategic partner, one that could help them with marketing, manufacturing, management and engineering. In Krog Iversen's case, the deal offered the ability to move on to his next big thing. In March, 2016, UR and Teradyne announced that J\u00fcrgen von Hollen would become the new CEO while Krog Iversen was beginning his new career as investor.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Parrot struggling, Lily fails and Google closes Titan Project as drone industry disunites",
      "content": "Entertainment, camera, moon-shot and military drones are all becomming more distinct as the drone industry gets commoditized. Prices are dropping even as impressive new features are added. It's a difficult time for drone makers.UPDATED 1/13/2017: SF District Attorney files false advertising suit against Lily Robotics. Details added below.UPDATED 1/17/2017: CyPhy Works LVL 1 drone was successfully crowdfunded and then one year later refunded. Details added below.The commercial drones market consists of consumer products like toys, games and camera drones for photography and action selfies, and the professional market (called the pro-sumer market) which serves the construction, surveying, mapping, utilities, telecom, ag, public safety and insurance industries where the drone is matched with speciality software to provide package solutions unique to those industry groups. Many feel that a saturation point has been reached in the consumer marketplace and that after reaching that point it then becomes a race to the bottom in terms of price and profitability, hence the shift to the pro-sumer market by almost all drone makers.Parrot SA is a French wireless products manufacturer based in Paris, France. Parrot invented and manufactured the AR.Drone and initiated a drone division which now represents 1/3 of their business. Parrot just released its Q4 2016 report which showed a 15% drop in revenue. The company had revenues of \u20ac85 million but targeted \u20ac100 million. Revenue from drones was \u20ac60 million, with \u20ac11 million coming from commercial, and \u20ac49 million from consumer drones. As a result, Parrot announced plans to reduce its drone workforce by 35%, laying off around 290 people.Parrot plans to focus on a reduced number of consumer products, redeploy product offerings, realign resources and adjust its support teams. Conversely, Parrot will continue to invest in its commercial drone business which has been doing well and is steadily growing.3D Robotics and their Solo quadcopter were media hits until their product stumbled and their ambitious inventories didn't move. Like Parrot, 3DR laid off hundreds last year, had to shut down facilities, and has since been scrambling to keep afloat by refocusing on commercial operations in the pro-sumer marketplace.Lily, a Silicon Valley startup with a stylish camera drone and presentation, announced that although it had $34 million in pre-sales, it couldn't get additional funds to meet production demands and was closing down. What remains of the company is focused on handling refunds.\"After so much hard work, we are sad to see this adventure come to an end,\" founders Balaresque and Bradlow wrote on the Lily website. \"We are very sorry and disappointed that we will not be able to deliver your flying camera, and are incredibly grateful for your support as a pre-order customer.\"In a late development which portends difficulty for other over-exuberant marketing types, the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office filed suit against Lily Robotics over claims that the drone maker engaged in false advertising and unfair business practices. Lily said it would begin shipping drones to customers who had placed orders by February 2016, but failed to live up to that promise. The office alleged that Lily lured customers with a promotional video that was actually filmed by a \u201cmuch more expensive, professional camera drone that required two people to operate.\u201d \u201cIt does not matter if a company is established or if it is a startup,\u201d District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. \u201cEveryone in the market must follow the rules. By protecting consumers, we protect confidence in our system of commerce.\u201dIn May, 2015, CyPhy Works successfully crowdfunded $882,000 for their LVL 1 drone, a 6-bladed self-leveling device which was to sell at $495 and begin deliveries in February, 2016. In April, 2016 they cancelled the project and refunded all the Kickstarter funding claiming that delays in a key processor chip wouldn't be available until mid-2017 consequently they didn't want to delay the project until then and would instead refund all Kickstarter funders and pre-orders. Alphabet (Google) has closed down the Titan Project to fly high-altitude drones that would beam wireless Internet access back down to the earth. More than 50 project members were let go - some have moved to other Google X projects. Titan Aerospace was acquired by Google in 2014 and was reformed into the Titan Project which competed with another Google X project, Project Loon, which also has problems. Loon is temporarily mired in an IP infringement suit with Space Data.Although GoPro had a big presence at CES, their Karma drone wasn't there and the sales people said that they hope it will be re-released in a few months. Karma was high-profile, long-anticipated, and late. The Karma was supposed to be the company's hope to pull up diminishing revenues. Karma had mid-flight power failures and GoPro recalled all the devices shipped and offered refunds. GoPro cut its staff by about 200 people in November. Karma's relaunch, if it happens, will need to compensate for product and price improvements offered by DJI that outperform and underprice the Karma in all but camera lenses.DJI is the elephant in the room. Their products have outperformed, outpriced and been faster to market than all their competitors. Their marketing has emphasized integration with pro-sumer software, GoPro cameras and mounts, and other accessories. They keep on inventing and they are headquartered in Shenzhen where all their suppliers reside, hence their ability to be quick to market.\u201cWhat we realized is that it\u2019s inherently much more difficult for a Silicon Valley-based, software-focused company to compete against a vertically integrated powerhouse manufacturing company in China,\u201d said Colin Guinn, 3D Robotics' former chief revenue officer.Founded in 2006 as a company that built flight controllers for remote control toy helicopters, DJI unveiled the Phantom in 2012, an off-the-shelf drone that became the standard for consumer drones.DJI seems to have a rhythm to their products: launch, then 6-10 months later lower prices, then launch a newer upgraded product at a price point halfway between the previous product and the discounted price, then repeat the process. Even DJI has recently begun to feel the heat from fellow Chinese drone makers Xiaomi and Yuneec both of which undercut DJI with similar products at lower prices. Hence DJI's stressing their collaboration with and integration of software and accessory vendors focusing on the pro-sumer marketplace.In the defense sector the Predator, Reaper, and Global Hawk drones that have done their work in two wars have become popularized by movies that exposed their expense, their vulnerabilities, and their Las Vegas-based human pilots and sensor operators controlling them remotely. Now DARPA and the DoD are introducing new robot war machines. Their latest is drone swarms, where several small flying robots work together to do jobs previously done by the larger craft. An anti-air missile can shoot down an $18 million Reaper, but firing that same anti-air missile at a swarm of drones wouldn't work.With every Predator, there\u2019s a joystick and flight controls for a human pilot who maneuvers it. That format changes entirely with a group of autonomous swarming drones.\u201cThey are a collective organism, sharing one distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to each other like swarms in nature,\u201d according to Strategic Capabilities Office Director William Roper. Unlike the Predator, where the machine responds to the pilot\u2019s joystick, this swarm receives objectives from a human controller, and then directs itself to that location. Presumably, the swarm could still fly to a preset list of objectives even if it loses contact with a human controller, giving it the freedom to operate in the face of jamming as well as anti-air weapons.[Recently an Australian startup, DroneShield Detection, has developed a set of sensors and a StarWars-looking gun that can detect and shoot a swarm out of the sky.]Drones to protect and defend are a necessary part of government's province and a steady source of research, invention, and income for the military industrial complex. In the next four years, at least in the U.S., the defense/security segment of the drone industry is expecting significant growth.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

Also added Cafe X Technologies, Fellow Robots and Simbe Robotics to the list of companies receiving an undisclosed amount.Velodyne LiDAR got the most money in 2016, $150 million, with Zymergen and UBTech also getting over $100 million each.In monthly recaps by The Robot Report, fundings grew until they peaked in August and then dipped in December. August was the month when Velodyne got their $150 million and Quanergy got $90 million. The next highest in August was $35 million for FormLabs.The colorful chart on the left recaps the number of companies receiving funding by application area. 25 unmanned aerial systems companies got the biggest number of fundings followed by 15 agricultural robotics startups, service robotics for businesses, service robots for personal use, vision systems providers, self-driving systems and mobile robotics and AGVs companies, plus a whole bunch of smaller categories. Investments in robotic solutions for the ag industry were noted by Rob Leclerc of AgFunder who said:\u201cThe number of deals grew 7% year-over-year, as we recorded 307 deals this half compared to 286 during the first half of 2015.

No companies went public.\u201cOur origins are in robotics, our future is as an apparel company,\u201d said Rich Mahoney, co-founder and CEO of Superflex, who previously served as the Director of Robotics at SRI International. \u201cWe\u2019ll combine comfort and style with power assist for clothes that look good and help people feel good.

We believe this is a great product for the agriculture sector that can drive increased yields and reduced costs for growers.\u201dOnly four robotics-related companies went public in 2016; none occured in December.According to Erin Griffith of Fortune's Term Sheet, the biggest trend in late stage venture funding in 2016 was the retreat of hedge funds and mutual funds. Instead, 2016 was the year of the \"non-tech incumbents,\" doing big tech startup acquisitions. (Think Intelligrated-Honeywell, GM-Cruise, Midea-KUKA). It was the year of corporate makeovers, a drive to find new avenues in the face of anemic growth.

      "content": "At RoboUniverse in San Diego in December, agricultural robots and the labor shortage were quickly identified as the biggest issues facing the industry today. Water scarcity and field health were other key issues mentioned, but it\u2019s labor that keeps farmers up at night and robotics that could come to their rescue.Labor availability and lack of fully effective automation have pushed some farming businesses to give up growing certain crops.\u201cWe purposefully moved away from crops that require a lot of labor,\u201d said Stuart Woolf, president and CEO of Woolf Farming & Processing, a Central Valley family farming group. \u201cWe now focus on tomatoes, almonds and other crops that can be mechanically harvested.\u201dHowever, pushing up the price of his fruit to pay for the increased labor costs is not a long-term solution, as Woolf said:\u201cI don\u2019t want my commodity to become a luxury item that only a few can afford to eat. The labor issue will not get better, and we\u2019re at a tipping point now, so we need to combine technology and labor to enable us to stay competitive; we can\u2019t keep raising prices, it won\u2019t work in the marketplace.\u201dAnother California fruit farmer, Harold McClarty, president of HMC Farms, said:\u201cWe won\u2019t find a technology that picks fruit the way we do. I have yet to find a robot with an effective, dexterous arm. Instead we are developing certain things that we can use in the packing houses. There are lots of modifications that can be made in the packing houses; they\u2019re a much better and easier place to innovate.\u201dAt RoboUniverse, in a track entitled The Intersection of Technology and Applications in Agriculture coordinated by ag tech startup Food Origins CEO Nathan Dorn, participants were presented with robotics-related technological opportunities from computer vision to AI and from soft and hard gripping to intelligent path planning. There was also a panel where farm managers described their needs and impatience waiting for technology to effectively perform.[Food Origins is developing sensing technology and analytics that allows it to gather and parse data in new and disruptive ways tracking value from harvest to table, allowing transparency and traceability.]Dino Giacomazzi of Giacomazzi Dairy Farms said, \u201cOur workforce is either 25 years old or 65 years old. There is no in between right now and that is a problem. The 25-year-old farm hands either don\u2019t like the work or find better work and are gone after payday. I have living animals who need the engagement from good people or good machines.\u201d In June, The Green Economy quoted Kip Tom, a 7th generation Indiana farmer who heads Tom Farms, an enterprise that encompasses 20,000 acres of corn and soybean across 7 Indiana counties and is also one of Monsanto\u2019s largest seed producers, who said:\u201cFarmers that don\u2019t learn about these new ag technologies will get left behind. Whether it's information and technology, or equipment technology, there are technologies that will help our industry deliver a sustainable, affordable, and nutritious supply of food to global consumers. It\u2019s exciting, but what is most exciting is when we see collaboration between people in the field, who understand what we need, and developers in places like Silicon Valley and the investment community saying this is something new that we haven\u2019t paid much attention to.\u201dBrian Antle, of Tanimura & Antle (T&A), built a 600-unit housing facility in Spreckels, California, to house temporary agricultural workers with H2A visas. T&A has also invested in many ag tech startups. Antle said that it was no longer an option to sit on the sidelines and wait for machinery builders to deliver solutions. \u201cWe are all losing opportunities to sell quality products because the lettuce is picked late or we are too short staffed to meet our goals. If we cannot get more people, we must find machines.\u201dData generated by sensors or drones and collected by farms on the field or during field operations, offer a wealth of information about soil, seeds, livestock, crops, costs, farm equipment and the use of water and fertilizer. Low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and advanced analytics are already beginning to help farmers analyze data like weather, temperature, moisture, prices, and communication signals, and provide insights on how to optimize and increase yield, improve farm planning, make smarter decisions about the level of resources needed, and determine when and where to distribute those resources in order to prevent waste and increase yield.Efficiency and productivity will increase in the next few years as precision agricultural methods become more prevalent and farms become smarter and more connected, but this could just be the precursor to even greater use of robotic technology in farming.BusinessInsider Intelligence predicts that IoT device installations in the agriculture world will increase from 30 million units in 2015 to 75 million in 2020, for a compound annual growth rate of 20%.OnFarm, a startup that makes an IoT platform, ran studies and determined that for the average farm, yield rose by 1.75%, energy costs dropped $7 to $13 per acre, and water use for irrigation fell by 8% when IoT devices streamed their data to software that analyzed all the input sources and output meaningful farm management prescriptions.A new report by Tractica, a Colorado research firm, forecasts that shipments of agricultural robots will increase significantly in the years ahead, rising from 32,000 units in 2016 to 594,000 units annually in 2024, by which time the market is expected to reach $74.1 billion in annual revenue.Robotics companies are keenly focused on the agricultural market opportunity. The Tractica report examined 178 industry participants - a particularly large number - who are developing and launching robotic systems to address the need for more automation to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and address labor concerns in the agriculture market. Tractica\u2019s report, \u201cAgricultural Robots\u201d, developed in collaboration with The Robot Report, examines global market trends for agricultural robots and provides 10-year market sizing and forecasts for agricultural robot shipments and revenue during the period from 2015 through 2024.  The report examines the market opportunities, barriers, and technology issues for each of the key application markets.  Market forecasts are segmented by world region and application type.  The study also includes 178 profiles of industry players in the agricultural robot market.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Beijing World Robot Conference drew big crowds and notable speakers",
      "content": "The Beijing World Robot Conference (WRC), sponsored by Beijing City, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the China Association of Science and Technology, was held October 21-25. It was big, long, ran over a weekend, and gave a run-down of the breath of China's fast-emerging robotics industry.More than 145 vendors filled the exhibition hall which was separated into international and domestic industrial robots, and service and special purpose robots. In the main forum, 45 sessions comprising individual and panel presentations took place in the main auditorium with seating for 1,000 over three of the five days of the event. Rodney Brooks described how collaborative robots are helping bring flexibility to electronics manufacturing; KUKA's Bernd Liepert described how manufacturing benefits through the use of robotics; and IBM's Grady Booch and many others discussed the future of AI in relation to robots, manufacturing, self-driving cars and cloud processing and connectedness; to name just a few of the Western speakers. The audience consisted of business executives, government personalities, academics of all types and from all across China, Korea, Japan and the EU, robot manufacturers and their sales staffs, and, particularly on the weekend, whole families - from children to their great grandparents.A variety of contests and challenges focused on young people peppered the event: an unmanned driving challenge, an underwater robot competition, a RoboCup Challenge of robots playing soccer, and a youth challenge to work with other kids to get a robot to shoot hoops. There was even Star Challenge, a reality show about robotic startups and their key people, that will soon be broadcast on Chinese satellite and network TV.Most of the WRC reviews that appeared in Chinese and international media emphasized the abundance of human-like robots such as JiaJia, a super realistic robot capable of micro facial expressions and basic conversation, from the University of Science and Technology of China. She was the media hit as can be seen in this video which shows JiaJia, an old man in traditional Chinese clothing drawing Chinese characters with a brush, and a few other mobile robots.Other media showed a man flying a bionic butterfly drone, a badminton-playing robot that took on the crowd, and SmartTuna, a swimming industrial robot that finds leaks inside underwater pipelines which swam through clear plastic pipes for all to see.Business executives from companies that were users or candidates to use robots in their businesses were exposed to a wide range of applications and uses throughout the conference and by demonstrations on the exhibition floor. The conference program was forward-looking and addressed subjects such as Russian and Israeli co-operative partnerships, healthcare and surgical developments, collaborative robots, self-driving vehicles, drones, and research challenges that must be met for the industry to progress and succeed.About 40% of the robots on display at the show were industrial, while the rest were service and specialized robots.According to the China Robot Industry Association, 68,000 industrial robots were sold in China in 2015, up 20% compared to the same period of 2014. China accounted for about a quarter of robot sales globally in 2015, making the country the biggest market for industrial robots for three consecutive years. 32,996 industrial robots were manufactured in China last year, up 21.7% year on year.China has set goals to be able to make in-country 150,000 industrial robots in 2020, 260,000 in 2025 and 400,000 by 2030 and Shenzhen-based Siasun Robot & Automation, China's largest domestic robot manufacturer, had the largest exhibition space to show their full range of robotic products.In April, the Ministry of Industry, the Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance and other ministries jointly issued a development plan for the next 5 years which included these goals and stressed the need for service robots as well as industrial ones, hence the emphasis at the show and in the conference program of the growing importance of non-industrial robots as consumer and entertainment products, social assistants and helpers and for all manner of use in business.The Chinese government is determined to stimulate robot development in China. According to statistics released by the Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, China\u2019s domestic robot industry in 2015 was just $243 million, albeit a year-over-year increase of 55%.At the conference, Vice Premier Liu Yandong urged enhanced research and development of the industry. She said related policies should be improved, human resources should be developed, and global communication should be enhanced.According to Ms. Yandong, the development of robotics technology plays an important role in supporting intelligent manufacturing, enhancing production efficiency and improving the people\u2019s well-being, which ushers in a new era of economic and social development. She also said:The Chinese Government attaches great importance to robotics technology innovation and industrial development, and expects to speed up the development of intelligent industries represented by robotics and strengthen cultivation of innovation talents, improve synergized education mechanism and incentive evaluation mechanism integrating industries, universities, research institutes and users, and help innovation talents give full scope to their expertise; advance international exchange and cooperation, jointly develop international standards for robotics, intensify application for patents and protection of intellectual property rights, and strive to establish a robotics development pattern of inclusive development, resource sharing and complementary advantage.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Self-driving cars, networks, and the companies and people that are stimulating development",
      "content": "Intel is establishing an autonomous driving division; hacker George Hotz is open-sourcing his self-driving software in a bid to become a network company; LiDAR and distancing devices are changing. What's it all mean?Semiconductor giant Intel, in a strategic move to become THE supplier of chips to the fast-emerging self-driving industry, is reorganizing and creating a new division. Fortune magazine said:The decision is a bet not just on a future of connected devices; it\u2019s also a wager that vehicles will be the centerpiece or at least a core component in the world of IoT. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has predicted that by 2020, the Internet of Things will include 50 billion devices and each user of those gadgets will generate 1.5 gigabytes of data every day. But, he has said, the average autonomous car will create about 40 gigabytes of data each minute.That\u2019s a lot of data to process and who better to handle the load? Intel.Intel in recent months has made key acquisitions and strategic partnerships in pursuit of their autonomous driving division's plans:A partnership with German automaker BMW and Israeli Mobileye to produce self-driving cars for city streets. The companies plan to develop the technology as an open platform that can be used by other automakers or ride-sharing companies.Delphi and Mobileye announced they will use Intel's \u201csystem on chip\u201d for autonomous vehicle systems.Intel acquired three companies with related products and plans for self-driving cars:Yogitech is a semiconductor design firm that specializes in adding safety functions to chips used in self-driving cars and other autonomous devicesArynga, which was acquired by Intel's Wind River Unit, develops software that enables vehicles to received over-the-air updates\u2014a capability used frequently by automaker Tesla to enhance performance and fix security bugs in its carsItseez, a company that specializes in machine vision technology that lets computers see and understand their surroundings - a necessityfor autonomous vehicles which need to be able to perceive the world around it.In a move toward becoming a network provider, and in response to a recent NHTSA letter which caused Hotz to cancel his self-driving aftermarket kit, Hotz announced his plans to open his software code and hardware designs to the world. On November 30th all of the code and plans were posted on Github. Hotz is encouraging people to build their own self-driving kits. His software enables adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist for certain Honda and Acura models. Fortune magazine quoted Hotz as saying:NuTonomy, an MIT spin-off and autonomous vehicle systems startup that\u2019s been testing its technology in Singapore, announced it will begin testing its self-driving Renault Zoe electric vehicles in an industrial park in South Boston in the next few weeks. Although the area is a public area, NuTonomy will, because of the nature of the industrial park, still be somewhat removed from normal vehicle and pedestrian traffic.Oryx Vision, an Israeli startup which recently got $17 million in a Series A funding round, shows off its new coherent optical radar which uses a laser to illuminate the road ahead, but radar to treat reflected signals as a wave rather than a particle. In an article in IEEE Spectrum, it was revealed that:The laser in question is a long-wave infrared laser, also called a terahertz laser because of the frequency at which it operates. Because human eyes cannot focus light at this frequency, Oryx can use higher power levels than can lidar designers. Long-wave infrared light is also poorly absorbed by water and represents only a tiny fraction of the solar radiation that reaches Earth. This means the system should not be blinded by fog or direct sunlight, as lidar systems and cameras can be.One of the potential cost savings of Oryx\u2019s technology comes from the fact that its laser does not need to be steered with mechanical mirrors or a phased array in order to capture a scene. Simple optics spread the laser beam to illuminate a wide swathe in front of the vehicle. (Oryx would not say what the system\u2019s field of view will be, but if it is not 360 degrees like rooftop lidars, a car will need multiple Oryx units facing in different directions.)The clever bit\u2014and what has prevented anyone from building a terahertz lidar before now\u2014is what happens when the light bounces back to the sensor. A second set of optics direct the incoming light onto a large number of microscopic rectifying nanoantennas. These are what Oryx\u2019s co-founder, David Ben-Bassat, has spent the past six years developing.\u201cToday, radars can see to 150- or 200 meters, but they don\u2019t have enough resolution. Lidar provides great resolution but is limited in range to about 60 meters, and to as little as 30 meters in direct sunlight,\u201d says Wellingstein. He expects Oryx\u2019s coherent optical radar to accurately locate debris in the road at 60 meters, pedestrians at 100 meters, and motorcycles at 150 meters\u2014significantly better than the performance of today\u2019s sensor systems.Regarding other industry improvements and inventions, the IEEE Spectrum article also said:But don\u2019t write off lidar just yet. Following a $150 million investment by Ford and Chinese search giant Baidu this summer, Velodyne expects an \u201cexponential increase in lidar sensor deployments.\u201d The cost of the technology is still dropping, with Velodyne estimating that one of its newer small-form lidars will cost just $500 when made at scale [at present, the price on the website is $7,999 for the new PUCK shown on the right].Solid-state lidars are also on the horizon, with manufacturers including Quanergy, Innoluce, and another Israeli start-up, Innoviz, hinting at sub-$100 devices. Osram recently said that it could have a solid-state automotive lidar on the market as soon as 2018, with an eventual target price of under $50. Its credit card\u2013size lidar may be able to detect pedestrians at distances up to 70 meters.That\u2019s not quite as good as Oryx promises, but is probably fine for all but the very fastest highway driving. The window for disrupting lidar\u2019s grip on autonomous vehicles is closing fast.Fast-emerging may be a catch-all phrase but it seems appropriate to the various parts of the self-driving vehicle marketplace. There are multiple stakeholders about to be disrupted as I wrote about in April:The stakeholders are numerous and the effects can be devastating. Think secretaries, airline reservationists, and all the others disrupted during the emergence of the digital era. The transition to self-driving vehicles and car-sharing systems is likely to cause similar worldwide disruptions. Consider the insurance industry. If accident rates go down by 90%, as many are predicting, premiums will need to go down too because the reserves for payouts, which are built into the rates, will go down as well. Also there will likely be fewer insured drivers and car owners thereby lowering the pool of insured people.Consider hotels and motels and their real estate values and employees - particularly those along the major highways. Why stop at a motel when you can snooze comfortably in a long-haul high-speed driverless car? This will likely effect short-haul airlines and airline employees as well.Think about professional drivers - truckers, taxies, limos, buses, shuttles. It is expected that many will be replaced by on-demand point-to-point self-driving devices. The list of stakeholders also goes on in the auto manufacturing industry and all the Tier 1, 2, 3 and 4 component providers and wannabees. As self-driving vehicles show their needs - for example, the need for low-cost distancing vision systems - new products will be developed and new vendors could replace old ones, hence the posturing by Velodyne, LeddarTech, Quanergy, Bosch, Valeo and all the other LiDAR providers. As the technologies emerge, it becomes clear that vehicles will be the core component in a larger connected world, streaming massive amounts of data to be analyzed in ways we haven't even fathomed yet, hence Intel's new division and the new chips from Nvidea, Qualcomm and others. It's a fast-emerging marketplace on multiple fronts.Times and our definition of cars are changing day by day - and fast emerging - a true moving target!\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "For the last many years there have been very few stock IPOs (Initial Public Offerings). Promising companies have been acquired instead, eg: Kiva Systems and Universal Robots. But two robotics-related companies have recently filed: one for the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the other for the New York Stock Exchange.Myomo, a Cambridge, MA medical device robotics startup, is using the new Reg-A crowdfunding method to seek funding for their new MYO stock to be listed on the NYSE MKT Exchange. The Reg-A rules, known as \"Regulation A+,\" were adopted by the SEC as part of the JOBS Act and became effective in June 2015. Regulation A+ is designed to allow early stage growth companies to raise up to $50 million in a crowdfunded-like public offering through a process that provides streamlined and lower-cost access to the capital markets for the issuer and provides investors the opportunity to participate in an IPO for these potentially high growth companies. Myomo has designed and developed a myoelectric upper limb orthosis that supports weak or deformed arms. Their device helps users regain the ability to perform ADLs (activities of daily living) using EMG signals to drive small motors that allow users to extend/flex elbows and open/close thumb and fingers.The IPO is expected to finalize in January 2017 and the proceeds will be used to fund Myomo's sales and marketing expansion, product development, repayment of debt and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.ZMP, a Tokyo-based service robotics provider of mobility products, has partnered with DeNa, a provider of a broad range of mobile and online services including games, e-commerce and entertainment content distribution, to develop a fleet of autonomous Level 5 robot taxis (and started a company by that name, Robot Taxi) in time for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. ZMP also partnered with Sony to develop the new AeroSense UAV startup.ZMP has filed for an IPO of approximately $82 million and plans to be traded on the TYO Mothers Market exchange under the symbol 7316.  It said that funds would be used for research and development to strengthen its self-driving technology as well as fund affiliate Robot Taxi. ZMP will begin trading Dec. 19 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\u2019s Mothers Market for startups.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Lofty goals crash land while B2B drones prosper",
      "content": "Key executives leaving (or were requested to leave) Goggle's drone delivery Project Wing; GoPro recalls all of its newly launched Karma drones and doesn't offer a replacement; DJI slashes prices. What's going on?Funding for drone makers has bottomed out although new applications using drones are still getting funded, e.g., home and business security drones. Consumer purchases are weak with DJI and Parrot's line of products capturing most of the market, and DJI's aggressive lowering of prices forcing startups and other makers to focus on specialized tasks. There's turmoil in the drone industry.GoPro Inc recalled about 2,500 drones - all of their shipments thus far - for a refund - after just a couple of weeks on the market. Units had sudden power outages. GoPro didn't say when or if it would offer a replacement product. GoPro's much-delayed Karma project is also threatened by competing and lower-priced camera drones from DJI and many others (see chart below).Part of DJI's strategy exhibited over the past few years is to offer newer and better products faster than the competition and reduce prices of previous versions in conjunction with the new launches. Their price slashing has enabled them to dominate the market. DJI discounted its popular Phantom 3 drone to about $300 today from $1,000 at the beginning of the year.3D Robotics - an early drone startup that raised more than $125 million, has seen its consumer business all but crash and had massive layoffs shortly after releasing its Solo consumer drone - a competing product to DJI's Phantom 3 - at a price ($1,500) higher than the Phantom 3. Co-founder and CEO Chris Anderson said:\"It's no fun watching prices fall by 70 percent in 9 months\"  [referring to DJI's price-cutting]. In a retrenching effort, 3DR unveiled a new commercial camera-equipped drone (the Solo) with imaging software designed for construction companies. 3DR's plan is to outfit the Solo with new technology to capture 3D images that show the shape, size and volume of items at a construction site.\"It might be too little too late for 3DR,\" said industry analyst Patrick Egan. \"They aren't the only company that is going to have problems.\"From a recent Wall Street Journal article:Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, has been developing delivery drones in its research arm since 2012 with the hopes of transforming logistics. But the drone project\u2014dubbed Project Wing\u2014has had a bumpy ride, with its original head departing in 2014.Alphabet last month pushed out the project\u2019s chief, Dave Vos, and its top commercial executive, Sean Mullaney, in large part because of conflict between the group\u2019s engineers and its commercial team, according to the people familiar with the matter. It also issued notices to several other Project Wing workers, giving them 90 days to find other positions within Alphabet, one former employee said.An Alphabet spokeswoman said the company is committed to Wing and the concept of delivery drones. Astro Teller, the new temporary head of Project Wing, has spoken recently about the potential for delivery drones to not only upend logistics, but also reinvent the concept of ownership by giving people access to some goods in minutes versus having to keep such items on hand for the rare moments they are needed. \u201cWe believe that opening the skies to faster, more efficient transportation of goods is a moonshot worth pursuing.\u201dLofty goals indeed for Google and Teller. But turning the corner from research, testing and product engineering to a functioning product that conforms to FAA and other governmental regulations and is secure from pranksters, children and thieves is another matter altogether and there's a ticking clock of competitors hoping to get to market first. Many, many companies, including Amazon, DHL, Walmart and UPS are aggressively developing drones and landing/delivery systems for same-day and/or speedy delivery.While many drone-makers overestimated demand from hobbyists and other consumers, they now see big opportunities selling to businesses. There is strong interest in software and services that can make aerial imaging useful for industries including insurance, construction, agriculture and entertainment. senseFly, a Parrot company and DelAir, the new owner of Gatewing (a drone and service provider to Trimble's global agricultural division, join startups and others (see chart below) that are focusing on software to make sense of images, whether it's the angle of a pipe laid at a new construction site or damage to a roof from a hurricane or collision-avoidance. The drone itself is just a tool in the overall objective.Parrot, whose stock has plummeted from $25 to $8 so far this year, predicted that 2016 would be a \"bloody year\" for drone makers. Parrot CEO Henri Seydoux, in an interview in Forbes in November, 2015, predicted 2016 would be a year of reckoning for the consumer drone space and that 2016 would be a \u2018bloody\u2019 12 months for any company designing and selling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for hobbyists. It\u2019s just the nature of the consumer electronics business, he said, noting that increased competition will see a commoditization of the flying robots and perhaps even the collapse of some of the weaker companies.\u201cThere are now a dozen companies doing these types of drones. It will put a lot of pressure on the market.\u201dDelivery drones will happen someday soon; drones in agriculture and construction are already happening; drones for governmental and defense/security purposes will continue to happen. What we are seeing today is a consolidation process: commercial makers are separating into consumer or business providers; although the Drone Industry Insights chart shown below is already outdated, the big makers, Parrot, DJI and Ehang are hanging in there with substantial sales. Not shown on the chart are all the defense contractors that produce drones for the military; these vendors have pretty much given up on finding niche commercial markets and are, instead, focusing on improving their products and systems.Certainly 2016 is living up to Seydoux's predictions. Even the recent spinoff by Trimble of its Gatewing division is indicative of the consolidation and refocusing of efforts toward providing meaningful services using drones rather than selling drones. They'll leave that - selling drones to hobbyists and consumers - to the few companies that are able to emerge from the dropping prices of the commoditization of this type of camera drone.The broad market will continue to grow in all three segments (consumer, commercial and military) as will the variety of end-to-end business models. Quoting Drone Industry Insights:\"There are plenty of niches waiting to be discovered and occupied. Hardware will become more capable allowing new applications. Advanced drone operation regulations will allow new use cases with a high grade of automation. The drone ecosystem is strongly technology driven and market growth will additionally be catalyzed by developments outside the drone market environment (e.g. mobile phone industry, etc.).\"\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "The delicate balance between brilliance, safety and arrogance",
      "content": "Silicon Valley and other technology centers have their share of brilliant minds. Some of them have similarly outstanding egos. A few of those have very short fuses. Such is the story of George Hotz.Hotz is certainly brilliant. He was the first person to unlock the iPhone and hack the PlayStation3. Recently his 2,000-line deep learning code, plus car hacks to capture the car's digital systems, and his driving model, has learned how and written code to drive a car. He demonstrated this to a Bloomberg reporter earlier this year after which he got some funding, hired a team of engineers and has turned that software into an inexpensive product - the green thing in his hand - which he promoted (and you can watch by clicking on the link) at TechCrunch Disrupt SF in September. The green device, the Comma One, is a $999 aftermarket add-on kit with a $24 monthly subscription fee for select Honda and Acura cars. The device replaces the rear-view mirror and captures the car's radar, steering, braking system and gas pedal. It also adds a camera.Hotz said that there were 750 of these devices at work in Beta test vehicles around the area, state and country.The TechCrunch video is in two parts: Hotz's 7-minute product presentation, and an in-depth Q&A with Darrell Etherington which is also informative and worth watching.Part of Hotz's talk was a review and critique of other companies making self-driving kits and self-driving cars. \"Shippability\" was his criteria and by that token, only Tesla has shipped and delivered a self-driving car. He was particularly hostile to the Cruise Automation people saying that they had sold out their original intention to build and sell an aftermarket kit. [For another spin on Cruise, see below.] The most politically correct thing I can say about that portion of his presentation was that his remarks were youthful.Enter the NHTSA (National Highway Transportation Safety Agency) with a strongly worded query and special order about the safety of Comma One. Recently, NHTSA has become aware that your company intends to sell a product, the \"comma one,\" that you claim allows certain Honda vehicles (and potentially certain Acura vehicles) to operate in a semi-autonomous mode. In a blog post dated October 20, 2016, you described your product as an \"advanced driver assist system,\" or \"in traditional auto manufacturer terms: as \"lane keeping assist\" and \"adaptive cruise control.\" You assert that the product \"should be legal.\"This \"aftermarket upgrade,\" as you describe it, is replacement motor vehicle equipment and your company is a manufacturer of motor vehicle equipment subject to the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Safety Act), 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301, under NHTSA's oversight. It is essential that you are aware of and in full compliance with your legal responsibilities to ensure vehicle safety before introducing this product into commerce.The NHTSA Special Order (SO) said that Comma.ai must respond under oath and accompanied by an affidavit, to 15 \"requests,\" or be fined up to $21,000 per day and/or become the subject of a civil action to compel responses. The SO asked Hotz to describe, in detail, how the Comma One is installed, what features it offers, how the driver can use the product, what conditions constitute safe operations of the device, what types of operator controls, roads, areas, speeds and environmental conditions such as weather or time of day may a car equipped with the Comma One operate safely and what testing procedures have been implemented to attest to those claims. Each of the questions require a detailed description of the basis to determine safe operation conditions. \u200bFinally, by replacing the rearview mirror, how will the Comma One block or obstruct the drivers ability to have sufficient rear view.[I don't know if the NHTSA's letter and SO are particularly harsh but certainly their concern for safety is evident as it should be; and as it should be for Hotz and the Comma.ai team. Governments and their regulations are an integral part of the process of bringing a new product like the Comma One to market. Certainly it was in their domain to request testing and safety methods from Comma. But Comma's response was definitely not predictable.]A day later Hotz Tweeted the bottom three messages you see on the right (read from bottom to top). Thus Hotz cancelled Comma's first official product even though an admirer says it was the best autonomous driving experience (top Tweet).Hotz said that Comma would turn its attention to \"other products and markets.\" It's unclear what those new products will be. But it is clear that this is a major change in direction at Comma, perhaps even the beginning of its demise.There's a saying that at some point every startup needs to bring in an adult to handle the difficult, distasteful, and often diplomaticl tasks that happen in business and with strong-willed inventors.Perhaps now would be a good time for Comma.ai to hire that adult (although it might be a little late).For those of you who thought the billion dollar acquisition of Cruise was a fluke, read on. One billion dollars! That\u2019s what GM paid earlier this year. $300 million in cash; $300 million in GM stock and the remainder in incentives to retain key employees.Up until news about the acquisition, Cruise was known as the developer of an aftermarket kit to turn select cars into self-driving cars. Actually Cruise had abandoned the kits almost a year earlier to build software instead. That's what attracted GM.A new article in Fortune by Erin Griffith sheds some insight and details into Cruise, its two founders, Kyle Vogt and Daniel Kan, and its importance to GM.Since the deal closed, Cruise has more than doubled its staff. The company\u2019s office is filling up quickly. Office space in San Francisco is already scarce and pricey, and Cruise has a unique challenge: It needs to drive cars in and out of the office. Beneath Cruise\u2019s barnlike warehouse is a fleet of Chevy Bolts, each outfitted with LiDAR laser sensors. There\u2019s only one ramp in and out of the basement. The cars are starting to feel crowded too.Cruise could solve its problem by moving its operations to the suburban sprawl of Silicon Valley proper. Like all the automakers, GM has an innovation outpost in Palo Alto. But no one at Cruise has even visited it. Staying independent is too important.Read the complete Fortune article here.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "The changing landscape of drone funding",
      "content": "CB Insights Drone Quarterly Financing Trends to VC-Backed Companies shows a downward trend. The Robot Report's monthly funding reports shows something different: a change in the nature of drone applications getting funded.According to CB Insights, there was $55 million invested in eight VC deals for the drone industry in the third quarter, compared with almost $106 million invested in 13 deals in the second quarter. In the third quarter of 2015, $134 million was invested in 12 drone-related companies, part of a banner year for drone startups.In The Robot Report's July, August and September monthly funding reports one can see a marked change in the type of drone-related company funding from previous months: all are applications-related and none are for the construction of drones. Many of those companies funded use DJI drones for their applications.As the drone industry gets over the fun of flying and separates into two distinct domains: (1) consumer-friendly flying cameras and (2) the business of providing data from overhead for a variety of business purposes, one can see the commoditization process happening: manufacturers of drones are consolidating and service providers are proliferating. This is what is showing up in the funding reports and also the news as companies that attempted to do it all rejigger themselves to become service providers and/or value-added resellers. 3D Robotics is an example of the latter.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Why DJI is succeeding in making and selling drones and 3DR didn\u2019t",
      "content": "It was clear that DJI was winning the drone war by the end of 2015. Today's best sellers are mostly DJI products. Other makers (Parrot, 3D Robotics, Autel, Yuneec et al) haven't been able to capture any significant portion of the camera drone market. Most saw the writing on the wall and began switching to becoming drone service providers in other marketplaces.Shenzhen-based DJI has thousands of employees and access to capital, talent and components. They are nearby to all their component suppliers. They have a domestic as well as international market. They move fast and have continued to improve and professionalize their products. They help their clients private label their drones. Their two biggest competitors, Yuneec and Parrot, have amassed less than 5% of the market - combined.DJI's latest product is the Mavic Pro, a novel compact and foldable drone that has every feature of earlier DJI drones with the addition of more advanced collision-avoiding computer vision. It is forecast that the Mavic Pro will be the hit of the 2016/2017 Holiday Season. According to Drone Flyers, a news portal focusing on the drone industry, it\u2019s likely that over 80% of the $300-$1,500 drone market will go DJI during the 2016 Christmas season.The GoPro Karma, long anticipated by GoPro fans worldwide, was introduced in September with shipments promised in time for Christmas. They've stopped accepting orders on their website and it's rumored that shipping has been pushed back to Spring 2017. Today's drone makers are fiercely competitive and all are re-jiggering their business plans to accomodate to DJI's dominance. With two new deep-pocketed competitors (GoPro and Xioami) entering the market - and all competing in the consumer camera drone marketplace - it's hard to see how a non-Chinese provider can succeed in that particular mass market. Niche markets, yes; camera drones, no.In this fast-changing market, the time lag between design, manufacturing, selling and feedback is one major reason. But another is the Shenzhen climate for electronics manufacturing... there's nowhere else like it; nowhere else that can move as quickly; has so much manufacturing talent; and no place where costs are the lowest because all the major component manufacturers are there.3D Robotics was a bit behind in coming to that conclusion. They had visions of becoming the great American hope with their Solo product but, with a combo punch of being late and buggy during a period when DJI launched two much better and cheaper products, Solo never took off and 3DR was stuck with a significant inventory of unsold product - another hazard of buying product from China.Early this year 3DR initiated a serious retrenching with a series of layoffs and office closures and is refocusing on becoming a professional drone service provider for the agriculture, surveying, construction, security, infrastructure and other verticals. Their staff has gone from 350 to less than 80. There is no information about what today's head count is. Last year, 3DR's cofounder Jordi Munoz left the company. He's now running a robotics startup in Chula Vista, CA, Mayan Robotics. Co-founder and CEO Chris Anderson said the company would continue shifting its focus towards the corporate market and attempted to raise $45 million but was only able to get $27 million earlier this year.See also: 3D Robotics undergoing layoffs and other challenges\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "SoftBank, the Japanese telecom conglomerate, led a group that included Iconiq Capital, Prelude Ventures, Tao Capital Partners, and seven others in a $130 million funding round for Zymergen to help the company grow its workforce and scale its operations in Silicon Valley.Zymergen is a startup with a focus on biology, analytics and robots. The company is attempting to produce industrial chemicals used in making products such as soap, ink and paint - a $3 trillion market according to Fortune Magazine. Zymergen creates the building blocks of these products from non-petroleum sources and creates new kinds of chemicals that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to develop. The creation of the microbes used by Zymergen are automated in what they call 'Robotics for high-throughput biology.' A recent Fortune article describes the process here.\"The company has a robot workforce to do things like stir liquid around in a petri dish while human scientists supervise thousands of robot-controlled trials in a given week. Zymergen then takes the data from these microbe experiments and uses a proprietary algorithm to sort through millions of different genetic combinations to guide the experiments and develop the best chemical.\"Zymergen attempts to precisely automate every step and can build and test thousands of strains enabling quicker and predictable breakthroughs. Their automated lab generates more data than manual lab work and they feel that this level of automation and analytics speeds up the data capture and improves operations and engineering.Our platform enables us to process and prioritize the enormous volume of data we collect to efficiently explore the near infinite design space for microbes. Prioritizing from among vast exploration possibilities [by decoding biology with machine learning] is the key to successfully engineering new strains. Our proprietary software lets us review large regions of the genome to pinpoint areas of interest which then guides additional tests with increased precision and reliability.Ginkgo Bioworks, a Boston startup attempting to do the same sort of thing, also received $100 million in funding in June. With those funds the company plans to obtain 600 million base pairs of manufactured DNA and from that develop not-pharmaceutical manufacturing processes in new areas such as commodity chemicals, industrial enzymes and human health markets.According to TechCrunch, Ginkgo currently makes products for the flavor, fragrance and food industries as well as works with DARPA to produce probiotics that will help U.S. soldiers stave off stomach bugs they might pick up overseas.Ginkgo will also be using some of the cash to finish building Bioworks2 - a rendering shown to the right. The new, 70,000 square-foot automated facility is being built to test prototypes of Ginkgo\u2019s designer DNA and create those new products.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Samsung acquires Viv\u2014it\u2019s a long story",
      "content": "Dag Kittlaus was the founder and CEO of Siri, Inc. which produced an app that went into the Apple App Store in February 2010. The app quickly rose to 1st place in the Lifestyle section of the app store. In March, 2010, Steve Jobs called Kittlaus and started the dialogue that ended when Apple acquired Siri at the end of April 2010.Siri cost Apple around $200 million. In addition to the acquisition of the technology the purchase was also a smart competitive move because Siri was working on adapting the app to work on Nokia and Android phones. At the time they sold the company to Apple, Siri had 24 employees. As the team moved into the Apple apparatus, and for the next 18 months, Kittlaus headed the team at Apple that applied Siri technology to the iPhone 4S which was launched in October 2011, the month in which Steve Jobs died.The Siri app was free for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch users. The algorithms that made the app work, however, were the product of years of defense-sponsored research at SRI International. SRI spun out Siri, Inc. in 2008 to commercialize their work. This included the three Siri founders: Kittlaus, Tom Gruber, CTO, and Adam Cheyer, VP Engineering. They named the company \"Siri,\" a Norwegian girls' name. Silicon Valley venture capital firms Menlo Ventures and Morgenthaler Ventures poured $24 million into the technology that Kittlaus, Gruber and Cheyer built into the Siri app.After Jobs died, Kittlaus resigned and went back to Chicago to be near his family. Liv, his mother, was a native of Norway, and met Dag's father, Karl, when he was serving with the U.S. Air Force in France. The couple settled in Palos Heights, Ill., a Chicago suburb, and had two sons. Whenever possible, Liv took them to visit her parents and sister in Norway. Doug went to Norway and completed his MBA at BI Norwegian Business School, in Oslo and stayed in Norway for seven more years. He began his career in technology at the Scandinavian telecom giant, Telenor Mobile. Returning to the United States, he worked at Motorola for five years and then went to work with SRI and the Siri project.In 2012 Kittlaus and a small group - including Cheyer and Brigham - created a new startup, Viv Labs and their AI Viv, named after Kittlaus\u2019 mother but also the Latin root meaning live. In May, 2016 Kittlaus demonstrated Viv at a TechCrunch Disrupt event in New York. The demonstration showed that Viv was a breakthrough accomplishment in providing a single conversational user interface (UI) to recognize our words, determine our intent, and then write code to effect that intent. At the demonstration Kittlaus said that search wasn't going anywhere but as Viv and other new AI assistants become more capable and become the primary resource for users, people really won't want to go back to the old way.Enter Samsung, 5G and the Internet of Things. On October 5, 2016, Samsung announced that it had acquired Viv Labs for an undisclosed amount. As part of the acquisition, the Viv founding team will work closely with Samsung\u2019s Mobile Communications business, but continue to operate independently.\u201cUnlike other existing AI-based services, Viv has a sophisticated natural language understanding, machine learning capabilities and strategic partnerships that will enrich a broader service ecosystem,\u201d said Injong Rhee, CTO of the Mobile Communications business at Samsung Electronics. \u201cViv was built with both consumers and developers in mind. This dual focus is also what attracted us to Viv as an ideal candidate to integrate with Samsung home appliances, wearables and more, as the paradigm of how we interact with technology shifts to intelligent interfaces and voice control.\u201dIn addition to their phone business, as we near 2020, when the new 5G telecom systems begin to be deployed, starting first in Korea in 2018 and Asia in 2019 and 2020, appliance makers such as Korean Samsung foresee the interaction of their devices with the Internet in all sorts of ways. Machine-to-machine technology, including robots, self-driving cars and other cognitive computing systems that are able to make decisions and solve problems without human intervention, is here now but growing in capabilities daily, and will soon be engrained in our daily lives as the capabilities of the 5G networks kick in. Human-machine-interaction such as that offered by Viv will be facilitated by 5G.[NOTE: Samsung isn't the only buyer of this type of UI technology. Last month Google acquired API.ai, a 2011 startup providing a virtual digital assistant. In December 2014, the company pivoted to focus on becoming a developer platform for natural language processing (NLP). Their platform enables developers to create their own voice apps across a range of end markets, including the mobile device, wearables, robotics, automotive, and smart home markets.]{NOTE 2: In a move similar to Samsung's acquisition of Viv to enable integrating it with Samsung home appliances, Amazon just partnered with KITT.ai, another developer of conversation-driven interfaces for developers, to make it easier for developers to use voice-controlled products using the Alexa Voice Service.]It's all about bandwidth and speed as the chart from Akamai shows. There is a steady upward demand for connection and, once connected, speed of transaction.5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology and offers a major advance in the number of simultaneous connections that mobile networks can support - up to a million connections per 1/3 mile. Apart from providing massive capacity, 5G users will see significantly improved network speeds and low latency, well beyond the capabilities of 4G. Data speeds on 5G are estimated to reach 20 times faster than current 4G networks. Estimates suggest that 5G users would be able to download a full-length, high-definition movie in just one second. In addition, 5G is expected to come with an ultra-low latency rate of less than 1 millisecond. Existing 4G networks have a latency of 10 milliseconds. Latency is defined as the amount of time it takes for a packet of data to get from one point to another. The ultra low latency also means that advanced applications, such as autonomous driving, can be supported by 5G networks with precision.Personal assistants are all about simplifying the process of performing daily tasks. They are attempting to be what you would expect of a knowledgeable executive assistant working alongside to maximize your productivity and minimize your involvement, a person who really knows you and doesn't need you to reexplain things over and over. The list of vendors is impressive: Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, Baidu, Microsoft, Apple, SoftBank, all the car companies, smaller companies like Jibo, and many large consumer product providers - including Samsung.To date, none have achieved that sweet spot where end users are fully satisfied. The holdup has been the software, the need for extensive coding, and the ability to identify \"intent\" from sounds recognized as words. The breakthrough technology that Viv is offering is a way to change the way programmers work with computers and developers offer their products. Programmers will no longer have to instruct step-by-step procedures in rigid code, but instead they'll just have to describe the process and intent and the AI will develop the code - it will write the programs needed on the fly. And developers will just need to add Viv as their conversational UI.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "September continued the big-money spree for funding robotic startups. 10 good-sized deals and three little ones. Almost $220 million (bringing the year-to-date total well over $1 billion)! Plus another $2.2 billion paid in September for six acquisitions.Carbon 3D, a Silicon Valley 3D printer startup, raised $81 million from a group of 6 investors led by BMW Group and Sequoia Capital, GE, Nikon, JSR and GV. The funds will be used for international expansion. Parts made on Carbon machines, using the company\u2019s resins and elastomers, have different mechanical properties and a smoother surface than parts produced on traditional CNC machines because they\u2019re not deposited layer by layer, cut or milled. Instead, they\u2019re sculpted by precisely applying light and oxygen to a liquid pool of material. BMW and Ford are early users of this technology. Carbon CEO and co-founder Joe DeSimone said:\u201cWe believe that 3-d printing is a misnomer. It\u2019s historically 2-d printing over and over again and the breakthrough we [had] and wrote about in the research journal Science laid out our approach where we use light and oxygen to grow parts.\u201dZymergen, a Silicon Valley integrator of lab robotics in industrial biotech, raised $42 million in a Series A funding led by Data Collective and including AME Cloud Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurveston, HVF, Innovation Endeavors, Obvious Ventures, True Ventures and Two Sigma Ventures.Mazor Robotics (in August) completed the second tranche of the equity investment by Medtronic pursuant to a previously executed agreement between the parties. Mazor issued new securities representing 3.40% percent of Mazor's issued and outstanding share capital at a price equal to an aggregate purchase price of $20 million.Saildrone, an Alameda, CA startup, raised $14M in a Series A funding round led by Social Capital with additional funds from Capricorn Investment and Lux Capital. The funding will be used to expand Saildrone's fleet of sailing drones, enhance Saildrone's data processing capacity, and scale commercial operations.Drone Racing League has raised $12 million in new VC funding co-led by Lux Capital and RSE Ventures. Other backers include MGM, Sky Prosieben, Hearst Ventures, CAA Ventures, Vayner/RSE, Courtside Ventures, Sierra Maya Ventures and individual angels.Sarcos Robotics, a Salt Lake City maker of military exoskeleton robots, has secured $10.5 million in funding from investors including Microsoft, Caterpillar Ventures, GE Ventures, Cottonwood Technology Fund and two unnamed private investment firms. Sarcos says it will use the funds to grow its team and bring its Guardian line of robotics to market. Beyond the obvious military applications, Sarcos envisions possibilities for the machines in a number of industries, ranging from oil and gas to mining to construction and manufacturing.\"There is substantial demand for robots that can carry out challenging tasks that are too dangerous or difficult for humans.  Our human-operated robots are designed to perform meaningful, highly dexterous work in real-world settings while keeping people out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Ben Wolff, Sarcos\u2019 CEO.Rapyuta Robotics, a spin-off from the ETH Zurich, recieved $10M in a Series A funding round from SBI Investments, a Japanese VC. Funding will be used to support and expand its engineering team in order to accelerate development of additional features and new products, testing, and product release schedules plus funding of sales, and marketing efforts. Rapyuta is aiming to commercialize the RoboEarth project of enabling robots to talk and learn with and from other robots over the cloud.Mavrx, a San Francisco startup using imagery and data to make prescriptions for the ag industry, raised $10M in a Series A round led by Eclipse with Bloomberg Beta and Visionnair Ventures.Titan Medical, a Canadian startup involved in the design and development of a robotic surgical system, completed a public offering which raised $7.2 million. John Hargrove, Titan\u2019s CEO, said: \u201cWe believe we have [with these new funds] sufficient funds on hand to enable us to move forward with the advancement of human factors and usability studies of the surgical system.\"Navisens, a SF software, systems and AI startup, got $2.6 million in seed funding in a round led by Resolute Ventures with participation from KEC Ventures, Amicus Capital, Arba Seed Investment Group, and angel investor Gokul Rajaram. The company is introducing its patent-pending technology, motionDNA, a location solution that employs motion sensors for both indoor and outdoor location solutions.OnFarm, a Fresno, CA ag startup, got an additional $125k in seed funding from 500 Startups, a Silicon Valley VC focusing on providing seed funding and startup coaching. OnFarm is developing a network of sensors, weather, maps, equipment and historical crop data and providing analytical and prescriptive data as a service.Appolo Shield, an Israeli startup that is moving to Silicon Valley, received $120k in seed funding from Y Combinator. The company is developing an anti-drone system to actively protect sensitive areas. Their software takes control of intruding drones and commands them to land.Raptor Maps, a Somerville, MA startup, received $200k in seed funding from Y Combinator (in August). Raptor is providing RaaS by capturing images and providing mapping data.Apple acquired India-based Tuplejump, a machine learning startup for an undisclosed amount. This is after an August acquisition of Turi, another machine learning platform for, what Geekwire suggests as upwards of $200 million.Intel acquired Irish Movidius, a maker of image-processor chips for drones and virtual reality for $400 million. Movidius\u2019 chips help drones and smartphones recognize faces and read signs without needing to stream to the cloud and wait for a response.GE pays $1.4 billion to acquire two metal-based additive manufacturing makers:Hocomo, a Swiss provider of robotic and sensor-based rehabilitation solutions, merged with Chinese DIH International to provide comprehensive rehab solutions. Financial terms were not disclosed. DIH International is a corporate holding group from Hong Kong with offices in China, Korea, the Netherlands and the US. The merged entity will become a full solution provider for the entire rehabilitation marketplace.Cabinplant A/S, a Danish integrator of food processing equipment including a sardine packing robot cell, has sold 80% of their shares to CTB, a Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffet) company that designs, manufactures and markets ag, dairy and poultry processing equipment. Cabinplant employs 300 people and has representatives in more than 30 countries worldwide. No amount was disclosed regarding the transaction, however based on 2015 sales of $43M (from their annual report), and presuming a 10X revenue (predicated on what GE paid for the two 3D printer companies), it seems likely the selling price was in the range of $200M to $400M.CTB\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer Victor A. Mancinelli said, \u201cThe acquisition helps CTB to broaden the range of poultry processing options it can offer its customers as well as expanding into new market areas for processing, such as seafood and vegetables.

Puig has given permission to republish his review of the show.The well-known companies in the Commercial UAV market, as expected, had large booths: DJI, Parrot, Yuneec, SenseFly, Aerialtronics, Tarot, showing rotary and fixed wing solutions, but also I found some other solutions in this trade fair:I heard some people expected much more innovative solutions in this trade fair, but the reality is that the drones sector is maturing slowly, step by step. The main technical areas that require improvements are well known: flight endurance, sense & avoid (no collision), autonomous navigation in constrained areas and fail-safe reliable systems. The drone applications are available, but the former improvements are needed to give the professional drone market real exponential growth.\n\nIndeed, many global companies are working for this market, going after the Treasure Island promised by most of the sales forecast statistics. But an important question is how to survive to this difficult, expensive and long trip. Unfortunately, I found many companies making bad choices that may make them lose the race very soon:  This is a new technology, still in its infancy, in a world that is becoming more and more global and commercially hungry and aggressive. Companies need to strategically plan and carefully execute to compete in this market.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportAlejandro Alonso-Puig is CTO of Infinium Robotics, a Singapore UAS startup.Read more \u00bb",

      "title": "A look at a Danish robotics cluster",
      "content": "There are many robotics clusters around the world successfully providing for the needs of their respective communities and a few not really achieving their desired goals. Odense and the Danish clusters certainly fall into the former category. They do so because they are organized at every level to be offering and have people that are business smart, humble and cooperative in approach, and public-spirited in nature.Clusters are a big thing in the incubation, funding and nurturing of roboticists and their enterprises. There are many stakeholders: companies that use robots; governments that want to turn technology into tax-paying entities and jobs; engineers and entrepreneurs that want to learn and be inspired by successes and about the startup scene; students that want to see where the jobs are; executives who want good local talent and help in navigating local regulations; investors who want to participate in the space; and educators who want to know there will be uses for their research, training and students.On a recent trip to Denmark, a country with less than 6 million people, I saw firsthand the magnitude and power of a successful, working robotics cluster and how it can be an equalizer as well as an instigator. For example, Denmark is 7th in global robot density, i.e., the number of multipurpose industrial robots per 10,000 employees in the manufacturing sector (behind Korea, Singapore, Japan, Germany, Sweden and Taiwan) and Denmark doesn't have an auto industry contributing to those figures.The four maps on the right show the location and types of companies involved in the robotics industry in Denmark. These companies design, develop, manufacture and integrate robots and are included in the directories of The Robot Report. [Did you know The Robot Report has a large directory covering the robotics industry and that they are all plotted on a global map which is freely accessible online?]In the lower center of each map is the island of Fyn and in the upper center of Fyn is Odense, the city and area I visited. Clusters are organized to bring together and share expertise, funding, leadership, and coaching to help make businesses successful, productive, profitable and employ people from the community. Clusters help stimulate innovation and startups, and keep workers and stakeholders informed and happy in, and pleased with, their industry. They offer expertise in international trading and collaboration. [For the purposes of this article, when I refer to a cluster I'm talking about those focused on fostering the development of robotics.]Clusters don't just happen by accident. They need knowledge sharing, community spirit and participation by all of the stakeholders. They need nearby universities to crank out students (particularly grad students) while researching breakthrough technologies. [Some examples of top-notch technical universities and the areas they cover include the Boston-Cambridge area (MIT, Boston University and Harvard), Pittsburgh (Carnegie Mellon University), Zurich (ETH Zurich and University of Zurich), Silicon Valley and SF Bay Area (Stanford and UC Berkeley), and Tokyo (University of Tokyo and Tokyo Institute of Technology).]Clusters need successes so that there's money to invest, mentors to provide coaching, and stories to be told.They need a strong technical educational system not only to provide new talent, but to research and develop new solutions to local problems. Finally, clusters need organization and help navigating technology transfer issues, local regulations, securing governmental incentives, startup help and scale-up assistance. Universities and government-sponsored funding agencies often offer these services as do accelerators and venture capital firms - but with varying levels of capability. Successful cluster organizations help cut through all the bureaucracies and expedite what needs to be done.Clusters can be planned. In China the national government has outlined and funded a massive plan to make robotics a domestic industry instead of buying robots from offshore companies. They have mandated 20 regional universities and local governments to work together to develop the technologies, incubate and fund startups, provide them with office and factory space, funding incentives, and get them up and producing. Another example is in the U.S.: the University of California San Diego (UCSD) is investing in making itself a hub for cognitive, embedded technologies and communication sciences involved in robotics by adding teaching/research staff (as UCSD is doing), by working together with venture capitalists, local tech businesses (particularly Qualcomm, whose microchips are widely used in smartphones and other wireless devices), local military research labs, startup companies, and the research labs and programs already existent at UCSD and in the area. [San Diego has major industry and defense employers with many robotics technologies and applications. There are also significant manufacturing sectors in San Diego and nearby Tijuana. And UCSD is a major plus as well. It already has a Flow Control & Coordinated Robotics Lab, a Computer Vision and Robotics Research Lab, an Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Control Lab, the Artificial Intelligence Group, and the Contextual Robotics Institute, to name just a few... plus it is located in beautiful La Jolla north of San Diego. UCSD is also nearby the Scripps and Salk Institutes.] Not all planned clusters achieve their goal. Each of the stakeholders has to play their part and serendipity also has a role in making a successful robotics cluster. Numerous cities and areas have tried and failed. Many are hopeful of success (and we are hopeful for them as well). Many are successful and productive such as RoboValley in The Netherlands, the Boston/Cambridge cluster, the cluster in Pittsburgh and the SF Bay Area/Silicon Valley cluster. It really needs active community spirit and some level of altruism. An example is the Silicon Valley cluster which struggles to get beyond an elitist flavor (which I perceive as selfishness). They have everything going for them - frequent get-togethers, lots of success stories, plentiful sources of money, multiple accelerators, really talented people including the scattering of the Willow Garage people, but they can't shake the elitest label. Billionaire Scott Hassan founded Willow Garage with a public-spirited goal to develop a general-purpose personal robot to move around a house and help the daily life of people. Willow Garage was founded in 2006 (and closed in 2014) and operated something like Bell Labs and Xerox Parc did in, and for, the PC industry: it developed the open source robotics software system (ROS) and the TurtleBot and PR2. Willow Garage funded 60 research scientists each year in an ever-changing cadre that have since migrated to prominent robotics startups and businesses around the Bay Area (and world), all stimulated by an altruistic billionaire.\"The Odense cluster began 25 years ago when Maersk was planning to build an advanced shipyard in Odense and robotic welding and the advanced software for operating self-programming robots were to play big roles. They sought help and made sizeable donations to South Denmark University (SDU). Many of the key people in today's robot scene were educated during that period, (e.g., Claus Risager was a project engineer at the shipyard and now heads the Danish Technological Institute (DTI) with a robotics division in Odense. Enrico Iversen, Thomas Visti and Esben \u00d8stergaard, CEO, COO and CTO of Universal Robots (UR), all graduated from SDU).  As the shipyard closed the robotics people moved around. The SDU assisted in the creation of UR. The MIR people [a recent mobile robotics startup in Odense with Thomas Visti as CEO] were involved in the early stage of UR. It is all a very well connected community. At the same time the Danish culture is very much a sharing one and much less competitive than the US system. As the shipyard closed down the Mayor and local politicians have been very supportive of the creation of new companies to support the local economy. Many people from that time have been key to the success. It is an ideal combination of technology, business development and entrepreneurs,\" said Henrik Christensen, a Dane that was a founder of EURON and later headed the US group that produced the American Roadmap for US Robotics. Christensen is now the director of the Contextual Robotics Institute at UC San Diego.Clusters often ride on the coattails of successful companies. This is certainly the case with the Odense cluster. Universal Robots (UR) has become a country-wide hero in Denmark and particularly in Odense, where it is headquartered and where it employs 300+ people. Universal Robots recently sold to an American supplier of test equipment, Teradyne, for $315.4 million (according to Teradyne's Edgar filing) making many of UR's top people multi-millionaires. And those very same people are already reinvesting some of their money in new ventures in Odense.The Odense cluster is multi-layered. They cooperate with national government-sponsored organizations such as RoboCluster; they work hand-in-hand with the main local university (U of Southern Denmark) and hundreds of other robot companies, research organizations and national clusters and networks. The chart below - which you can enlarge by clicking on it - provides details of the 30+ higher education programs, 10+ knowledge and research institutes, 80+ robot and automation companies and 10+ clusters and networks, plus the 2,200+ robotics-related jobs in the Odense area.On my visit I asked each person I met whether they had personally received any support from the Danish or Odense cluster and each offered a story or two that showed they had a favorable impression of those interactions, particularly with the Odense apparatus. One person said he was able, through the mayor's office, to expedite a zoning approval; another was able to work with the university (University of Southern Denmark) regarding research and finding talent; another said he got help finding local vendors capable of sub-contracting their needs; and many told me about encouraging foreign visits and assisting with foreign visitors. Others taught classes at SDU and hosted open houses at their robotics-related companies. They all told me about timely investments made by the Danish Growth Fund and other state-sponsored funding entities. I'd say that since everybody I talked with could cite an example of how they were helped by and spoke favorably toward the cluster, that the cluster was operating successfully.Another mark of a good cluster is the ability to provide local, regional and international media with timely newsworthy facts and figures; not just generic publicity but real and timely information. Universal Robots is a classic example: from their beginning they have had a bevy of PR firms working for them and operating from a policy of always providing real information, no matter the situation or circumstance. Generosity is a mental health principle: it is therapeutic. Lack of generosity takes many forms: tightness, negativity and elitism. There are many robotics clusters around the world successfully providing for the needs of their respective communities and a few not really achieving their desired goals. Odense and the Danish clusters certainly fall into the former category of successfully meeting the needs of their communities. In my opinion, they do so because they are organized at every level to be offering and have people in place that are business smart, humble and cooperative in approach, and public-spirited and generous in nature.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Pittsburgh and Singapore are now pilot sites for self-driving car services",
      "content": "Two self-driving car events of note: Uber just began operating a fleet of Volvo self driving cars in Pittsburgh, and nuTonomy launched the first autonomous pilot taxi program last month in Singapore. (Both still require a driver although he/she will be as hands-off as possible.)Both Uber and nuTonomy are offering \"fully autonomous\" or full self-driving automation technology for hire. In 2013, the US Department of Transportation issued a 'guidance' that defined five levels of automation. A 'Level 4' autonomous vehicle \"is designed to perform all safety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip. Such a design anticipates that the driver will provide destination or navigation input, but is not expected to be available for control at any time during the trip. This includes both occupied and unoccupied vehicles.\" Most cars with functional autonomy right now are at Level 3, with limited self-driving automation: the driver is expected to be available for control when necessary. It's a big step from Level 3 to Level 4, but the benefits are significant: in addition to leaving the driving completely to the car, it also means that the car is capable of driving itself with no human inside, which is what makes a robotic taxi service possible and why there is so much interest in the success of these services.NuTonomy said its new \u201crobo-taxi\u201d service, which includes specially configured Renault Zoe and Mitsubishi i-MiEV electric vehicles, will run within Singapore\u2019s One-North business district, where the company has been conducting daily autonomous vehicle testing since April. The vehicles are fully autonomous but an engineer from the company will ride in the vehicle both to monitor its performance and to take over control if required at some point for safety or other reasons.The pilot program uses smartphone app-based Uber-like call, instruct and pay software.The program is the result of an agreement between NuTonomy, a Cambridge, MA-based startup of two former MIT robotics and intelligent vehicle technology engineers, and Singapore\u2019s Land Transport Authority (LTA), for trials of an autonomous mobility-on-demand transportation service.The launch of Uber's self-driving pilot program unveils Uber's secretive autonomous vehicles program and marks the first time self-driving cars have been so freely available to the public.Quoting from a Reuters story:\"Uber provided ride-alongs to reporters on Tuesday. During a ride of about one hour, Reuters observed the Uber car safely - and for the most part smoothly - stop at red lights and accelerate at green lights, travel over a bridge, move around a mail truck and slow for a driver opening a car door on a busy street. All without a person touching the controls.\"Uber's Pittsburgh fleet consists of Volvo SUVs and Ford Fusion cars outfitted with 3D cameras, global positioning systems (GPS) and a LiDAR that uses lasers to assess the shape and distance of objects, all mounted with seeming lack of design to the vehicle's roof. Pittsburgh is full of steep hills and narrow streets, potholes, tunnels and more than 440 bridges. It has snow and ice in the winter, blossoming trees that can hide street signs and traffic signals in the spring, blinding sun in the summer and a slippery ground cover of fallen leaves in the autumn. But Pittsburgh also offers Uber city leadership who have rolled out the red carpet plus helped pass a state law that allows for autonomous cars (as long as someone is behind the wheel to take over if needed).Thus the merits of Uber's new program: if Uber can do it in Pittsburgh, they can do it anywhere.The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) and the Geneva-based International Organization for Standardization (ISO) have had an established definition for industrial robots for many years. Service robots, the everything else category, represents all other non-industrial robots. That's a tough category to define because it's a moving target as the industry grows and technologies improve. Now with questions rising about whether Level 3, 4 and 5 cars are robotic, or whether many consumer drones are just remote-controlled, the IFR has decided to hold workshops in October and November and release their findings and suggestions for redefining what is a robot by the end of the year.Here is the present IFR service robot definition:[A robot system is a system comprising robot(s), end-effector(s) and any machinery, equipment, devices, or sensors supporting the robot performing its task.]An industrial robot, as defined by ISO 8373:\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "International Data Corporation (IDC) has awarded five pioneering players in the warehouse robotics market with the 2016 IDC Innovators Award. Companies selected met the following criteria: revenue of less than $50 million with an innovative technology, or a groundbreaking new business model, or both.IDC is a global provider of market intelligence, advisory services, and events for the information technology, telecommunications, and consumer technology markets. With more than 1,100 analysts worldwide, IDC offers global, regional, and local expertise on technology and industry opportunities and trends in over 110 countries. Each year they award hundreds of innovator companies in trending industry segments. 2016\u2019s broad trending segments included:\"Robotics are increasingly being leveraged within warehouses to increase productivity and deliver efficiency improvements. Innovators, such as those that we have identified with these awards, are developing intelligent and collaborative robots to help manage the increased flow of goods through modern warehouses and support picking and packing strategies more aligned to the needs of today's omni-channel commerce,\" said John Santagate, research manager, Supply Chain Execution at IDC Manufacturing Insights.Warehouse robotics is definitely an emerging robotics industry segment as old-style AGVs are getting eyes and providing point-to-point movement. Combined with clever picking, storing and stocking methods and devices involving both humans and robots, this industry segment is able to handle more picks at a faster rate more reliably than before, hopefully keeping up with consumer demand. Many startups are focused on this area of warehouse robotic innovation complicated when Amazon decided to take Kiva Systems inhouse and not resell their systems. This caused a temporary technology void which is beginning to be filled by these new award-winning vendors - and many others.New vendors are being announced frequently, e.g.: inVia Robotics just today came out of stealth mode to launch their \u201cgoods-to-box\u201d combination of a grabit robot for picking and a transit robot to move picked goods from place to place.

      "title": "What happens when a robot company sells off a division?",
      "content": "Spin-offs are disrupting but often necessary. Here are two recent examples: iRobot sold off its Defense & Security Business Unit to a private equity firm, and Harvest Automation sold the IP and work in process of its warehousing robot group to a new venture-backed startup.iRobot's Defense & Security Business Unit, according to their annual report, averaged $50 million in sales for three years in a row (2013, 2014 and 2015) while home robots rose from $428 million to $560 million during the same period. The defense unit had difficulty as the wars ended in Iraq and Afghanistan and the DoD and DARPA reduced spending. Simultaneously iRobot was being hounded by activist shareholders to rid itself of the unit so that it could focus on the consumer market. This led to a heated proxy fight about adding activist board members. iRobot won that fight but also announced that it had changed its strategy and decided not to pursue DoD funded research.iRobot appears to be going about ridding itself of non-consumer products and services. In February 2016, iRobot reached a deal with Arlington Capital Partners, a DC-based private equity firm focused on DoD and government vendors, to sell the unit to Arlington for $45 million. The deal was concluded in April when Arlington established a new company, Endeavor Robotics, manned by the 100-person iRobot staff and Defense Unit executives, and housed in the same but separate facilities adjacent to iRobot.Less publicized but similarly focused on getting the company 100% into the consumer market was the announcement by iRobot that they were planning to \"end our remaining Remote Presence marketing and business development initiatives. As we reported on our Q4 2015 call, we had already reallocated R&D resources, from a next generation Remote Presence platform, to consumer opportunities. Going forward, 100% of the company\u2019s resources will be exclusively focused on the consumer.\" Their Remote Presence Unit consisted of the AVA line of mobile robots and their joint ventures with InTouch Health and Cisco. When I asked what this meant, iRobot responded:During the second quarter, iRobot made the decision to end its remaining Remote Presence marketing and business development initiatives \u2013 ending the productizing of Ava 500. While iRobot believes that there is a future in remote presence, the Ava 500 market didn't develop fast enough to justify sustaining the ongoing investment. As iRobot previously reported on its Q4 2015 investor call in February, the company had already reallocated Remote Presence R&D resources, from a next generation Remote Presence platform, to consumer opportunities.As iRobot\u2019s greatest opportunities currently lie in developing robotic solutions for the home, the company must put its focus toward this effort to reach its full potential. Going forward, 100% of the company\u2019s resources will be exclusively focused on the consumer market.Through its venture unit, iRobot has invested in 6 River Systems, a startup attempting to provide a warehousing solution to the problems caused by Kiva Systems and their novel goods-to-man mobile robot system taken in-house by Amazon and becoming unavailable to all others. That iRobot investment, plus their forthcoming robotic lawnmower, and their new arrangement with Amazon Cloud Services, which may enable connected home access for iRobot products, all offer new commercial opportunities for growth. Also, their new Shanghai facility and Asian e-commerce operation are coming online and they have high hopes for both of those activities.\u201cOur team is developing innovative new technology that will propel our growth, as well as actively reviewing acquisition opportunities that will continue to position Endeavor Robotics as an industry leader. The U.S. Department of Defense is planning at least three major ground robot program acquisitions in the next few years. Based on our combat-proven platforms and leading technology, Endeavor Robotics is well-positioned for all three. We anticipate substantial growth over the next several years, both domestically and with our international customers,\" said Tom Frost, President of Endeavor Robotics.\u201cAs an independent company dedicated to tactical robotics, Endeavor Robotics will have new flexibility to meet the needs and protect the lives of our customers serving on the frontline and in dangerous environments. We\u2019ve always done our best work when we worked closely with our customers. Our new structure enables us to double down on that strategy. We believe that the future is in open architecture and collaborative solutions and we look forward to making that a reality.\u201dShortly after the transfer and their opening vision statements, Endeavor announced two strategic partnerships with RE2 Robotics and Persistent Systems. Both arrangements appear to be geared toward winning the DoD's three upcoming ground robot proposals.Although Endeavor hasn't announced any new contracts thus far, there was a year's worth of existing DoD contracts transferred with the sale/spin-off plus they have Arlington Capital to help with funding.Throughout 2015, for a year and a half, Harvest Automation split their energies between their business in agricultural field robots that transported and positioned potted plants, and a new, flexible material handling robot, in a new and separate work division. The new robot would work in factories, warehouses and distribution centers. The results of this new division's efforts were uncertain, optimistic, and costly. During those 18 months the ag business went dormant and key people left. Joe Jones, one of the founders and CTO, left to lead a startup developing a robotic weeding device for home gardens. Others joined Harvest to help transition the single-purpose field robot with a limited skill set into a multi-purpose, self-navigating, material handling robot in an even bigger warehousing pick-and-transport system. MaryEllen Sparrow came with a background in warehousing and distribution center software to head up the software development team. Funding got hard because the transition was taking longer and costing more than expected and their first product demonstrations left much to be desired. Although the agricultural side of the business, headed by Charlie Grinnell, was self-sufficient, it didn't generate enough money to fund the warehousing robot project, and the company, in order to stay afloat and preserve the ag business, decided to sell off the assets, intellectual property and prototypes for the material handling operation for an undisclosed amount to a few angel investors including Sparrow.Harvest Automation, and its now-strictly ag business, is attempting to recover from being inactive for so long, and is also developing new ag services such as helping pickers by moving their harvested items to the packing station and bringing them containers. Harvest Automation is hoping to expand its target audience from nurseries to vegetable and fruit growers.NextShift Robotics is the entity created by the angel investors that acquired the IP and prototypes. MaryEllen Sparrow became the CEO. She and a very small team are working to get their new robots to be able to take a tote and transport it from point to point as directed by an elaborate warehouse management and ordering system. This involves improving their method of navigation, their approach to getting goods onto the robot's carrying platform, and the warehouse management and ordering system control and integration software.NextShift expects to trial their new creation later this year at a couple of pilot warehouse locations.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "As Intuitive Surgical continues to shine, competitors are entering the fray",
      "content": "Robotic surgery has long been dominated by Intuitive Surgical which has placed more than 3,600 of its da Vinci machines in hospitals around the world. Nevertheless, an increasing number of new players are entering the marketplace.The number of surgical procedures that use Intuitive Surgical's machines, ~700,000 in 2015, has steadily risen and was 15% year-over-year 2014 to 2015. According to Fortune, within five years 1/3 of U.S. surgeries (from 15% today) will be performed with robotic systems, with surgeons sitting at computer consoles guiding mechanical arms.Most top hospitals have invested in these robots which cost an average of $1.5 million and entail ongoing maintenance and procedures' expenses. The metrics, however, are such that insurers pay no more for surgeries that utilize the systems than for other types of minimally-invasive procedures, such as laparoscopy. Because of patents and aggressive protection of their IP, Intuitive Surgical is the only game in town. But technology is improving, methods are changing, and a fleet of new competitors - some with very deep pockets - are entering the marketplace.One market analyst said that \"robotics has only penetrated 5-10% of surgical procedures so there is a big opportunity for increased expansion for several players in the market.\" In the chart on the right prepared by Verb Surgical, one can see the growing blue of robotic-assisted procedures and the barely touched laparoscopy procedures on the horizon.\"The surgical robot device market was estimated to be $3.2 billion in 2014 and forecast to reach $20 billion by 2021 as next generation devices, systems and instruments are introduced to manage surgery through small ports in the body instead of large open wounds. The market is characterized by enormous variety and innovation. Products range from snake robots to navigation systems to highly articulated devices such as the da Vinci system. This growth industry will involve many shifts in ownership and funding,\" suggests WinterGreen Research in their 553 page, $4,000 report published in April.Fortune compiled a wish list from surgeons for improvements they would like to see in new robotic systems:Verb Surgical, with deep pockets from partners Google/Alphabet and Johnson & Johnson, and next-gen robotics technology licensed from SRI, Verb is building a surgical platform that will leverage robots, advanced imaging, machine learning, big data, and advanced instrumentation so physicians can use it in both open and minimally invasive procedures. In other words, their goal is to \u201cdemocratize surgery\u201d and give physicians more choice. Verb also envisions a system that is \"always there, always on,\" enabling the surgeon to use the robot for parts of a procedure as needed. Both Google and J&J are expected to focus on big data. \u201cBeing able to record and analyze your procedure from a big data point of view can really help make robotic surgeries more repeatable,\u201d said one financial analyst.Medtronic, another deep pockets provider, is partnering with Mazor Robotics to buy and promote Mazor's surgical spine systems. Medtronic also bought the gynecology business unit of Smith & Nephew, a competing medical device company, and Covidien, a Boston surgical robotics company that was developing a competing surgical robot system to the da Vinci, to help jump-start Medtronic's entry into this segment of the business. Medtronic has said it expects to launch its surgical robot before mid-2018 and will start in India.TransEnterix, a Canadian publicly-traded company, recently had a setback with their SurgiBot System which was turned down by the FDA. They'll have to go through a long and arduous trial process which may take a few years to get approved. As a backup plan, TransEnterix acquired the surgical robotics division of SOFAR Spa, an Italian healthcare and pharma company which has spearheaded the TELELAP ALF-X project (Advanced Laparoscopy through Force Reflection) for many years. TransEnterix just made their first sale of the ALF-X system to a hospital in Milan, Italy. The ALF-X is a slightly cheaper robotic system with lower costs-per-procedure than the da Vinci Xi system. The four-armed Alf-X, which has many features that da Vinci lacks such as eye-tracking software and haptic feedback which enables surgeons to regain a sense of touch and pressure feedback that they currently have to forgo. TransEnterix has been granted a CE Mark for the ALF-X but doesn't yet have FDA approval.Titan Medical, a Toronto-based publicly-traded company, is developing the Sport Surgical System, a system with a surgeon workstation, a mobile cart for single-incision camera and tube insertion, and a line of multi-articulated instruments, which will debut in the United States mid 2017. The Titan robotic surgical system is being designed to expand robotic surgery into areas of surgical specialties and simple and complex procedures that are currently underserviced, and to allow surgeons to perform procedures within small to medium size surgical spaces such as general surgery and cholecystectomy.Medrobotics\u2019 Flex Robotic System provides robot-assisted visualization and surgical site access to the larynx in adults and allows the use of a whole range of compatible flexible instruments through accessory channels it creates. Their system enables \u0003minimally invasive procedures in locations that were \u0003previously difficult-to-reach.Smith & Nephew, the same company that sold their gynocological division to Medtronic, recently acquired Blue Belt Technologies, which developed and offers a hand-held surgical system they call Navio for partial knee replacement using advanced robotics-assisted instruments. Navio integrates hand-held instruments with a CT-free navigation, registration and patient-specific planning process so that the surgeon has a virtual plan which removes the need for standard mechanical cutting guides and jigs.OMNI, previously named Orthopaedic Synergy and OMNILife Sciences, offers their OMNIBotics robotic-assisted hip and knee replacement system that combines navigation robotic systems and practices, implants, specialized tools, and patented technology, with advanced robotics, to help surgeons place and fit implants with greater accuracy compared to conventional approaches. Auris Surgical Robotics recently announced that Fred Moll, the entrepreneur behind Intuitive Surgical, Hansen Medical and Origin Medsystems, received $149.5 million in equity funding for his stealthy startup. Auris, founded in 2011, described itself as a venture-funded company developing a robotic microsurgical system designed specifically for opthalmic surgery. The company says they are deep in stealth mode with no comment about the funding or how it will be used. However, they purchased Hansen Medical in a deal which transfers intravascular robotic technology and IP to Auris.Stryker, in 2013, for $1.65 billion, acquired Mako Surgical. Stryker CEO Kevin Lobo said he will delay Mako's total knee surgical system introduction till 2017 even though it has already received FDA approval. \"The aim is to develop the clinical evidence and experience necessary to maximize chances for a successful commercial launch.\"Medtech designs, develops and markets a new generation of robotic assistance for the express purpose of improved surgical techniques. Medtech has two robotic products: ROSA and ROSA Brain. ROSA is an integrated multi-application console that acts as a reliable and accurate surgical assistant and a 6 DOF arm whose architecture replicates the movements of a human arm. To date, ROSA is the only robotic assistant approved for neurosurgical procedures in clinical use in Europe, the United States and Canada.Cambridge Medical Robotics (CMR) is a UK startup developing a universal robotic system for minimal access surgeries. CMR received $20 million in a Series A funding round in July and is developing a next-generation robotic system to meet all of the perceived needs of robotically-assisted surgical procedures as well as to expand the market and make the benefits of minimal access surgery universally accessible and affordable.There are other companies in the process of researching and developing robotic surgical devices, particularly in Korea, Japan and China. These include some well-funded and well-established medical device companies getting governmental support to help them be competitive with Western medical robotic companies. Those companies will be profiled in a future article.Intuitive is quite profitable. In their most recent quarterly earnings report (Q2 2016) they showed 16% growth year-over-year and net income of $185 million for the quarter, compared with $135 million for the same quarter of 2015.Intuitive also has problems: according to its 2015 Annual Report, the company is a defendant in 92 individual product liability lawsuits about patients who were either injured or died. The company is also a defendant in a Missouri lawsuit that represents 55 plaintiffs. To settle other lawsuits Intuitive recorded pretax charges of $13.8 million and $82.4 million in 2014 and 2015, respectively.Aside from battling legal claims, the company has also faced criticism from those who question the value of robotic surgery. The Wall Street Journal reported that researchers at Columbia University found robotic surgery led to higher costs and more complications when compared with laparoscopic surgery for removing ovaries and ovarian cysts. Conversely, the study barely mentioned that the results were reversed for prostate surgeries.Brian Miller, senior vice president of product development for Intuitive said that Intuitive was ready for the competition:\u201cWe look at competition really as just confirming that the robot-assisted surgery market will continue to grow. It\u2019s something that we believe, and clearly shows that people who are entering are recognizing and realizing they can\u2019t stay on the sidelines any longer.\u201d\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "July fundings, acquisitions and failures",
      "content": "Despite all the high-profile billion-dollar acquisitions, eg: ARM by SoftBank, KUKA by Midea and Uber China by Didi Chuxing, M&A are down 19% this year according to both Forbes and CB Insights. Buyers are buying, but they are seeking cash-positive market-realistic targets. Values (both monetary and vanity) are taking a hit. What\u2019s a startup to do? According to CB Insights, startups can (1) get bought at a lower valuation and take the hit; (2) lower their cash burn rate and play the long game;  or, (3), if they already have strong fundamentals and good growth, continue on.Nevertheless, July's fundings and acquisitions were substantial, and this month we've added a new ancillary category (Related fundings) to give an indication of the level of funding in AI and deep learning startups.According to TechSci Research, the artificial intelligence (AI) industry is projected to grow at a CAGR of around 75% during 2016-2021. Continuous research and development in healthcare, autonomous vehicles, security and access control, robotics-as-a-service, agriculture, cyber security, and other verticals are expected to fuel the growth as are smart wearables, and the head-up display screen market. Frost & Sullivan\u2019s report about deep learning enabling the unraveling of layers of patterns in data is also propelling the AI boom. This is where it becomes really interesting both users and makers of robotics. Frank Chen, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture capital and private equity firm, said of deep learning: It is absolutely non-controversial that deep learning is the most fundamental advance in A.I. research since the start [of A.I.] in 1956. We [Andreessen Horowitz] think A.I. and deep learning can be a fundamental and technology platform shift as mobile and cloud have been in the last 5-10 years... All the serious applications from here on out need to have deep learning and AI inside in exactly the same way that all serious computing systems needed to have Intel chips inside of them. I think now about the startups that we see, that deep learning needs to be inside these new systems as a fundamental technique that we expect to see in all serious applications moving forward.Read and view more about deep learning. With Frank Chen's words in mind, the following companies which got funded recently are blurring the line between robots, robotics and bots powered by AI, cloud computing, and deep learning analytics:\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Swiss startup makes good on Broadway",
      "content": "Flying robots perform 100th show on Broadway, using new localization technology and algorithms designed and created by Verity Studios of Zurich in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil for their new show PARAMOUR.Since April, a troupe of eight flying machines has been performing in a Cirque du Soleil Broadway show called PARAMOUR. This group of quadcopters has completed its first 100 shows in front of a live theater audience, without a single incident. Given the string of recent safety incidents with drones (there\u2019s more), this begs the question: How was this accomplished?The Paramour quadcopters were designed and created by Verity Studios of Zurich and were transformed into flying lampshades in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil. Some readers may recognize them as the direct siblings of the similarly dressed quadcopters in Sparked: A Live Interaction Between Humans and Quadcopters; a short movie shot over the span of two days in the controlled environment of a research lab (see previous Robohub article and Quadrotors vs. CGI Q&A.) What sets the Paramour quadcopters apart, and the key to their ongoing success on Broadway, are a new localization technology and fail-safe algorithms, that keep the fully redundant quadcopters safely on course, performing 8 times a week, in front of a live audience of up to 2,000 people, without nets.The people behind Verity Studios are no strangers to performing quadcopters. Founder Raffaello D\u2019Andrea is a professor of control systems at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), from which Verity Studios was spun off. From a lab aptly named the Flying Machine Arena he has been conducting research for over 10 years on complex, autonomous flight, using a high-precision motion capture system to guide the vehicles. The ETH team\u2019s first dancing drones performed in 2009 as part of research by Prof. D\u2019Andrea\u2019s former PhD students, Federico Augugliaro and Angela Schoellig. The group first stepped into the public performance space in 2011 with Flight Assembled Architecture, the world\u2019s first multi-quadcopter performance in front of a large audience. In all, more than 200 live research demonstrations have taken place so far in the Zurich lab with occasional appearances given abroad, such as Google IO 2012.While the team used motion capture technology extensively over this period, this type of localization technology proved inadequate for a long-running Broadway production when taken out of the research laboratory. The fundamental issue is that motion capture systems rely on a centralized architecture whereby all commands are forwarded to a single computer. A failure in that computer\u2019s hardware or software may cause a sudden loss of control for the complete fleet.Whereas an occasional failure of this type may be inconsequential in a research environment like the Flying Machine Arena, it is unacceptable for most commercial and industrial applications. The live events industry, in particular, has high safety standards owing in part to the amplification of safety risks when performing close to crowds of people. In addition to the safety risks, the consequences of a mishap entailing personal injury can be severe in terms of negative publicity, brand damage, and litigation.An alternative vision based system was used by Britain\u2019s Got Talent show where quadcopters used onboard cameras reading floor patterns to orient themselves. The number of quadcopters permitted is limited by occlusion once a critical level of vehicle density is reached. Furthermore, these systems can be compromised by external show-related light sources (e.g., stage lighting, spotlights), or even from the audience (e.g., laser pointers, flash-light photography), risking loss of control of some or all the vehicles; a major safety concern.To address these shortcomings, Verity Studios moved away from vision-based localization and developed a new system specifically for industrial applications that must meet strict safety and reliability standards. As stated by Raffaello D\u2019Andrea at a recent TED talk, both the new radio-frequency based proprietary localization system and the flying machines are redundant and use fail-safe algorithms such that every vehicle can withstand any single point of failure.Another key factor in the system\u2019s success is its interoperability within a theatrical environment. Any theatrical system must function within a complex ecosystem of stage automation where stringent industry standards prevail.\u201cThese flying machines have met or exceeded all expectations in terms of safety, reliability, maintenance, and ease of operation,\u201d states Michael Shepp, Automation Carpenter for Paramour.The technological achievement of creating a safe and robust system for flying a multitude of vehicles before a live audience introduces a rich palette for artistic expression. Creative staff at Cirque du Soleil recognized this potential and have worked side-by-side with Verity Studios to achieve this milestone on Broadway.Cirque du Soleil Chief Creative Officer, Jean-Francois Bouchard, states: \u201cThe flying machines are unquestionably one of the most important statements of the Paramour show.\u201dCirque du Soleil and Verity Studios are currently exploring the artistic use of flying machines in other upcoming productions.PARAMOUR runs at the Lyric Theatre (213 West 42nd Street) in New York.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportRobohub is a non-profit online communication platform that brings together experts in robotics research, start-ups, business, and education from across the globe.Go to Robohub.org \u00bb",

      "title": "Coming very soon: robots from Sony, robot-made hamburgers, mobile robot deliveries",
      "content": "Re-joining the ranks, Sony announced a return to robotics. Momentum is opening a robot hamburger shop. And Starship is beginning to delivery food to 3 cities in Europe.At a recent stockholders meeting, Sony Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai said that Sony, a conglomerate that has divisions in finance, network services and entertainment in addition to hardware, planned to move toward a more ambitious future and that robotics will play a role in that journey.\u201cWe need to push the envelope to really grow Sony into other parts in all of the electronics business, where we know we could make a difference,\u201d Mr. Hirai told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. \u201cYou can have all these great services and content, but there is a device you need to enjoy it, or actually to feed information to the network,\u201d he said.Hirai also said that Sony is planning a new wave of consumer robots that will be able to bond with humans suggesting that Sony will begin selling a competing line of products to SoftBank Robotics' Pepper home robots, Jibo, and Amazon's Alexa line. Sony already has an extensive electronics line including GoPro and drone add-on gimbals, cameras and other devices. Years ago Sony developed the Aibo robotic dog - a charming interactive product that sold 150,000 units from 1999 to 2006. Toward the end, Sony upgraded Aibo to use a camera to recognize its owner and added extra personalities to its repetoire of moves and responses. Competiting companies, particularly Dongbu Robot, a Korean company, use newer technology - and lower costs - to offer Aibo-like toy robot dogs.The business model for new Sony robotic products involves selling a robot that requires a reoccurring subscription service for data and maintenance with frequent software updates - a similar plan to Pepper.A June San Francisco area Craigslist ad advertised for a restaurant generalist to work at a Folsom Street store selling robot-made hamburgers. The store, at 680 Folsom Street, is on the ground floor of a 14-story office building, south of Market Street in the heart of San Francisco.\"This location will feature the world-premiere of our proprietary and remarkable new advances in technology that enable the automatic creation of impossibly delicious burgers at prices everyone can afford. The burgers sold at 680 Folsom will be fresh-ground and grilled to order, served on toasted brioche, and accented by an infinitely personalizable variety of fresh produce, seasonings, and sauces.\" Editorial comment: Wow! What a mouthful!SF is home to the popular automat-style restaurant Eatsa which takes orders for quinoa bowls via iPad and places them in cubby-holes ready for payment and pickup. The ordering process for Eatsa is to walk up to an iPad and construct and pay for your order whereupon it gets delivered to a cubby earmarked for you. It is likely that Momentum plans something similar for its new as-yet unnamed hamburger store, perhaps with a more personal delivery method combining other items like drinks and fries.Starship, a 55-person Estonian Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) startup funded by two of the founders of Skype, has been testing a mobile delivery robot in 12 countries for the last nine months. The devices have traveled 5,000 miles and met over 400,000 people according to Starship's Marketing and Comms Manager. We have learnt a lot in those 5000 miles of testing!  We learned that 60-65% of people don't pay the robot any attention. The robot integrates in public life a lot easier than we thought it would. The remaining % of people are overwhelmingly positive. We were also of course trial-ing the technology and the reliability of the robots. In all of these tests, we were pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe tests were conducted mainly in Tallinn, Estonia and London. We also tested in many other countries including the US, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Spain, etc. \n\n[Regarding our new trial], we haven't changed much, apart from putting more robots onto the streets for testing. We want to increase the number of miles driven on sidewalks around the world to get even more accurate data.  The major difference between our new testing program in UK, Germany and Switzerland is that, for the first time in our history, we are signing up commercial partners like Just Eat. This enables us to enter into a new phase of testing and start doing real world deliveries in real world environments. [In answer to a question as to the cost of the robot devices] We are a delivery company, and therefore it is unlikely we will be selling the robots. We will be providing a delivery service which includes the robots, the maintenance, the human oversight and everything inbetween! All for a monthly fee! \nStarship will be working with London food delivery startup Pronto as well as German parcel company Hermes and the Metro Group of retailers, plus Just Eat restaurant food delivery to trial on-your-schedule-delivery of packages, groceries and meals.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Six months worth of funding deals thus far in 2016 indicate that investments in robotics - equity fundings, and acquisitions - are accelerating, particularly in big deals involving Chinese money.Although Uber isn't really a robot company, they acquired a whole robotics department from CMU and have plans to work with car manufacturers to make unmanned Uber cars in the near future, hence they are included in this recap. Just last week Uber announced a strategic partnership - which included an investment of an undetermined amount - with Toyota.Uber has taken a $3.5 billion investment from a government that effectively prohibits women from driving\u2014let alone driving for Uber. Uber also has accepted a $3.5 billion investment from a government that requires women to have male guardians. Uber also has accepted a $3.5 billion investment from a government whose court system has sentenced men to jail time and corporal punishment for the \"crime\" of homosexuality\u2014not to mention all of the harsh sentences, sometimes including death, for political protest.Moreover, this is no passive investment. By naming political appointee Al Rumayyan, the company has basically invited the Saudi government into its board room. To my knowledge, no other Silicon Valley startup has a director from the sovereign wealth fund of a repressive political regime.Uber needed the money, and where else are you going to get $3.5 billion? No doubt, it must be tough to fundraise after you've already tapped out venture capitalists, private equity firms, mutual funds, hedge funds, Wall Street high-net worth clients, and strategic corporate and other sovereign wealth funds (yes, including from noxious Qatar). But there is another option: Go public. Pretty sure Uber could have raised at least $3.5 billion via an IPO.\"Adding the Equipois product portfolio provides us with core technology to meet customer demand and immediately expands our customer reach from construction to industrial and manufacturing end-users as well.\"\"It's exciting to see our technology go from helping people shoot movies to making peoples' lives better on the job site by helping to reduce fatigue, protect from injuries and increase productivity,\" said Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam\u00ae camera stabilizer as well as the technology incorporated into the Equipois arms. \"It's wonderful to see Ekso Bionics bringing their exoskeleton technology into the industrial construction market for able-bodied workers, much as they've already done for patients in medical rehabilitation.

      "title": "What\u2019s happening in robotics? Five trends to watch",
      "content": "Industrial robots used to be dumb, somewhat inflexible, and mostly blind - but also fast, precise and very efficient.  As the cost of components, sensors and vision systems has been dropping, vision-enabled robots are becoming more prevalent and capable, and the industry is dramatically changing.Those changes can be seen in recent trends in China, investments in and acquisitions of robotic companies, by an analysis of recent startup companies, new and widening application areas for robot use, and technological developments.For the past 50+ years industrial robots have picked the low-hanging fruit of manufacturing by handling the dull, dirty and dangerous tasks. But today, as consumers want more personalized products, and want them faster, and as costs have dropped and executives have pushed for greater productivity through automation, mobile and vision-enabled robots are emerging and being deployed in many new application areas, particularly for SMEs and in logistics, but also in government, agriculture, surveying, construction and healthcare.An analysis of 752 of The Robot Report's global database of robotics-related startup companies shows that 25% of the startups were focused on industrial robotics and 75% address new areas of robotics such as: unmanned aerial, land and underwater devices for filming, marketing, delivery, surveillance, security, surveying, and for the military, science and oil and gas industries (25%); robotics for the agriculture industry (6%); mobile robots as platforms for various uses (7%); personal service bots (3%); professional service bots (7%); medical, surgical and rehabilitation robots (7%); consumer products such as for home cleaning, security, remote presence and entertainment (9%); educational and the hobby market (5%); etc. Support businesses such as AI and software, engineering and design, component manufacturing, 3D printing, vision systems and integrators make up the remainder. More than half of the startups are predominently software based and indicative of the new metric that the hardware component represent less that 1/3 of the overall cost of the product.The industrial robotics sector, whose revenues have represented 75% of the industry's overall sales (as reported by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR)) for the past few years, is forecast by various sources including the IFR to have double-digit compounded annual growth for the remainder of this decade. However, when one studies the figures for the biggest five user-countries, all except China are projecting CAGRs of 6% to 9% while China is expected to exceed 25%. Service robots are also expecting double-digit growth with over 80% of those new companies located in Europe and North America. This explosive growth in service robotics, plus the steady growth in industrial robotics, is suggesting that the next 5-10 years will all be double-digit years for the industry as a whole.Certainly we've all seen some of the reports about this growth and how it will transform work. For example, Oxford Martin School researchers estimate that robotics and artificial intelligence are on track to take over 40% of the US workforce within 15-20 years either as a computer program that will be able to do what many of us do today, or it will be a machine or robot that replicates the physical process of work that we do.With the hope of staying within the world of facts rather than forecasts, I suggest the following five trends as representing drivers propelling forward movement in the robotics industry:China's economy has and continues to transition through all the economic stages of industrialization, urbanization and consumption-driven growth. This movement is both politically stimulated and self-propelling. In the realm of robotics, there are many factors driving growth: a desire to export cars requiring a level of quality that can only be provided by utilizing proven robotic automation methods; multi 5-year governmental incentive plans fostering a home-grown robotics industry; rising wages changing the metrics of human-robot deployment; and general availability of capable factory workers.Thus China is eating up the market both as a buyer and an emerging seller. However, for Chinese companies to fully capture the robotic market within China they will have to shore up missing components that are hard to make and improve quality and precision overall. Components such as end-of-arm tools, speed reducers and harmonic drives will need to be manufactured locally instead of being imported. Many retired Japanese engineers are \"consulting\" to help speed up the process. Chinese venture firms are helping by acquiring international companies, investing in Chinese companies that are attempting to perfect these components, and investing in global companies and reorienting them toward sales and manufacturing in China. One good result: as the industry moves in-country, there will be less blatent thievery, copying and reverse engineering as there has been in the past.China's government has encouraged this in-country market by providing loans and other incentives to companies and to local governments to get them to provide real estate and tax incentives. An industry plan drafted by several ministries, for 2016 to 2020, aims to have 100,000 industrial robots produced annually by domestic companies, with annual sales of 30 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) a year. Meanwhile, more than 40 new robot \u00adindustrial parks have been built or are under construction according to the CRIA, adding that local governments established ~80 policies to support the sector.There have been many reports about the misuse of those funds and the falsification of progress reports. The most recent is the 2015 statistics from the IFR showing that even though China did well, the rate of growth has diminished and projections have been halved. See Industrial robot sales for 2015 set new record in spite of troubles in China. Nevertheless, internalization is ongoing and progressively gaining traction. The bid for half the shares of German robot maker Kuka by a Chinese venture firm is an example. Foxconn's deployment of over 45,000 Foxbots (Foxconn's inhouse brand of robots) in addition to robots from other manufacturers is another.Much has been said about the fast-growing market for collaborative robots. The most current are articles describing car companies replacing old-style industrial robots with a combination of humans and co-bots assisting humans to gain needed flexibility. The websites of Universal Robots (UR) and Rethink Robotics both contain numerous video use-cases in a variety of application areas. Bottom line: this is a viable and growing segment of the robotics industry started by UR but with competition coming from Kuka, ABB and others. The major benefits of these new co-bots are their flexibility, safety, ability to be rapidly deployed, and ease of training. Improvements on each of these benefits will keep pressure on pricing as can be seen by the new low-cost Franka robots and the forthcoming rebranded Roberta robot. Also, at AUTOMATICA, held in Munich this June, every robot manufacturer was touting their safe collaborative robots even when, by any stretch of the imagination, they didn't really have one.Turning co-bots into a commodity may not be good for profits but it is good for businesses, particularly those wanting to take their first step into using robots.In a recent research project on robotics in the agriculture industry, a very cost-sensitive industry, many companies are offering services utilizing robots - instead of selling the robots and having the farmer operate them. Thinning, weeding, spraying, aerial imaging and analytics are examples of the services being offered.This concept of offering services instead of the products used in providing the services is and has been a way to introduce untested products into the marketplace but many enterprising startups are finding economies of scale benefit the service provider. Using drones to capture sensor and camera data and then developing software to analyze that data and translate it into actionable plans has crossed industry boundaries and is being offered not only to ag companies but to oil and gas companies, and NGOs and governments wishing to monitor hard-to-get-to areas. Security companies are beginning to offer RaaS to supplement, augment and replace interior security, etc.There is also a blurring of the line between real robots that perform tasks in physical space and software bots that perform a virtual robot-like service. As a consequence, many companies and service providers are going beyond offering SDKs (software development kits for the making of apps) to opening up their APIs (application protocol interface) so that these new bots can increase their scope and effectiveness and make it easier for their users. Apple just announced that they are opening up their APIs and Amazon has been encouraging developers to take advantage of their Echo and Alexa conversational voice recognition systems. This is helping many new startups offer RaaS using customized Alexa-enabled Echo-like devices. An example is the Belgium startup Zora Robotics which is using Amazon's Echo/Alexa system - and software of their own - in various robots to provide services into the health and eldercare marketplace.Better and lower cost vision systems, particularly low-cost 3D vision, navigation and mobility are enabling a variety of existing and startup companies to offer enhanced material handling methods for factories, warehouses and distribution centers. During the financial crisis, capital expenditures for logistics were put off because existing systems seemed to be able to handle the load. But all that changed as we came back from the crisis and consumers wanted their products faster and warehouses couldn't keep up without massive investments in new tech, new methods and, in many cases, new vendors. Further, these new technologies had to accommodate existing facilities and systems; few companies are building new warehouses; they are instead, changing their methods and systems.Upstarts like Amazon/Kiva, and startups like MiR, Clearpath, Aethon, and Fetch are joining established companies like Swisslog, Grenzebach, FMC and many others as they attempt to bring new tech to help speed up the picking process and the movement of picked items to the packing/shipping stations.The Robot Report reported that in 2015 investment activity, 55 startups received funding totaling $1.32 bn; that 32 acquisitions occured totaling $2.27 bn (for those reporting amounts); and that there was one IPO. 2016, through mid-June, shows 56 startups received $427.5 million; and that 20 acquisitions have happened thus far totaling $4.53 bn (from the 11 reporting amounts involved). If the $3.5 bn Uber funding from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund isn't objected to, and the bid for 49% of Kuka for $2.5 billion is accepted, the figures are much higher.Of particular interest are the investments in Western robotic technology by Chinese investors: the bid by Midea to buy 49% of Kuka, KraussMaffei by ChemChina; Paslin by Wanfeng and Gimatic by Agic Capital. China is definitely on an acquisitions spree.China is also stimulating in-country growth. For example, Tsinghua Holdings, a state-owned fund founded in 2003 by Tsinghua University, kicked off two projects announced at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin. One focuses on helping startups and the other on commercializing scientific findings. The fund will set up 1,000 business incubators in China by 2021 and another 50 in nations including the U.S., the U.K. and Germany. The size of a parent fund will exceed $3 billion.\u201cOur goal is to cultivate 500 startups that are valued at more than $15 million within the next five years. China is still lagging in terms of indigenous and core technologies, and there needs to be some companies to act as pioneers and push ahead with innovation.\u201dAdditional information regarding funding, investments and China can be found here.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Xiaomi, one of China\u2019s star Internet, phone and electronics startups, develops cut-rate but reliable phones and consumer devices and markets them directly to consumers online. Their new HD drone starts at $380, and the 4K video model at $450. Both directly compete - at half the price - with DJI's popular Phantom drones.The new Mi Drone can fly for 27 minutes and has a range of almost 2 miles. DJI drones fly for 23-28 minutes depending on the model. The Mi Drone includes a 360-degree camera that can shoot 4K video, and handheld remote which has the option of attaching a smartphone for a streaming view from the drone. Similar to other Xiaomi products, the company didn\u2019t actually create the Mi Drone itself. Instead it is working with a China-based startup, Flymi, which designed and developed the UAV. Xiaomi is arranging the manufacturing and branding and selling it via its channels, which include its Mi.com online store. Any information on Flymi would be appreciated, particularly a link to their website.Xiaomi recently bought 1,500 technology patents from Microsoft in a deal that may smooth potential legal tangles over intellectual property as Xiaomi begins selling outside of China. The IP covers wireless communications, video, cloud and multimedia technologies. The acquisition came as part of a broader agreement under which Microsoft Office and Skype will come pre-installed on Xiaomi smartphone devices.[Note that many of Xiaomi's executive and technical team previously worked for Microsoft China.]\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "May fundings, acquisitions and IPOs",
      "content": "\nMay was another big month for robotics - 13 companies were funded to the tune of $111 million. Four companies were acquired with 2 of the 4 reporting selling prices totaling $422 million. And that\u2019s without the $5.2 billion bid for Kuka by Chinese Midea, or the pending sale of Google's Boston Dynamics.UPDATE: June 1, 2016: Forbes wrote today that Toyota is in discussions with Google not only for Boston Dynamics but also for Schaft, the Japanese startup that won the DARPA Robotics Challenge -- a two-company sale.The financial pages are lighting up over recent stories about these big-money sales. First there was the $5.2 billion offer by Midea Group, a Chinese appliance manufacturer, for Kuka AG, the Augsburg, Germany-based manufacturer of robots and automated systems. Kuka is one of the Big Four of robot manufacturers. On the day of the bid, Kuka's stock rose from $84/share to $110 where it's stayed since.Then came the announcement by Tech Insider that the Toyota Research Institute is in the final phase of negotiations to acquire Google's robotics company Boston Dynamics, of Big Dog fame. Boston Dynamics spun out of the MIT Leg Lab in 1992 and worked on various military and DARPA funded research projects until Google's Andy Rubin acquired the company along with 8 other robotics companies. Boston Dynamics never quite adapted to Google and Google's push to build a consumer robot, hence their being put on the block in March, 2016.From Forbes, news of a new fund focusing on robotics: Chrysalix VC, a Vancouver, BC venture capital group focused on alternative energy, has partnered with Dutch robotics commercialization center RoboValley to create a new VC fund focused on robotics. The vehicle is targeting E100 million.Below are the fundings, acquisitions, IPOs and failures that actually happened in May:\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Paradigm shift: from Siri to Viv",
      "content": "Artificial intelligence that programs itself on the fly - from the team that developed Siri at SRI and Apple - was demonstrated this week in New York and it quickly performed complex spoken tasks, live and onstage. At the recent TechCrunch Disrupt event, held in New York City May 9-11, Dag Kittlaus unveiled Viv, the new single-source cross-platform voice assistant for the thousands of apps available to us. Viv describes itself as an AI platform that enables developers to distribute their products through an intelligent, conversational interface. Kittlaus expects to offer Viv SDKs to developers in the fall and hopes to fully launch by the end of 2016.In the video below of his 14-minute presentation and demo, with another 10 minutes of Q&A afterwards, one can easily imagine how Viv will soon become integral to the way we use and operate our apps. Viv provides a paradigm shift in the way we effect our daily tasks -- the very shift that others are attempting to provide in the form of personal assistants. It is a breakthrough accomplishment in providing a single conversational user interface (UI) to recognize our words, determine our intent, and then write code to effect that intent. As a side benefit, the video is very informative about the process of AI. [Forward to 4:00 and watch for 10 minutes just to see the demos and skip the intro and Q&A.]Jibo, Pepper, Alexa, Duer, Cortana, Google, Watson and many others (startups are popping up every few days) are all in various stages of presenting and bringing to market their versions of personal assistants - some physical, others virtual.But the Viv demo - done live - was speedier than any and Kittlaus explained why: because as more and more apps become available, and as more and more users want to use some of those apps, a personal assistant must scale to handle all those functions and the larger the scale, the more complex it becomes, the more lines of code that must be written, and it ultimately will slow down. Conversely Viv has a dynamic program generator that writes solution-based code from the intent of the user. In other words, Viv's AI parses through the words you say to determine intent and then writes only the software that meets the specific task requested and does it quickly. The video also shows, but doesn't detail, how Viv determines intent (goals) from the words. It breaks down the conversation into goals and values within thereby instructing the dynamic program generator which apps are required and what the parameters are for those apps.Is Viv going to eliminate Google as the middleman? Kittlaus says that search isn't going anywhere but as Viv and other new AI assistants become more capable and become the primary resource for users, people really won't want to go back to the old way.Siri, co-founded by SRI's Dag Kittlaus and Adam Cheyer and by Tom Gruber, was spun-out from the SRI International Artificial Intelligence Center and acquired by Apple for $200 million in 2010. Kittlaus left Apple in 2011; Cheyer left in 2012.Personal assistants are all about simplifying the process of performing daily tasks. They are attempting to be what you would expect of a knowledgeable executive assistant working alongside to maximize your productivity and minimize your involvement, a person who really knows you and doesn't need you to reexplain things over and over. The list of vendors is impressive: Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, Baidu, Microsoft, Apple, SoftBank, all the car companies, many large consumer product providers and smaller companies like Jibo. To date, none have achieved that sweet spot where end users are fully satisfied.The holdup has been the software, the need for extensive coding, and the ability to identify \"intent\" from sounds recognized as words. The breakthrough technology that Viv is offering is a way to change the way programmers work with computers and developers offer their products. Programmers will no longer have to instruct step-by-step procedures in rigid code, but instead they'll just have to describe the process and intent and the AI will develop the code - it will write the programs needed on the fly.  And developers will just need to add Viv as their conversational UI.[Viv uses Nuance for voice recognition. Nuance is a member of the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index (of which I am a Co-founder).\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "May and June offer two important trade shows and conferences for professional and personal service robotics: Innorobo, held in Paris May 24-26 and AUTOMATICA, held June 21-24 in Munich.Innorobo, which began as a regional show in Lyon, France, has become a steady and growing conference and show focusing on service robotics, has 100 exhibitors, and has changed its venue to Paris to handle that growth. Although far smaller than AUTOMATICA, Innorobo is highly focused on service robotics, startups and disruptive technological innovations -- on social robots, mobile robots, AI and distributed intelligence for robotics, remote presence, commercial drones, and collaborative robotics.AUTOMATICA, is a massive trade fair for automation and mechatronics with a special focus on professional service robotics. Over 800 exhibitors in an immense exhibition space, a 150-presentation symposium on robotics with speakers from both industry and science, and focused on covering service robotics, man-robot collaboration, machine vision, even a Makeathon competition \u2014 everything related to robotics and automation. Only happens every other year -- and this is the year!Excerpted liberally from The Robolution: Are We Walking the Talk? by Catherine Simon, Innorobo founder, President and CEO.Wikipedia described robotics as a \u201cGeneral Purpose Technology,\u201d a GPT, which can effect an entire economy and has the potential to radically change society through its impact on pre-existing economic and social structures. The examples of GPTs given are the steam engine, electricity, the automobile and, of course, the Internet.It is clear that robotics technologies provide potential solutions to our major societal challenges. Precision agriculture is helping to save our planet, and robotics technologies applied to the energy, recycling and waste management sectors can transform the way we consume natural resources by optimizing our use and distributing it based on real needs. Medical and healthcare robotics can eliminate the word \u201cdisability\u201d from our vocabulary and give new autonomy to our elderly citizens. The list goes on and on. In industry, do we really need to produce more at a lower cost or rather give humans back a sense of pride in their profession and know-how while making their work less physically demanding?While technology is a means, it is not there to give us meaning. Robotics technologies are going to continue to advance with, if we believe Moore\u2019s Law, an \u201cinflection point\u201d in the next 10 to 20 years, followed by rapid progress, and with the aim to improve the lives of all citizens while preserving our planet for sustainable humanity.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Global and iRobot floor cleaning market",
      "content": "iRobot recently divested its defense division so that it could focus on consumer and mobility products. Red Mountain Capital, a hedge fund that owns ~6% of iRobot stock wants to place two people on the iRobot board to effect some change.Red Mountain Capital has forced iRobot into a battle over management direction, a fight described in detail in a story by Jon Chesto of The Boston Globe: IRobot CEO faces what could be his biggest test: a heated proxy battle over company\u2019s future.Red Mountain considers itself to be an activist shareholder - and wants to play a more direct role in how iRobot is run, how iRobot funds are allocated to R&D, how expenses are controlled, and how much is returned to shareholders. iRobot thinks it is successfully handling strategic planning, product development, return on equity, and prudent manufacturing operations without adding extra financial advice from non-industry people to the mix.The Globe article, describing iRobot's planning for the future, describes iRobot's Venture Group and their investments in future companies within the mobility, consumer and home marketplaces - all areas where iRobot has expertise. One investment is particularly interesting and offers the prospect of much growth for iRobot as well as the startup: 6 River Systems, a Massachusetts startup comprised of ex-Kiva Systems execs. 6 River is providing a mobile robot solution for material handling in warehouses, factories and distribution centers. It's a big marketplace particularly since Amazon has taken the Kiva technology in-house with the consequence that new vendors (such as 6 River) are scrambling to fill the void.In the Boston Globe article I was quoted as summarizing the iRobot / Red Mountain proxy fight as follows:\u201cFrom time to time, any company really can use a shake-up. But you can shake up the company [iRobot] just by talking to Colin,\u201d Tobe said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to put two hedge-fund, money-type people on the board.\u201dFrom the chart above one can see that iRobot's share of the global robot floor cleaning market is 63% of units and 40% of revenue, and shows year-over-year gains of 8.3% for units and 9.3% for revenue.The robot segment of the overall home vacuum cleaner market has also been growing. Colin Angle, iRobot co-founder, Chairman and CEO, used this chart in a 2014 presentation:Thus one can see that robotic vacuum sales are becomming more popular but at a lower growth rate than the general vacuum market growth rate. And from Angle's presentation slide, it's clear that although iRobot has a goodly share of the market, their revenue could be higher and their overall capture rate is going down instead up.The following three research reports vary widely but all show double-digit growth within the robotic sector of the global home vacuum market.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "GM\u2019s purchase of Cruise fuels interest in self-driving car kits",
      "content": "Most car companies are remaking themselves into tech startups as they move toward offering fully autonomous self-driving vehicles. Yet thousands of tractors already use self-driving kits as do hundreds of tugs, lifts and trucks. Self-driving aftermarket kits are beginning to be offered in multiple markets. What's going on?Cruise Automation just got acquired by GM for $1 billion. Up until now Cruise was known as the developer of a $16,000 aftermarket kit to turn select cars into self-driving cars. Does GM want to supplement their parts business with self-driving kits? Or did they spend all that money to acquire talent?Cruise Automation isn't the only kit developer: Comma.ai promises a $1,000 kit by the end of this year and just got a $3.1 million seed round of funding; Perrone Robotics is already selling a high-end kit for R&D and testing with funding from DARPA and the IIHS. Other companies are listed below. What's going on? Are aftermarket kits really that much in demand? Media today seems most focused on suggesting that the industry is quickly moving toward preventing crashes from ever occuring instead of just protecting occupants from crashes even though there are many other reasons for self-driving (eg, fuel efficiency, lowering carbon emissions, enabling safe transportion for the elderly, and improving traffic congestion).From an interview in Wired of Andrew Ng, Chief Scientist of Baidu; and Chairman and Co-Founder of Coursera.I think self-driving cars are a little further out than most people think. There\u2019s a debate about which one of two universes we\u2019re in. In the first universe it\u2019s an incremental path to self-driving cars, meaning you have cruise control, adaptive cruise control, then self-driving cars only on the highways, and you keep adding stuff until 20 years from now you have a self-driving car. In universe two you have one organization, maybe Carnegie Mellon or Google, that invents a self-driving car and bam! You have self-driving cars. It wasn\u2019t available Tuesday but it\u2019s on sale on Wednesday.I\u2019m in universe one. I think there\u2019s a lot of confusion about how easy it is to do self-driving cars. There\u2019s a big difference between being able to drive a thousand miles, versus being able to drive anywhere. And it turns out that machine-learning technology is good at pushing performance from 90 to 99 percent accuracy. But it\u2019s challenging to get to four nines (99.99 percent).As car companies move in the direction of providing self-driving cars, most have proprietary roadmaps and big needs for software and other engineering talent. They have all set up research facilities in Silicon Valley and throughout academia. The Wall Street Journal mapped car company locations in Silicon Valley (shown below) which attests to their proliferation. Not included on this map are the new tech startups profiled in this article.Because the auto industry is so much larger and visible to the consumer public, the remainder of this article will focus on self-driving kits and other software and AI offered to the auto, transportation and trucking industries, as well as to the consumer aftermarket.Perhaps the Deere tractor example applies to cars. Deere has had self-driving, autonomous, cab-less concept tractors such as the one shown on the right available for discussion and possible sale but thus far they haven't replaced the self-driving kits which they have been selling for 15 years. Farmers want the air-conditioned and cushioned cabin on their tractors to house all the monitors and other computer and automation technologies for the implements the tractors are towing. They want to remain in charge and the cab has become the hub of computerized farm automation. They say they are waiting for the right time - when fully autonomous tractor systems provide all the services they want and need. And that time is far off in the future.Maybe car drivers want to remain in charge but are willing to have fun experimenting with low-cost partial self-driving kits or incremental add-on features on new cars until the time - far off in the future - when fully trustworthy autonomous self-driving vehicles take over the transportation marketplace. Maybe the public isn't ready yet to fully trust cars, trucks and buses without drivers. Perhaps self-driving kits are an interim step along the way. \u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

Today single-purpose devices, combining sensors with software and data analytics components, have the potential to radically automate the physical world around us -- eliminating \"dirty, dull & dangerous\" tasks from our lives and, thus, realizing the ultimate purpose of robotics. The investment focus of the new fund reflects this vision, as Grishin Robotics looks to fund both hardware & software companies, driven by the six pillars of the Hardware Revolution -- (1) cheaper components, (2) ubiquitous connectivity, (3) smartphone penetration, (4) 3D printing, (5) disruption of supply chain and (6) crowdfunding. By 2020, total value of the markets driven by these changes, is estimated to reach $1 trillion.The new fund will be primarily focused on Series A & B deals, with a certain amount of capital reserved for seed and later-stage opportunities -- such as Ring, a web-based video doorbell consumer product, whose Series C round was the first investment from the new fund. Grishin Robotics is looking to expand its B2B focus as well as B2C, and will allocate up to $10 million over the lifecycle of portfolio startup companies.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "The technology gap left by Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Kiva Systems",
      "content": "In March 2012, in an effort to make their distribution centers (DCs) as efficient as possible, Amazon acquired Kiva Systems for $775 million and almost immediately took them inhouse.UPDATED 4/19/2016 to add Swisslog and Grenzebach as fulfillment systems providersThere was confusion after the acquisition whether Kiva would continue providing DCs with Kiva robots. Although Kiva said that they would continue selling their technology to other retailers it soon became clear that Amazon was taking all Kiva's production and that, at some future date, Kiva would stop supporting their existing client base and focus entirely on Amazon - which happened in April 2015 when Amazon renamed Kiva to Amazon Robotics and encouraged prospective users of Kiva technology to let Amazon Robotics and Amazon Services provide fulfillment within Amazon warehouses using Amazon robots.Consequently there has been a scramble of new providers to fill the void left by Kiva's technology, warehouse software systems and robots being removed from the marketplace. Many of these startups were showing their robotic systems at MODEX 2016 held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta. MODEX is a big material handling equipment, technology and systems show with 850 exhibitors, 250,000 sq ft (23,225 sq mt) of expo space, 100 informational seminars and over 25,000 attendees.Kiva's robots and inventory management system were breakthrough technologies in 2011 and 2012 enabling items that were to be shipped to be brought to the packer near the truck door instead of the more traditional method of the picker/packer going out into the warehouse, picking the goods, and returning to pack and ship them. At the time Kiva started operations, robotic picking was still a premature science, consequently Kiva focused on managing the rest of the process: receiving, depalletizing and storing items and bringing dynamically-stored shelves containing ordered items to the picker/packer to pick, pack and ship while the Kiva robot returned the shelves to the most appropriate area in a free-form dynamic warehouse and autonomously went off to bring the next shelf to another picker/packer.[To read the details about how a Kiva robot is made, click here.]Although vision systems and grasping technologies have improved since then, they still aren't fast and flexible enough to replace humans so, instead, most new systems attempt to augment humans by reducing what they have to carry and the distances they have to travel to get the items that were ordered.Mobile platform systems are designed to work across multiple environments - DCs, warehouses, factories - and are autonomous mobile platforms that can be fitted with special-purpose payloads such as for receiving, restocking, inventory, moving material from work cell to work cell, picking, supporting human pickers, packing and palletizing. Many vendors have provided AGVs, carts, lifts and tows, and have done so for many years. The older versions of these systems use markings, tapes, beacons, sensors and other things on the floors and ceilings to provide location information. Newer systems use the latest 3D vision systems, collision avoidance and mapping software to easily enable autonomous point-to-point navigation.Seegrid calls today's vision guided vehicles the next generation of AGVs. Many vendors have, for years, provided material handling AGVs used to tow carts and pallets around warehouses, hospitals and factories. They depend upon beacons or floor and wall markings for their navigation and are efficient but klutzy.Erik Nieves, who previously was Director of Technology for US Yaskawa Motoman and is now in stealth mode with his startup Plus One Robotics, said:Armed with lower-cost LiDARs and Kinnect-like infrared 3D camera systems, new players like Aethon and Seegrid entered the market with new capabilities - including being able to autonomously unload containers: vision guided robotic lifts, tugs and platforms.As an aside, Seegrid recently held a contest to acknowledge journalists covering the materials handling industry and they awarded The Robot Report third place at an Awards Celebration event held after hours at MODEX in Atlanta. First place went to John Hitch, a staff writer at New Equipment Digest; second place went to Bob Trebilcock, Exec Editor at Modern Materials Handling.

The divestiture ends iRobot's dual focus on the military and consumer markets and ends a multi-year revenue slide in the defense division. The sale was a strategically planned transition as the Iraq and Afghanistan wars wound down.Colin Angle, iRobot Chairman and CEO, said: \"In the spring of 2014, we engaged Blackstone Advisory Partners LP, now known as PJT Partners, to review strategic alternatives for our Defense and Security business. After a thorough and deliberate process, we've concluded the sale of the business to Arlington Capital Partners will maximize shareholder value by allowing us to focus on our much larger Home segment.Earlier this month iRobot launched the Braava Jet Mopping Robot to add to their wet floor care business and to generate a new revenue stream beyond the Roomba line of vacuum products. The new robot is small -- about 6\" square and 3\" high -- with a nifty carrying handle -- and focused on cleaning hardwood floors and tight spaces by dry mopping, damp mopping (uses 60% of water compared to wet mode), and wet mopping. Each mode has a unique pad easily snapped onto the bottom of the robot (and snapped off over the trash bin) and identified by the robot as to which of the three functions it is to perform. The new little robot's best feature, however, is its low price: $199.The Braava Jet is to be marketed heavily in China where the more expensive previous version of the Braava floor cleaner did quite well in year-over-year sales. In fact, according to CEO Colin Angle in an analysts financial call, said that growth in China was more than 70% year over year in 2015, driven primarily by the successful adoption of previous Braava models given predominately hard floor surfaces in the region. Hence the new lower-priced device is expected to be ideal in both the China and American markets.In a recent letter to shareholders iRobot described its shift in focus toward the high-growth home robot business and by investing in projects that show the greatest promise for outsized returns.iRobot is doing that with its existing and new products but also through its venture arm, iRobot Ventures, which just invested in 6 River Systems, a Boston-based startup of ex-Kiva executives developing fulfillment automation for e-commerce and retail operations. iRobot Ventures previously invested in Petnet, a smart feeder for cats and dogs, and Paracosm, a 3D vision and mapping technology company.As an aside, Red Mountain Capital Partners, a VC which owns 6.1% of iRobot shares, and that invests in undervalued small cap companies and attempts to enhance and realize shareholder value through active ownership, is attempting to add two board members to the iRobot board at the upcoming stockholders meeting. Throughout our nearly year-long engagement with iRobot, it has become clear that the Board will only take action in reaction to significant shareholder pressure. As such, we have nominated individuals who are highly qualified and would bring a much needed shareholder voice to the boardroom. Red Mountain has consistently called for improved Board oversight with respect to the Company\u2019s allocation of capital, cost management, return on invested capital and corporate governance policies,\u201d said Willem Mesdag, Managing Partner of Red Mountain.In the letter to shareholders, iRobot does not recommend these two board members but another two of it's picking while citing that iRobot has delivered total shareholder return of 66% over the past three years compared to 59% for peers and 50% for S&P 500 companies. \u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Forget about Google and Boston Dynamics. This week the real news is that GM acquired small San Francisco based startup Cruise Automation for the rumored sum of more than $1B US, according to Fortune. Robotics has its first unicorn!Note: This article was first posted on Robohub.org and is republished with permission.For the last 3 years, San Francisco startup Cruise Automation has been working on an \u2018after market\u2019 kit to make vehicles self driving. Cruise has previously raised over $18 million in venture funding, on a post-money $90 million valuation. Investors include YCombinator, Spark Capital, Maven Ventures and Founder Collective.Apparently Cruise was in discussion with GM about their next venture round which turned into an acquisition. It would seem that GM is interested less in the after market kit and more in integrating the Cruise team into GM\u2019s core technology development.According to the press release, Cruise will operate as an independent unit within GM\u2019s recently formed Autonomous Vehicle Development Team led by Doug Parks, GM vice president of autonomous technology and vehicle execution, and will continue to be based in San Francisco, where Cruise has been testing its technology in a challenging city environment.\u201cCruise provides our company with a unique technology advantage that is unmatched in our industry. We intend to invest significantly to further grow the talent base and capabilities already established by the Cruise team.\u201d said Mark Reuss, GM executive vice president, Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain.\u201cGM\u2019s commitment to autonomous vehicles is inspiring, deliberate, and completely in line with our vision to make transportation safer and more accessible,\u201d said Kyle Vogt, founder of Cruise Automation. \u201cWe are excited to be partnering with GM and believe this is a ground-breaking and necessary step toward rapidly commercializing autonomous vehicle technology.\u201dAccording to the press release, the acquisition of Cruise is GM\u2019s latest step toward its goal of redefining the future of personal mobility. Since the beginning of the year, GM has entered into a strategic alliance with ride-sharing company Lyft; formed Maven, its personal mobility brand for car-sharing fleets in many U.S. cities, and established a separate unit for autonomous vehicle development.But really, robotics has finally reached the tipping point. In 2014, Silicon Valley Robotics announced that over $1 billion had been invested in robotics in the last 5 years, 2009 to 2014. In 2015, over $1 billion was invested in robotics in a 12 month period, according to Hizook and The Robot Report. And in 2016, over $1 billion has been invested in one single robotics startup, Cruise Automation.Robotics has its first real unicorn. [To be fair, Intuitive Surgical, founded in 1995 and IPO'd in 2000 has a market value of $21.5 billion. But the M&A term \"unicorn\" wasn't coined back then.]Note: This article was first posted on Robohub.org and is republished with permission.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportRead more \u00bb",

      "title": "Indego joins Ekso with FDA exoskeleton approvals",
      "content": "Parker's Indego exoskeleton received FDA clearance after completing a large clinical trial in the U.S. The study consisted of 1,200+ sessions where participants were able to walk safely on several in- and outdoor surfaces using the exoskeleton.Indego is the result of 10 years of development by engineers at Vanderbilt University funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. In 2012 it was licensed to Parker Hannifin (recently renamed to just Parker) for commercialization and marketing, and is an external skeleton that works by strapping it around the patient's torso; legs are also strapped with supports from the hips to the knees and from the knees to the feet. Computer-controlled motors act as knee and hip joints. Patients use forearm crutches to keep their balance.The international group of exoskeleton providers with various FDA or CE certifications is growing and includes Ekso in the US, Cyberdyne in the EU and Japan, ExoAtlet from Russia, and Israel's ReWalk. Other providers are in the process of getting those approvals or developing commercial versions of their products and include:Many of these startups are seeking insurance policy and coverage from the related healthcare insurers and agencies in addition to CE and FDA approvals for their devices. Japan's Health Ministry has approved Cyberdyne's HAL exo suit as a medical device which enables it to be paid for by the public health insurance system. Cyberdyne has announced plans to submit a request to the health ministry to make this possible. FDA and CE approvals help insurance review boards rule regarding whether to cover exoskeletons. ReWalk was the first in the US to receive workman's compensation coverage after multiple challenges and reviews. But general health insurance coverage has been slow to approve these new devices either for personal use or even for rehab sessions prescribed by a doctor. In February of this year, in what could be a major turning point for people with spinal cord injuries, a medical review board ruled that a health insurance provider is obligated to provide coverage and reimbursement for a $69,500 ReWalk robotic exoskeleton. The unnamed health plan initially denied coverage, but after an independent review board dug into the beneficiary\u2019s case and the current state of exoskeleton technology, it ruled that the exoskeleton was \u201cmedically necessary.\u201dThe review board determined that the exoskeleton was necessary because it allowed the patient to walk. This ruling implies that walking is not a luxury for patients with spinal injuries, but a right\u2014and that if the technology exists and is mechanically sound, insurance companies must cover them.ReWalk CEO Larry Jasinski was pleased by the decision, stating in a press release, \"Health benefit providers have historically been hesitant to acknowledge the clinical benefits in their case assessments. This ruling, and subsequent coverage and reimbursement, will help ReWalk in our efforts to facilitate greater patient access to the device.\"\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Collaborative robots are broadening their marketplaces",
      "content": "Universal Robots, the Danish manufacturer of a line of collaborative robots (also called \"co-bots\"), recently published financial statements which provide valuable insights into the growth potential of collaborative robots.At present, sales of collaborative robots represent just 5% of the overall robot market. The collaborative robotics sector, according to multiple pay-for research reports, is expected to increase roughly tenfold between 2015 and 2020, reaching over $1 billion from approximately $95 million in 2014. In financial statements released in February, Universal Robots (UR) reported 2015 revenue of $61.44 million, a 91% increase over 2014, and net profit of $9.6 million before taxes for the year, up 122% over 2014. Unit sales, which began in 2009, have risen at around 75% each year to 3,500 in 2015. At year's end, UR employed 150 in Denmark and another 50 worldwide, had 7,000 robots at work in the field, and had a global network of integrators and distributors totaling more than 200.Enrico Krog Iversen, UR's CEO, said he hopes that 2016 sales will exceed 90% and that UR had moved into larger space in 2014 to handle this level of growth. The new facility has a capacity of 33,000 units per year. At just 75% growth each year, as can be seen in the chart above, UR will hit their plant capacity by the end of 2019!Last year Universal Robots sold to Massachusetts-based Teradyne, a publicly-traded provider of electronic testing equipment, for $285 million in cash and $65 million in options. Teradyne, with over 3,900 employees and a product line that doesn't include anything robotic, has a market value of $4.37 billion. Mark Jagiela, President and CEO, said of the acquisition:In regards to the acquisition, Iversen said that Teradyne was opening doors to their customers in the electronics industry which are prime prospects for UR co-bots. Regarding competition, Iversen said, \"Our main competitor is manual labor.\" Stated another way, within the SME community, a big holdup is educating managers, engineers and workers regarding the value, opportunity, employee performance improvement and quick ROI of deploying co-bots as worker assistants. As this educational process progresses and succeeds, co-bot sales will surely follow.As ambitious as UR's fast growth figures and forecasted future sales are, they represent just one co-bot competitor serving millions of SMEs. They don't reflect what the Top 8 robot companies - Fanuc, Yaskawa, ABB, Kawasaki, Nachi, Kuka, Denso, Epson and Adept - have in store. Because each of these companies is publicly held, they are limited in what they can say about the future and don't provide any information about their plans relating to the introduction and marketing of their brand of co-bots. We do know that ABB has a two-armed robot named YuMi (some of which are installed at various Mercedes Benz factories) and a one-armed as-yet unnamed robot which they acquired from gomTec that will be rebranded and launched later this year; Fanuc recently introduced a heavy-lifting co-bot; Kuka has an elegant lightweight but very expensive co-bot; and each of the other vendors (except Yaskawa), have begun to offer various co-bots. Consequently the unit sales forecast in the chart above doesn't reflect any effect from the Top 8 companies.Other co-bots - particularly those that add mobility to their capabilities - are creating new markets for guides, kiosks, store assistants, inventory takers, warehouse and distribution center \"gofors\", and countless other applications including mobile personal assistants such as the SoftBank Pepper robot. Many pay-for research reports suggest that these types of co-bots will grow at around 30% annually - a far cry from UR's growth these past few years - but substantial nonetheless. The SoftBank Robotics Group is producing 1,000 Pepper robots every month and plans to double that number when they begin sales later this year into China.The European robotics initiative for strengthening the competitiveness of SMEs in manufacturing, called SME Robot, was funded by the EU FP6 (Framework Programme 6) and started in March, 2005 (and extended in a successor project in FP7 to June of this year). It was chartered to determine ways to keep labor from being sent offshore to lower labor-cost countries and focused on the large number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at threat of offshoring. [SMEs are defined as manufacturing companies having less than 500 employees. The number of SMEs worldwide is estimated to be 6 million.] The thesis was that if you empowered SME employees with robotic tools, the SME company would become more cost efficient and competitive and therefore not have to be off-shored. Thus the initial marketplace for co-bots was to SMEs.In a parallel development in America beginning in 2008, Rodney Brooks founded Rethink Robotics and began educating American SMEs about the benefits of the Baxter line of robots he was developing. It\u2019s rare that one man can influence a whole universe of stakeholders. But from his network of MIT students and extensive speaking engagements to his various entrepreneurial activities, he has informed and charmed his vision of what robots can do and how people and corporations can benefit. Timing, of course, played a role as have the rapid changes and lowered costs of new sensors and robotic technologies. But throughout, Rod Brooks has defined the need and sold the sizzle of collaborative robots. At first, his product, the Baxter robot, wasn\u2019t able to fulfill his promises. Universal Robots\u2019 robots, however, did \u2013 and their sales took off while Baxter\u2019s stayed minimal. Last year Rethink did a major software upgrade and added a new one-armed robot called Sawyer. Reviews have been favorable for both changes and it appears that Rethink has finally become a real competitor in the co-bots marketplace. (See below for more about Rethink).BMW, which utilizes ~7,500 industrial robots in their factories around the world experimented with UR co-bots last year with significant results. In a human-machine study conducted by an MIT professor, it was shown that teams made of humans and robots collaborating efficiently can be more productive than teams made of either humans or robots alone. They also found that they could increase productivity and also reduce ergonomically challenging tasks done by humans which increased morale and empowered workers with these easily programmed collaborative robots. A BMW spokesman said that, based on the success of these tests, he could foresee doubling or even tripling the number of robots in BMW factories.When I asked UR's Iversen whether he had received a multi-thousand purchase order from BMW subsequent to their tests, he playfully responded by saying, \"BMW is a strong partner.\"Again, in a parallel development at a Mercedes Benz factory in Germany, in an effort to halve the 61 hours it takes to produce a car, Mercedes is shifting to what it calls \u201crobot farming\u201d - equipping workers with an array of smaller, lighter machines and co-bots. Customization is key to Mercedes' marketing and buyers are choosing an ever-increasing array of options causing a need for flexibility not presently available from legacy robots. Humans (and their co-bots) are being added to provide that needed flexibility. While robots won\u2019t completely disappear, they\u2019ll increasingly be smaller and more flexible and operate in conjunction with human workers rather than be off working behind safety fences. \u201cWe\u2019re moving away from trying to maximize automation with people taking a bigger part in industrial processes again,\u201d said Markus Schaefer, Mercedes' head of production. \u201cWe need to be flexible.\u201d This trend toward adding humans augmented with co-bots back into the auto assembly process because of their ability to be more flexible than big industrial robots is being felt in studies at many of the car companies in Germany, Sweden and the UK. But it also broadens the co-bot marketplace by adding factories with more than 500 employees.Rethink has recently been developing an international distribution and integrator network for it's Baxter and Sawyer robots. Along with Sumitomo Corp for Japan and Shanghai Electric for Eastern China, Rethink is working with startup Hunan Cothink Robotics Technology for Northern and Southern China. Cothink will have a capability to integrate, test and install up to 2,000 robots annually. Asia, and particularly China, are integral to Rethink Robotics global expansion plan.Other one- or two-armed co-bot manufacturers include MRK-System GmbH, F&P Personal Robotics, Bosch, MABI Robotic, Smokie Robotics and Kawada Industries. The list of mobile co-bot providers is much more extensive and includes (to mention just a few) companies like Amazon, Fetch, Grey Orange, Harvest Automation, MetraLabs, and many others. These companies, and their primary applications, will be the subject of a future article.There's no doubt that the collaborative robot marketplace will be growing exponentially over the next few years - with UR leading the pack - and price, safety, flexibility and ease of programming being the key determinents as to which vendor(s) are chosen. \u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "It's too early to tell whether the record-breaking pace of 2015 fundings for robotic startups and the number of acquisitions will carry over into 2016, nevertheless here are the transactions that happened in February:5D Robotics raised $5.5 million in a seed round from private investors to enable the development of their commercial equipment automation business efforts which include mapping, inspection and providing vision and mobility systems for industrial heavy equipment. 5D Robotics is also a provider of centimeter level UWB radios and mobile positioning systems for defense applications.MicaSense raised $7.4 million from Parrot (which had previously invested $2M in 2014). MicaSense is launching a new multispectral camera (manufactured by Parrot) that utilizes MicaSense's ATLAS software platform for processing, management, presentation and analytics of sensor data and fits on any fixed-wing or multirotor drone. The new device, Sequoia, weighs only 100+ grams and has four narrowband filters (red, green, red edge and near infrared) for analyzing crop health for precision agriculture.Sky-Futures got $5.7 million in a series A funding from the Bristow Group and MMC Ventures. Sky-Futures is a drone inspection service for the oil and gas industry. Bristow Group President and CEO Jonathan Baliff said:Through our partnership, we will collaborate with Sky-Futures and its leading safety culture, operational integration, and analysis technology to capitalize beyond the growing need for global UAV inspection services in oil and gas to other industries, including search and rescue.Titan Medical made a public stock offering that netted $12 million. Titan Medical is a Canadian company developing a surgeon-controlled robotic surgical system for minimally invasive surgery. Their SPORT\u2122 Surgical System is being designed to expand robotic surgery into both simple and complex areas of surgical specialties and procedures that are currently under-serviced.iRobot sold off it's Defense Division for $45 million to Arlington Capital Partners, a government regulated sectors and verticals VC who will help fund and manage the new privately-held and as-yet unnamed spin-off. iRobot is a member of the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index (of which I am Co-founder). The new standalone company will focus entirely on the needs of defense, public safety and security. Existing iRobot management and staff will move over to the new company which will remain in Bedford, MA.Deveron UAS (previously Deveron Resources, a Canadian mineral exploration company) acquired Eagle Scout Imaging, an agricultural UAS data provider, for an undisclosed amount with the goal of renaming and rebranding Eagle Scout Imaging and Deveron Resources into Deveron UAS, a provider of aerial data to farmers.\u201cWe are very excited to be moving in this new direction,\u201d comments David Macmillan, Deveron\u2019s director and vice president of corporate development. \u201cOur work over the past year suggests enormous investment opportunities exist across multiple verticals where UAS technology can be applied. We have identified a number of potential acquisition and joint venture possibilities in this area, and we are pleased to be working with Eagle Scout to build the premier Canadian precision UAS agricultural brand.\u201dBluefin Robotics was acquired by the Mission Systems unit of General Dynamics for an undisclosed amount. Bluefin is a Massachusetts-based developer of autonomous undersea robots used for mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance applications for the DoD. \"Bluefin's advanced underwater technologies and products are perfectly aligned with our expertise in undersea system integration,\" said Chris Marzilli, president of General Dynamics Mission Systems. \"\u201cWe have long specialized in many of the technologies that are making UUVs increasingly effective, and have strong credentials integrating UUVs into naval platforms.

      "content": "In a TV spectacle celebrating the Chinese New Year and seen by more than 640 million viewers, 540 Chinese-made robots danced in time to a song sung by a Chinese superstar while 29 neon-colored drones flew in unison overhead.To give you a point of comparison, 115 million Americans watched the Super Bowl; 640 million viewers watched the Spring Festival Gala celebration of Chinese New Year. Another factoid, Intel just won a Guiness World Record for having 100 flying drones fly and show their colored lights in sync with an orchestra playing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, compared to 540 UBTECH Alpha1 robots performing synchronized dancing. If you watch the whole 1-1/2 hour extravaganza, you can see a level of consumerism and commercialism that may be surprising. Certainly that consumerism is showing up in demand for small household products and robots - robots that suggest they can provide a wealth of services and applications:UBTECH used their Alpha1 robot for the CCTV Chinese New Year show. On their website they are showing their new Alpha2 - in English - in a revealing video.This Chinese New Year's inclusion of robots and drones - and Japan's focus on showcasing robots and robotics for their Olympics in 2020 - shows their interest in human-like robots and this interest translates into consumer demand. UBTECH and many other startups in China and elsewhere are focusing on taking advantage of that Asian interest with products such as the Alpha robot and the SoftBank Pepper robot. Alpha is smaller than Pepper but they both interact using human speech and are geared to home and social use. Alpha, Buddy, Jibo and Pepper are all entering the marketplace this year and we will see how they fare after a few months of user experience. Certainly Alpha is a Chinese competitor to the success of Pepper.Let the games begin!\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Alpha Smart Technologies, a newly launched $304 million initiative aimed at developing and marketing a range of smart devices and robots, has partnered with Blue Frog Robotics and their Buddy robot, and Turing Robot and their AI robot operating system.Buddy is the cute little robot from French startup Blue Frog Robotics. Turing Robot is a Chinese software developer well along the way to providing a robot operating system enabling interactive communication in Chinese between humans, robots and smart devices. Turing's system also has an SDK and API system for app developers.Combining the two (Blue Frog and Turing Robot) into a new wholly-owned entity, Alpha Smart Technologies, is Guangdong Alpha Animation and Culture Company (Alpha), one of the world's largest developers of animation and toys. Alpha is projecting sales of more than one million smart watches and robots by the end of 2016 with a major focus on China's K-12 group of children.Rodolphe Hasselvander, CEO of Blue Frog Robotics, said:This partnership will help us to reach the Chinese market.

Robots such as Buddy, and the proliferation of mobile robot butlers, guides and kiosks, promise to recognize your voice and face and help you plan your calendar, provide reminders, take pictures of special moments, text, call and videoconference, order fast food, keep watch on your house or office, read recipes, play games, read emotions and interact accordingly, and the list goes on. They are attempting to be analogous to a sharp administrative assistant that knows your schedule, contacts and interests and engages with you about them, helping you stay informed, connected and active.Certainly social, humanoid and mobile robots are crowd pleasers. Ten years ago PopSci reporter Tim Hornyak wrote \"Loving the Machine,\" a book about Asia's long-time fascination with robots. His insights still appear to be true: there really is an unusual affinity for human-like robotic things \u2014 which is why so much money is flowing to adapt these new social robots to quickly speak Chinese and Japanese (in addition to English) and to provide localized apps for their software stores.This recent article is relevant: 2016 will be a pivotal year for this type of robot.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

Other super-large exhibition spaces were for Samsung (the absolute biggest), LG, Nikon, Canon, Panasonic, Sony, Mercedes, Intel and Qualcomm.The most notable companies NOT exhibiting were Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google and IBM although most had hospitality suites and/or meeting rooms for their ad teams to meet with clients who produced consumer electronic products and IBM's CEO was one of the keynote presenters (see below).In a NY Times article, the serious side of the CES spectacle was highlighted: \"A lot of business gets done at CES, often away from the show floor, in the labyrinthine warrens of meeting rooms across the Las Vegas Strip.\"Very true. Even for companies that didn't exhibit like Twitter and IBM, they all had quiet spaces to demonstrate products, talk pricing and agreements, and generally have time and space for one-on-ones with customers and prospects. Although IBM is no longer in the consumer products business they had a large meeting room set aside for their customers who were. Twitter created a miniature city in two large ballrooms at one of the hotels. It had shops, restaurants, a bar, theater and an outdoor park. Each was a meeting area for Twitter's ad sales team to meet and greet customers.There were more than 25 press conferences held at the show. Many were announcing additional products to an existing product line. A few described new products. And some, like Toyota and Intel, provided pertinent information about profound changes about to happen.Toyota held a press conference led by Gill Pratt of DARPA fame, who now is the CEO of Toyota Research Institute (TRI) wherein he announced their new research staff. One member of that staff was James Kuffner, the previous head of Google's robotics group known as Replicant. His departure continues the robotics shakeup at Google. Details here.Other press events ranged from entertaining to informative and included Yamaha Ventures announcing their cooperation with SRI International to jointly turn Yamaha's MotoBot into a real thinking and navigating robot. \"This project will be able to push several boundaries: visualizing data about human motorcycle operation, further quantifying the relationship between rider input and machine behavior, and then using the resulting know-how to build even better vehicles,\" explains Amish Parashar, Director of Strategic Business Development at Yamaha Motor Ventures and Laboratory Silicon Valley Inc.Intel, IBM, Netflix, General Motors and Volkswagen all had keynote presentations but seats for Intel's were the most highly prized. Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich was the featured speaker and he covered so many topics one really has to watch the whole hour and forty minute presentation to capture the full impact of all that he described. The import of what he said -- that we are moving from a time of transactional systems to one that is experiential -- seems predictive of the next few years in electronics, the digital world, robotics and artificial intelligence. Watch the video above or read the condensed version here.IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty told a packed CES audience that Watson and IBM were changing the nature of data processing from transactional to cognitive and that this process would change computing and lead to providing cognition as a service. IBM describes the cognitive process as providing the 3rd hand for a lab technician, very similar to the experiential descriptor used by Intel's CEO. During Rometty's presentation she described how Watson is working with SoftBank to provide global distribution and support for their Pepper robots. Read the condensed version here.Overzealous marketing can be seen regularly in crowdfunding campaigns. CES was similarly full of examples of ventures claiming to be able to provide something useful when, in fact, they need funding to see whether they can actually do what they are promising. Sometimes these companies hire social media people to help promote those very things using viral marketing in their arsenal of advertising tools. There are many examples but the 2014 Robot Butler campaign is a paradigm classic.In a joint marketing campaign for Quirky, which was promoting their array of smart home sensors, switches and products, and subsidiary Wink's hub that combines them into a smart home, they crafted a catchy video ad suggesting that smart homes were better served by Wink products than by a robotic butler. The video entitled (Like a robot butler, but less awkward) showed a couple in bed being uncomfortable with their robot butler peeking in on them as if it were sentient. The ad was supported by the distribution of a bunch of cardboard shipping boxes for non-existent robot butlers which they dropped off on the streets of San Francisco waiting for trash pickup as if they were the empty boxes of real robot butlers. The promoters hyped sightings of those boxes with lots of blog posts, tweets and other social media and even set up a Robot Butler website.AdWeek finally exposed the situation: \"Well, it turns out this was just a social media sensation. There is no real Robot Butler, at least not this one, and the whole misleading campaign, was just for an app that controls home appliances.\u201cThe company behind the app and marketing was called Wink which is owned by Quirky, a New York-based company that makes Internet-connected devices for the home and other gadgets, and General Electric is an investor in Quirky.\"Quirky is for real and subscribed to Wink's parody marketing campaign based on the Robot Butler. The problem was there was no indication that the robot was a hoax, it was not selling out of stock as claimed, it would not be ready for shipment to consumers, and it was not being reviewed by reputable news sources.\"Quirky recently filed for bankruptcy; the Wink component is being sold off as IP to Flextronics International; the advertising \"parody\" (which, in this case, appeared to be a euphemism for \"phony\") failed; and a real robot butler is still many years off.CES draws huge traffic to the worlds of digital, electronics, robotics, IoT and consumer products. Everyone wants to learn about products and thematic or even paradigm changes that will affect their lives in the near future, and over 6,000 members of the media from all over the world were there to gather that information. Their observations have been - and will be - top news stories for months to come.There will be mistakes made in some of those reports as there was in a recent NPR story about Pepper costing $20k when actually it sells for $2k. Nevertheless, the CES experience is a valuable stimulant for all of us in the various industries that make up the robotics industry.The two keynotes mentioned above, by the CEO's of Intel and IBM, describe a trend from transactional to cognitive to experiential. This has import to the robot industry in a variety of ways.There's no reason to overdo the promotion of future products by falsification, stealing content or otherwise hyping a product beyond it's capabilities or possibilities. People read most of the stories and reports coming out of CES because they want facts about products they may want to buy. They want the truth -- and they can handle the truth.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "IBM and Intel describe an experiential future",
      "content": "CEOs from IBM and Intel, in keynote presentations at CES in Las Vegas last week, described and gave examples of disruptive changes in how consumers and businesses transact and interact with their purchases.Intel's Brian Krzanich described the use of embedded chips and cloud services to enable experience-based transactions, many of which lead to sales but others also lead to enhancing the user's experience. Krzanich provided many examples but four stood out and made his case:\n\nAs an aside, Intel recently announced its acquisition of Ascending Technologies, the German developer of the collision avoidant autopilot system used in the 100 drones video above. Last year Intel also made a big investment in Yuneec, whose drones now include onboard Intel RealSense cameras and chips, and Airware, a competing autopilot developer. And this week Intel invested in robotics startup Savioke, maker of the Relay robot which autonomously navigates around hotels delivering toothpaste, towels, Starbucks coffee and other items. IBM's CEO, Ginny Rometty, told a packed CES audience that Watson and IBM were changing the nature of data processing from transactional to cognitive. Last year Robert High, CTO of IBM's Watson Group, described the emerging era of embodied cognitive computing leading to providing cognition as a service, as a 3rd hand such as a lab technician might need, or as a concierge as Jibo and Echo (and human concierges) offer, as an office assistant might provide, and in field settings like search and rescue. The cognition process involves machines interacting with humans in writing, verbally, with tactile and visual cues, and with gestures. Cognitive algorithms and cloud computing are the keys to Watson's feats and they also happen to be where Rometty has pushed IBM since her tenure began.Rometty described Watson's progress thus far and demonstrated on stage many areas where applying Watson to an application is changing the nature of the experience. It's not enough to just be able to hear what a user says. Watson must be able to understand what they want, be able to make that happen, and then interact back with the user in as conversational a tone as possible. SoftBank's Pepper robot is an example of how this works. In this excerpt from Rometty's presentation, she and SoftBank Robotics' Kenichi Yoshida announced that IBM will provide global distribution and support for SoftBank's Watson-powered Pepper robot as they scale up to begin selling into China and the U.S. Pepper has already sold 7,000 units in Japan and is in 300 bank branches, and 100 stores. These two CES keynote presentations illustrate how artificial intelligence and data synthesis will provide the backbone to enable meaningful and productive interaction between humans and machines -- not only on screens, but with gestures, visual cues and spoken understandable communication to and from smart devices and robots of all types. And it's not just a near-term future they foretell -- they give examples of where it is already happening.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Toyota Research gets Kuffner; Google gets Brondmo",
      "content": "At a press conference last week at CES, Toyota, led by Gill Pratt of DARPA fame and now CEO of Toyota Research Institute (TRI), informed the world what Toyota intended to do with it's billion dollar investment in their new AI research facilities in Silicon Valley and Cambridge:\u201cUp to now, our industry has measured on-road reliability of autonomous vehicles, in the millions of miles, which is impressive. But to achieve full autonomy we actually need reliability that is a million times better.  We need trillion-mile reliability. Toyota has traditionally been a hardware company because in the past the most important technology for enhancing human mobility was hardware. Times have changed, and software and data are now essential components of Toyota\u2019s future mobility strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is entirely possible that robots will become for today\u2019s Toyota what the car industry was when Toyota made looms. Home robots may be even more personally prized in our future than cars have been in our past. Toyota\u2019s goal is to move people across the room, across town, and across the country.\u201d\"Our initial technical team directing research will include James Kuffner, CMU professor and former head of Google Robotics, who will be our area lead in cloud computing... [and also six others].\"The portion of Pratt's announcement that James Kuffner had left Google and was joining Toyota - and Pratt - was newsworthy in the robotics world. It showcased the changes in leadership stemming from the abrupt earlier departure from Google of Andy Rubin, the original leader who left after a buying spree that brought 8 robotic startups into Google. James Kuffner became the acting CEO of the Replicant robotics group which recently located within the Google X Lab. Conor Dougherty, in a NY Times article, wrote:Google\u2019s robotics division has been plagued by low morale and a lack of leadership since the unit\u2019s founder left abruptly in 2014. Now Alphabet is cleaning it up. Over the last two months, Alphabet, the new holding company that separated Google from its collection of speculative projects, has reframed the robots effort, moving it from a stand-alone division inside Google to a piece of the X research division. The company has also hired Hans Peter Brondmo, a technology industry veteran who last worked at Nokia, to help with management.X, which is run by Astro Teller, is using some element of robotics in numerous projects like self-driving cars; Project Wing, an effort to deliver packages with drone aircraft; and Makani, an effort to capture wind energy with high-flying kites.Brondmo joins Jonathan Rosenberg, who is a troubleshooter for Larry Page, the Google co-founder who is Alphabet\u2019s chief executive, and Aaron Edsinger, previously the CEO of both Meka and Redwood Robotics, in the day-to-day management of the robotics group.The Rubin Google acquisitions include: Schaft, a Japanese start-up developing a humanoid robot; Industrial Perception, a Silicon Valley start-up that developed a computer vision system for loading and unloading trucks; Meka Robotics, a robot developer for academia; Redwood Robotics, a start-up intended to compete with the Baxter robot (and others) entering the small and medium-sized shop and factory marketplace; Bot & Dolly, a maker of robotic camera systems used for special effects such as in the movie \"Gravity;\" Autofuss, a design and marketing firm and a partner in Bot & Dolly; Holomni, a maker of powered caster modules for omnidirectional vehicles and Boston Dynamics, an engineering company specializing in building robots and software for human simulation.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "2015 fundings, IPOs, acquisitions and failures",
      "content": "From the 2015 archives of The Robot Report: 55 fundings of $1.321 billion, 32 acquisitions totalling over $2.27 billion, 2 failures, and one IPO \u2014 all adding up to some surprisingly large figures. [All citations below can be found in the 2015 archives of The Robot Report.]Large and small -- but steadily throughout the year, all types of funding for robotic startups and spin-offs occurred during 2015.Large fundings:Smaller fundings:2015 fundings are almost triple what they were in 2014, and the number of acquisitions has also grown. UAS, robots, robotics and robotic-like apps are entering our lives and workplaces everyday and everywhere \u2014 and getting funded. Unmanned systems were a big component in this year\u2019s fundings as can be seen in this chart by CBInsights:Looking back to the beginning of the digital era, hobbyists and early adopters dabbled for years but not too much happened until three software applications showed businesses how PCs and software could change the way they worked. Business people became aware mostly by word-of-mouth of the qualities and uses of WordStar, VisiCalc and dBase. Even though none of those three companies still exists, their concepts are ubiquitous in our world today.As robots move from behind fixed and caged locations to take their place alongside us (what the new collaborative robots are doing), and as they move from heavy-duty industrial applications to providing assistance and augmenting skills (what the new surgical systems and low-cost data collecting drones are doing), business people can once again see that rising tide and they want in (or said another way, they don\u2019t want to be left out). Ray Kurzweil said that auto companies don\u2019t want to be \u2018Nokia\u2019d\u2019 \u2014 i.e., they don\u2019t want to be pushed aside as typewriters, secretaries and stand-alone word processors were by WordStar, WordPerfect and MS Word, or Nokia\u2019s operating system was by Google\u2019s Android.This awareness accounts for why companies of all types and sizes are finding strategic reasons to acquire robotic ventures to add to their arsenal of products and services. They don\u2019t want to be left behind like Nokia was. And they are paying high prices for their acquisitions. Many thought the multiples Teradyne paid for Universal Robots were unreasonably high. Others suggested that the growth Universal has shown \u2014 and continues to show \u2014 make it worth every penny.Personally, I see that acquisitions make sense to and for the acquirer; I\u2019m just disappointed that the acquired companies won\u2019t go public (there was only a single IPO in 2015!) so that investors such as myself can share in the fun and ride the wave.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Why Co-Bots Will Be a Huge Innovation and Growth Driver for Robotics Industry",
      "content": "This article was first published on IEEE Spectrum Automaton and is republished here with permission. For the IEEE version, click here; for the unabridged version, continue reading.Collaborative robots (also called co-bots) are robots designed to assist humans in the performance of their tasks \u2013 i.e., to work jointly on a project. Because co-bots are almost plug and play - and very low-cost - SMEs are buying and the segment is quickly growing.There are many reasons for the emergence of collaborative robots: to handle ergonomically challenging tasks, using them alongside humans in small-spaced electronics assembly lines, using them because they are affordable, using them because they are plug and play and easily trainable, using them for their flexibility to handle short runs, and using them to offload repetitive and boring jobs. Co-bots are also emerging because sensors and computer power have become so cheap that they are driving down the cost of robots and making them more available to businesses of all sizes. Initially driving this movement was the EU SME Robot P-P-P started in Europe in 2005 with a goal of increasing worker productivity so that labor-intensive tasks wouldn\u2019t be off-shored. Recently the movement has been promoted by the launch of the Baxter robot and its developer and chief promoter Rodney Brooks. And by the ease-of-use factor: co-bots are easier to train and deploy than big industrial robots.Most professional service robots are collaborative by design, hence co-bots aren\u2019t just for SMEs or for manufacturing use. Offices, homes, labs, warehouses, farms, distribution centers, hospitals and healthcare facilities are all enabling service robots to help them do their jobs better. The market is open-ended but current uses for co-bots include machine tending, material handling, assembly tasks and packaging. They also pick and place, count and inspect. As more co-bots are deployed, more uses will be discovered.In a human-machine study conducted by an MIT professor at a BMW factory, it was shown that teams made of humans and robots collaborating efficiently can be more productive than teams made of either humans or robots alone. Also, the cooperative process reduced human idle time by 85%.At present, sales of collaborative robots represent 5% of the overall robot market but with strong growth expectations for the future. In fact, the market acceptance of collaborative robots and also drones are expected to be significant drivers in non-industrial robotic growth. This non-industrial growth will be split and different for differing aspects of the service robotics marketplace but as Tractica, a Colorado research firm projects, growth will be significant, exponential, and near-term.The collaborative robotics sector is expected to increase roughly tenfold between 2015 and 2020, reaching over $1 billion from approximately $95M in 2014. Insiders suggest more rapid growth: that collaborative lightweight robots will become the top seller in the industry in about 2 years, selling hundreds of thousands and with prices falling to the $15,000-$20,000 level. TechNavio, a British market research firm, in their September, 2015, $2,500 report, forecasts the global collaborative robots market to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50.88% to 2019.Industrial robots are caged to keep humans safe and out of harm\u2019s way. Service robots are meant to safely leave the cage while doing tasks for humans. Collaborative robots come in all sizes and shapes and have integrated sensors and soft and rounded surfaces for safety purposes and to reduce the risk of impact, pinching and crushing. The biggest safety feature of collaborative robots is their force limited joints which are designed to sense forces due to impact and quickly react.Rethink Robotics, a venture-funded Boston-based robotics firm headed by Rodney Brooks, markets a two-armed industrial robot named Baxter with a base price of $25,000 that can carry out relatively advanced functions such as removing defective items from product lines, packing finished items into boxes and performing basic quality-control inspections. Additional purchase costs include a mobile pedestal ($3,000), gripper ($1,750), and a 2-year hardware and software service contract ($7,000). With an expected useful life of three years, 40 hours of operation per week translates into an average cost of around $4/hour. Though this comes before additional expenses for electricity, maintenance and repair, it remains highly competitive with manufacturing wages in the emerging world.\n\nRethink also sells a narrower one-armed robot named Sawyer with a base price of $29,000 and similar additional costs as Baxter. Sawyer is designed primarily for machine tending, circuit board testing, and other precise, repetitive tasks, specifically those that take place in the middle of a long assembly line of electronics products. There\u2019s a huge need for a robot that can do tasks like these, especially in Asia, and that\u2019s the market Rethink is going after with Sawyer. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into mass electronics manufacturing,\u201d said Brooks in an interview connected with the receipt of a funding round for scaling up sales into China and the promotion of a distribution agreement with Shanghai Electric.Universal Robots, a Danish startup whose one-armed, 6-axis robots have had significant success in the marketplace. At this time they are the market leader producing at an annual run-rate of 5,000+ co-bots. They recently added a third robot to their product line and now have over 200 integrators and distributors around the world and thousands of sold robots at work in SME and larger factories.\n\nAll three of their robots are identical except in size and carry. The UR3, UR5 and UR10 can carry up to 3, 5 and 10 kilograms of load (6.6, 11 and 22 pounds). Pricewise, the UR10 costs $45,000, the UR5 costs $35,000 and the new UR3 is priced at $23,000. The UR3 can handle payloads of up to 3 kg (6.6 lbs), and perform tasks which include: mounting of small objects, gluing, screwing (it can tighten applying the correct torque), operating tools, soldering and painting. It has a reach radius of 500 mm (19.7 in) allowing it to be deployed in tight spaces.Universal has found another and perhaps bigger use of co-bots through their work with automaker BMW, which already has 7,500 industrial robots at work in their factories. BMW has been testing UR robots alongside factory workers who had been tasked with ergonomically challenging assignments. The robots were quickly trained for those tasks and performed perfectly while freeing up the worker to do even more of what he or she was doing. The results of the tests turned out so well that a BMW spokesman, who oversaw the testing, said that it was likely that BMW would soon double or even triple their number of robots by the use of these low-cost, portable, easy-to-program, safe to work alongside robots. [Thus one can easily see why Teradyne paid $350,000,000 for Universal Robots with that kind of endorsement and prospect for the future.]\n\nMRK-Systeme GmbH, a German integrator of industrial robot technology, offers two collaborative software packages which work, at present, with KUKA\u2019s 5SI low-payload robot: SafeGuiding for moving the robot manually to teach it applications, and SafeInteraction which provides five human-robot safety functions to the robot control system. They also integrate Kuka\u2019s robot into their own branded KR 5 SI one-armed robot.\nF&P Personal Robotics, a Swiss spin-off from the University of Zurich, offers a line of co-bots emphasizing safety and functionality. Their robots are context aware, use soft material covers, have limited and controlled force sensors, motor torque is limited by the controller, and their software uses deep learning AI to enable their robots to adapt and improve based on human feedback. F&P recently introduced their new  P-Rob 2, an all-in-one robotic arm, with sensors and software embedded in a PC as control unit in the base of the robot.\nBosch developed the APAS line of co-bots and has deployed 50 of them, mostly for internal operations. Safety is provided by a special sensor skin and software controls. Training is done using a graphic user interface on a teach pendant and the robot can be outfitted with an optional 3D camera system.The Bosch APAS system was the first to be certified as an assistance system, i.e., safe to work alongside with human workers.ABB, one of the Big Four global industrial robot manufacturers, recently launched a two-armed collaborative robot capable of advanced manual tasks. Called YuMi, the robot is able, with a high degree of precision, to handle small parts assembly such as mechanical components for watches, smartphones, tablets, PCs and other consumer electronics. The YuMi is dexterous enough to be able to thread a needle.Early in 2015 ABB acquired gomTec, a startup producing a one-armed co-bot named Roberta. gomTec was a 25-person German company headed by Bernd Gombert, a mechatronics engineer with 100+ patents and who was the head of a DLR project which became KUKA\u2019s LBR iiwa robot (see below). Roberta is a family of 6-axis modular co-bots using custom-made brushless motors and harmonic drives. Safety sensors and joint torque sensors can be optionally added. ABB is in the process of integrating a new intuitive programming user interface and rebranding Roberta to ABB\u2019s brand and expects to launch in Q1 or Q2 of 2016.\n\nBecause ABB is so big and has such an extensive sales, distributor and integrator marketing force, they are expected to quickly penetrate the small parts assembly market with their lineup of plug and play one- and two-armed low-cost co-bots.MABI Robotic is a Swiss manufacturer of industrial robots. Their slick precision Speedy 10 one-armed table-top robot is lightweight, fast, easily trained but unclear as to whether it is safe to work alongside.\n\nFANUC Corp makes CNCs, servo motors, lasers and a full line of industrial robots. Fanuc is the biggest of the Big Four robotic providers. Their CR-35iA is their first collaborative robot and it can carry the heaviest load of all the co-bots so far announced, 77 pounds, and has full safety compliance using soft rubber skin and multiple sensors including either a vision sensor or a 3D area sensor.The CR-35iA is too big for work in a narrow space such as on an electronics assembly line but it\u2019s ability to carry heavy loads opens it up to other tasks better suited for a robot than a human such as inserting a spare tire into a new car\u2019s compartment.\n\nSmokie Robotics, a Tennessee startup, produces a modular one-armed robot configurable for 3 to 7 DoFs. Their OUR-1 robot uses open source architecture enabling easy integration into existing production systems and their OUR-2 robot will be available in Q1 2016.KUKA Robot Group, headquartered in Augsburg, Germany, is one of the global Big Four producers of industrial robots. Their first foray into co-bots is the LBR iiwa (lighweight robot, intelligent industrial work assistant) which comes with the ability to carry 15 or 30 pounds of payload and the Sunrise controller. The robot has 7 joint torque sensors which enables the control system to detect externally applied forces. The robot has the sensitivity of a human and can quickly feed information through the controller to safely control the motions of the robot.The KUKA LBR iiwa fully complies with the industry safety standard ISO 10218 and the new standards for human-robot collaboration ISO 12100 and ISO 13849. Also, the LBR robot has been at work in the Daimler transmission plant since it was first tested in 2009. It has been used in the processing of more than 500,000 transmissions since then. Although the robot is programmed to perform automatically, it approaches objects carefully and adjusts to changed conditions. For example, if a workpiece is not optimally positioned, the robot adjusts its motion sequence accordingly using it\u2019s SafeOperation software to restrict or monitor workspaces and safety zones between machines or between humans and machines.\n\nKUKA, like the other Big Four vendors, has a global marketing capability consisting of sales people, distributors, integrators and resellers. If they can get the selling price down from its present $100k+, they have the ability to become a major player in the SME market \u2013 a significant breakthrough expanding KUKA\u2019s products into that arena.\n\nKawada Industries makes the Nextage two-armed industrial robot. Safety is handled by the stereo vision cameras in the head and by using low-power motors and elbow controls so that don\u2019t jut outwards even when both arms are in operation. Over 150 of the $60,000 robots have been sold and are at work in factories in Japan, according to Discuss Japan in a May, 2015 report.As robots move from behind fixed and caged locations to alongside us - as they move from heavy-duty industrial applications to providing assistance and augmenting skills - and as the metrics of robot ownership and deployment change and become more affordable, business people can see that rising tide of change and they want in (or said another way, they don't want to be left out). Thus companies of all types and sizes are finding strategic reasons to acquire or invest in robotics and robotic ventures to add to their arsenal of products and services. They don't want to be left.Universal Robots has a big head start. 2016 will likely see them continue to lead but KUKA, ABB and FANUC will begin to make inroads and experiment with different prices. By the beginning of 2017, the competition will become even more intense as the number of co-bots sold approaches 15,000 units - $0.5 billion in sales revenue. It\u2019s still too early in the evolution of co-bots for provider consolidation, but some systems are sure to be preferred because of their flexibility, ease of training and support base.The SME marketplace is huge \u2013 6 million companies worldwide and almost 70% of the world\u2019s manufacturing. A few low-cost plug and play robotic tools can easily fit into the manufacturing process in most of these companies which is why it is easy to imagine that co-bots could be on track to sell hundreds of thousands of units beginning as early as 2018. \u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Jibo got $16 million from Asian VCs to enable Jibo to speak and sell in Japan and China, while Blue River Technology got $17 million from a group of agricultural VCs to expand product development to new areas, as funding for robotic ventures continues to soar.UPDATED 12-18-2015: Adds funding for Soft Robotics, Inc.UPDATED 12-21-2015: Adds funding for Na\u00efo Technologies.UPDATED 12-22-2015: Adds funding for FlyabilityJibo, the Cambridge-based maker of a family robot that expects to deliver 7,500 pre-ordered units and then launch a marketing campaign in March/April of 2016, got $16 million in funding from two Asian VC firms. The funding is to localize apps and gestures and enable Jibo to speak Japanese and Chinese so that it can be sold to those markets.\u201cWe\u2019ve received significant interest from Asia. I just got back from Japan and there\u2019s a different kind of interest in that market for robots. In the US, it\u2019s more about what can this robot do for me. But in Japan, there\u2019s almost a folk lore to robots,\u201d said Jibo CEO Steve Chambers.Aaron Tilley on the Forbes staff wrote: \"Jibo has a robot head that swivels on a static base in a cartoon-like manner. Users can talk to Jibo, and it will talk back. Jibo can also take pictures or play games. The robot\u2019s camera recognizes users and remembers their preferences. The company is integrating Jibo with a bunch of third-party services to open up what the robot can do. A Skype integration, for instance, would allow the user to take calls on the robot and then have the robot\u2019s camera follow them as they move around. Some companies are interested in integrating Jibo with other smart home devices. The company is also now working on these third-party integrations with Internet services in China and Japan.Blue River Technology, a Silicon Valley startup, has perfected its lettuce-thinning technology and is now providing that service to 10% of the growers in the industry. This new round of funding is to expand their technologies to be able to sense each individual plant, determine its health and needs and then precisely apply the correct amount of care, plant by plant, at tractor speed, the very definition of precision agriculture.Blue River uses computer vision and robotics for various agricultural tasks. It was founded in 2011 by two Stanford University alumni, and has made breakthrough algorithms and robotic solutions for identifying weeds and selectively killing unwanted plants. Its solution is particularly suited to organic agriculture and for fields with chemical-resistant weeds.Osaro, a San Francisco startup, received $3.3 million in seed funding to accelerate the development of AI for robots to speed up the training and programming process.Soft Robotics Inc., a Boston startup, received $3 million in Series A funding from Material Impact Fund, Taylor Farms Ventures and Haiyin Capital. The funds will be used to enable rapid growth and widespread deployment of their unique gripper system for advanced manufacturing and food handling and the ag industry not only in the U.S. but in China as well.Na\u00efo Technologies, a French startup with its first sales in 2015, raised $3.3 million from the Emertec and CapAgro investment funds, a WiSeed crowdfunding campaign and via its previous shareholders. The newly obtained funds will allow the company to finance international expansion, R&D activities and to double sales in 2016.Flyability, a Swiss drone startup, raised $2.53 million. \u201cThis round brings Flyability the resources needed to launch its first product to market, which will be available in 2016\u201d, said Patrick The\u0301voz, co-founder and CEO of the company. The company has already shipped prototypes to its first customers focusing on industrial inspection in the energy and transport infrastructure industries, and first responders such as firefighters, police forces, and search & rescue professionals.Kurion, a California integrator of service robots for high-risk applications, acquired Oxford Technologies, a 60-employee UK and EU provider of robotic services for nuclear facilities and clean rooms, for an undisclosed amount.BOTTOM LINE: Money continues to flow to robotic ventures well into the holiday season. Over $1.2 billion has been invested in more than 50 robotic startup companies, and an amount well above that figure has been involved in 29 acquisitions.

      "title": "Passion for utility drove his vision for robotics",
      "content": "I'm saddened to report that Joseph Engelberger, 90, the robot pioneer who helped invent the first American industrial robot, and a man that had a significant impact on my interest in robotics, passed away.In 2003, BusinessWeek interviewed Engelberger. The article was entitled \"How Robots Lost Their Way.\" Included in the story was a plea for money to build an eldercare robot that Engelberger thought could be built with then-current technologies, rented for $600 per month, operated at a cost of $1.25 per hour (compared to healthcare homeworkers who cost around $15 per hour) and developed at a cost of less than $700,000.\"The robot I'm working on will be two-armed, mobile, sensate, and articulate. It doesn't need to communicate a great deal to meet the needs of an 85-year-old. A human can ask: 'What's for lunch?' and the robot can respond with what it's able to make, or it can say: 'We're going to Johnny's,' or 'We just had lunch.' The voice recognition, behavioral systems, and artificial intelligence necessary to do this are ready. Most of the other technologies are, too. We don't need more navigation development\u2014getting around an apartment is easier than moving through a hospital or on Mars, which robots do now. I could prove this functionality with the right partner for about $700,000 in 14 months or less.\"A few years after reading the BusinessWeek story, I tracked down Engelberger and phoned him. We had several long conversations on the subject. He was a fun character to talk with, and I learned much in the process. But when we got to the part where I offered him the money he needed, he said,\"No. I don't want your money. You're just an investor. I want money and partnerships with Panasonic, or Johnson & Johnson, Philips, or Siemens. They're in the business [healthcare products], have deep pockets, and have what I need for the robot to be successful: 1. design and manufacturing capability and 2. marketing experience in the health and eldercare marketplace.\"He wanted strategic partnerships with companies that had already penetrated the marketing chain, had manufacturing experience regarding healthcare devices AND the deep pockets for the long haul of bringing the product to market and then supporting it and growing the product line.That was in 2006. After all this time, Engelberger's eldercare vision is still a work in progress in research labs and startup companies around the world. Products are emerging but very slowly and their solutions are not as broad-based and flexible as Joe imagined. Most are single-purposed and not for home use; and none are produced by the companies Engelberger mentioned. Panasonic has a line of robotic hospital devices; Johnson & Johnson discontinued their iBot stair-climbing wheelchair; and Honda and Toyota showcase their walking research robots but don't have any healthcare robots available for purchase.I learned a lot from my conversations with Joe. I shared his passion for the utility of the product (and not the process of developing it) and for his understanding of the value of strategic partners versus investors. He made a lot of sense to me and helped guide me in my interest in robotics. I'm very grateful... and saddened that he died.If you would like to learn more about Joe, the Robotic Industries Association has posted an obituary here.____________Portions of this article were excerpted from an article I wrote which appeared in 2012 in IEEE Spectrum.Photo from BusinessWeek magazine, 2003.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Ten more fundings of robotic companies (47 so far in 2015); three more acquisitions (bringing the 2015 total to 28); and an important strategic partnership all took place in October and November and are recapped below.UPDATED 11/30/2015: Adds the November acquisition of Blue Belt Technologies by Smith & Nephew for $275 million. Blue Belt has been working on, and plans to launch in 2017, a total knee system, and has hip arthroplasty in its pipeline. Medrobotics, the Raynham, MA developer of the Flex Robotic System, a snake-like \u0003minimally invasive system to reach into locations that were \u0003previously difficult to reach, closed a $25 million preferred stock financing package with existing shareholders. Proceeds will be used to expand the commercialization process of the Flex Robot System which received FDA approval in July.Aeryon Labs, a Canadian military and first responder drone and vision systems maker, secured $45.9 million from Boston-based Summit Partners. \"In the last four years, we have grown 100 percent year-over-year in terms of sales and we've been profitable too, and we now expect that to move into the 200 percent sales growth range over the next couple of years,\" said Aeryon's Chief Executive Dave Kroetsch in an interview. \"The cash infusion from Summit Partners will not only help the firm boost sales, but also more than double its headcount to about 200 people, most of whom will be based in and around its headquarters in Waterloo.\"SkySpecs, an Ann Arbor, Michigan startup integrating an automated, drone-based data collection, vision, and analytics service for wind turbine and infrastructure inspection, received $3 million in equity funding. SkySpecs also received an FAA waiver to fly its drones commercially and landed its first two wind turbine inspection customers.Righthand Robotics, a Cambridge, MA stealthy startup and developer of a 3-fingered dexterous gripper, raised $3.3 million from angel investors and VCs to continue developing their intelligent robotic order-picking system. RightHand's technology, with flexible grasping and fingertip barometric and tactile sensors, enables items which can be grasped by \"feel\".Jibo, the social intelligent humanoid, received additional funding of an undisclosed amount from Fenox Venture Capital, a Silicon Valley-based VC firm. Fenox has arranged partnerships with SEGA SAMMY Holdings and CAC Holdings to help Jibo expand its sales and marketing in Japan and throughout the Asian marketplace.CyPhy Works, a Danvers, MA startup headed by ex-iRobot co-founder and President Helen Greiner, received $22 million after raising an additional $900K from a Kickstarter campaign. CyPhy's tether technology enable its drones to stay aloft indefinitely, stream what it sees in high definition, and have its communications be secure and unjammable thereby valuable to defense, security, police, fire fighters and search operators.Petnet, the manufacturer of a smart feeder for cats and dogs, raised $4 million from Amazon, iRobot and Black River, to expand and build out its digital supply chain strategy for pet owners.MiR Mobile Industrial Robots received $1.436 million from five Danish investors after turning down offers from American, Chinese and EU VCs. The Danish startup of a mobile robotic platform for logistics chose five Danish investors who are investing their own money in MiR. This is a similar financing path that Universal Robots took and UR's CTO Esben \u00d8stergaard is one of those investors. \u201cAfter having been in dialog with a number of large and interesting investors, who each, of course, had their own agendas and wishes for strong influence, I stopped and thought: What is really important to a growth business? To be in control yourself and have freedom to act fast and in time! Consequently, I explored the possibilities among the existing owners, the board of directors and the network around MiR, and here a picture quickly emerged of an obvious, strong team of dedicated Danish investors. As I see it, we now have the required growth capital as well as the right competencies among the board members and owners in relation to where MiR is now,\u201d says Thomas Visti, CEO.Bionik Labs, a Canadian medical robotics startup company that develops exoskeleton solutions for people with restricted physical mobility, sold $6.2 million in stock and warrants (in February, 2015) in a private placement.Corepath Robotics, a Danish startup using new-tech training methods to teach welding, milling and plasma cutting robots how to flexibly handle low-volume tasks, received $355K from two Danish VC funds.ConMed, a New York state medical tech provider of surgical devices for minimally invasive procedures, acquired SurgiQuest for $265 million. SurgiQuest's AirSeal system enables access for robotics and laparoscopy procedures and has been used in more than 250K procedures in over 45 countries. Kraken Sonar, a Newfoundland startup, acquired the unmanned marine assets and intellectual property of Marine Robotics, Inc.\"We believe that the ocean drone market is at an inflection point and set for major growth,\" said Karl Kenny, President and CEO of Kraken. \"This acquisition brings us a significant underwater technology and IP portfolio and continues to build on our sensors-to-systems strategy to be a market leader in the Unmanned Maritime Systems industry.\"Included in the assets acquired are underwater robotics technology, IP and related physical assets -- including an operational SQX-500 Unmanned Underwater Vehicle. In addition, the majority of the senior electrical, mechanical and software engineers that were previously employed by Marine Robotics Inc. are now Kraken employees.Smith & Nephew, a global medical tech conglomerate that is expanding into robotics-assisted surgeries, announced that they are paying $275 million to acquire Pittsburgh startup Blue Belt Technologies. Blue Belt has developed a robotic-assisted surgical system for knee replacement. Smith & Nephew is already Blue Belt's sales partner and distributor.Shenzhen DJI Innovations, the maker of the very successful line of DJI drones, has purchased a minority state in Hasselblad, the Swedish-based camera firm, for an undisclosed amount. Frank Wang, DJI founder and CEO, said the two companies \u201cshare a passion to provide creative people with cutting-edge, inventive technology to help them take visual storytelling to the next level. The partnership will also help to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in imaging technology,\" he added.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "As surgeons develop and use ever-more capable robotic augmentation devices for their surgical procedures, many startup companies are being acquired by global medical device conglomerates. Stryker's $1.65 billion acquisition of MAKO Surgical in September, 2013 is an example.UPDATED 12-2-2015: Fixes incorrect information about Auris Robotic Systems (see below).Smith & Nephew, a global medical tech conglomerate that is expanding into robotics-assisted surgeries, announced that they are paying $275 million to acquire Pittsburgh startup Blue Belt Technologies. Blue Belt has developed a robotic-assisted surgical system for knee replacement. Smith & Nephew is already Blue Belt's sales partner and distributor. Blue Belt has been working on, and plans to launch in 2017, a total knee system, and has hip arthroplasty in its pipeline.Olivier Bohuon, Chief Executive Officer of Smith & Nephew said, \u201cThis acquisition is a compelling strategic move, with the combination of complementary products and R&D programs creating a platform from which we can shape this exciting new area of surgery. It reinforces our distinctive orthopaedic reconstruction strategy, which combines cutting edge innovation, disruptive business models and a strong emerging markets platform to drive outperformance.\u201dThe surgical robot device market was estimated to be $3.2 billion in 2014 and forecast to reach $20 billion by 2021 as next generation devices, systems and instruments are introduced to manage surgery through small ports in the body instead of large open wounds. The market is characterized by enormous variety and innovation from snake robots to navigation systems to highly articulated devices such as the da Vinci surgical system from Intuitive Surgical. This dynamic growth industry will involve many shifts in ownership and funding, suggests RNR Market Research in their 553 page, $4,000 report published in April.Auris Medical Robotics, the Peter Thiel backed startup developing an eye surgery robotic device, received $150 million from undisclosed sources, MedCity News reported from an analysis of regulartory filings. Just last year, Auris raised a $34 million from some 20 backers, including Highland Capital Partners, Lux Capital and Mithril Capital Management. It was previously - and incorrectly reported - that Auris had been acquired for $150 million.In addition to Stryker's $1.5 billion acquisition of MAKO, many other robotic medical device startups have been acquired including Hansen Medical which acquired the rights to Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics and also acquired EndoVia Medical and AorTx; Intuitive Surgical acquired licenses from Power Medical Interventions; and TransEnterix Surgical acquired the TELELAP ALF-X project for $100 million.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "30,000 robots now work at Amazon; competing systems emerging",
      "content": "Amazon announced that at the end of September they had 30,000 Kiva robots at work in 13 fulfillment centers. \"Our intent is to use [Kiva robots and the Amazon Robotics subsidiary] more widely, so stay tuned.\"UPDATED 11-1-2015: Added Grenzebach's G-Com storage and picking system to the list of vendors offering competing systems to Kiva's.Phil Hardin, Amazon's director of investor releations also said:\"The wider use of robots at fulfillment centers has had a direct impact on productivity. It\u2019s a bit of an investment that has implications for a lot of elements of our cost structure, but we\u2019re happy with Kiva. It has been a great innovation for us, and we think it makes the warehouse jobs better, and we think it makes our warehouses more productive.\u201dAmazon acquired Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012 and recently renamed it Amazon Robotics. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon. This left a big gap in the marketplace for robotic innovation in distribution and fulfillment centers because Kiva's goods-to-man technology was taken inhouse by Amazon.Distribution centers are principle parts of the order processing and fulfillment process. [Distribution centers can also be called warehouses, DCs, fulfillment centers and package handling centers.] As the e-commerce boom continues to grow, warehouse managers need to find new suppliers to meet their automation needs for their DCs. Amazon is just one of many online e-commerce providers in need of robots and automation in their DCs. Alibaba and Jingdong in China and Flipkart and Snapdeal in India are also big e-commerce companies adding robots to their warehouses.eCommerce is the fastest growing segment of retail. In 2013 it represented less than 10% of overall retail but has been growing at nearly 15% annually and is expected to continue at that rate for the remainder of the decade. Online retailers are having to change their operations to meet this growing demand.A few startups are beginning to enter the market to fill the gap left by Kiva:  \u200bIn addition to the startups mentioned above, old-line companies are also entering the market. The 55-year old Germany-headquartered Grenzebach Group is a good example. Grenzebach has held interests in KUKA, Inos Automation, SnoxStellar AGVs, and Swisslog -  all involved in robotics, vision systems and materials handling and all involved in their new G-Com mobile storage and picking system. Grenzebach is still the controlling partner in all but KUKA and Swisslog. [KUKA bought back it's shares from Grenzebach and acquired Swisslog for $357 million in September, 2014.] BLG Logistics was awarded the German Logistics Award 2015 for an installation in the warehouse of a trading company of 74 Grenzebach G-Com robots delivering goods from 800 shelves to 5 picking stations.Bottom line: Amazon isn't the only e-commerce warehouse operator adding robots to their automation arsenal. Think Coca Cola, Walmart, Nike, Ikea, FedEx, UPS and Diapers. And there are hundreds of name-brand suppliers of warehousing automation technology such as Westfalia, Egemin, Schaefer, Swisslog, Vanderlande, Daifuku, Intelligrated, JBT, Knapp and Thiele to name just a few. There is a transition in technology to reduce fixed racking and conveyor costs in favor of dynamic storage and mobility methods. Thus far only Kiva and these new startups are offering that level of disruptive system but the big companies are sure to enter the fray soon with competing products.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "We have reported 37 equity fundings and 25 acquisitions so far this year. It's not just the car companies searching for talent and innovation in their new Silicon Valley centers. Israel, Russia, China and big companies like Bosch, SoftBank, Apple and Google are all investing in robotics for various strategic reasons. Many new robotics companies have been acquired this year and even more have been funded. Drone makers 3D Robotics, DJI Innovations and Yuneec Aviation all received massive amounts of equity funding ($50M, $75M and $60M respectively). But even more money was invested by acquisitions. Adept Technologies was acquired by Japanese OMRON Industrial Automation for $200M, Universal Robots by Teradyne for $350M, VGo by Vecna for an undisclosed amount, Segway by Chinese Ninebot and gomTec by ABB. The rationale behind each purchase was strategic as was the $600M joint venture supporting the roll-out of the Pepper robot in Japan and China by SoftBank, Alibaba and Foxconn. Additionally, three R&D ventures stand out as particularly far-reaching and interesting:A new Sino-Israeli Robotics Institute is being developed as the centerpiece of a $2 billion industrial park in the Guangzhou region of China. It will house entities built around the technology developed jointly by Israeli and Chinese researchers at the new institute. \u201cChina is a major opportunity for us, and manufacturers there are very motivated to take advantage of our technology. There are many factories that will be interested in the technology developed at the Institute\u201d said Zvi Shiller, chairman of the Israel Robotics Association.\nEarlier this year there was another Chinese joint venture with the Russians. The Skolkovo Foundation and Chinese Cybernaut Investment Group inked a deal to establish an R&D business incubator at the Skolkovo Innovation Center in the outskirts of Moscow where it will house at least 15 startups into IT and robotics, space, energy-efficiency tech and new materials which will be developed and marketed in and from China.\n _____*  I visited two Bosch startups in the Renningen area last year as their new campus was under construction. Wholly-owned by Bosch but entrepreneurial startups dotted the office landscape all over the area. The new campus, and Bosch's encouragement of interdisciplinary collaboration, were sorely needed and show Bosch's goal of staying one step ahead of technological breakthroughs while adding some of the benefits of a unique community environment.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "IFR predicts double digit growth for service robots through 2018",
      "content": "The service robotics industry is relatively new, diverse, and picking up steam daily. Service robotics covers every robotic activity except those described as industrial. They are robots that perform useful tasks for humans and are categorized as either personal or professional.Service robots cross definitional borders. They collaborate safely with humans and they move goods of all types for all types of purposes. Mobile robots fly, swim, run, jump, clean and glide. They milk. They help. They assist in factories, shops, homes and hospitals. One significant difference between industrial robots and service robotics is that for the latter, there is no multiplier for additional costs associated with getting the robot up and operating in a safe fixed location. Service robots, particularly service robots for personal and private use, tend to be self-contained and/or plug and play and not in need of integration services as is the case with industrial robots.The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) just published their World Robotics Service Robots statistical review of 2014 (with projections through 2018). The 316-page $675 report details the sales revenue and units sold by category from a database of approximately 300 service robot manufacturers around the globe.Revenue from the sale of industrial robots was $10.7 billion and an additional $21.3 billion for supporting services such as integration, peripherals, software and systems engineering -- $32 billion in total. Service robotics (both professional and private) totaled $5.97 billion. Therefore, the combined value of the robotics industry, service, support and industrial for 2014 was $38 billion.There are many, many variables that could seriously alter these projections. The IFR acknowledges this problem as follows:The 4 year projections are conservative due to the character of the company feed-back. Typically companies only report projections of sales of existing products (or at least pre-series products that are about to be launched). Therefore a future product, Jibo for example, is not reported and counted.Nevertheless, the projections are very likely to be seriously understated for a variety of possible reasons:[The IFR produced their report and based their projections on a limited database of 300 service robot companies of which 15% were startups. The Robot Report's database contains over 900 service robot companies and an additional 400 service startups. The IFR's database is distributed 23% from Asia, 36% from the US and Canada, and 41% from the UK, EU and elsewhere. The Robot Report's database is quite similarly distributed for service companies but it differs significantly in where the startups are located: only 12% in Asia,  48% in the US and Canada, and 40% in the UK, EU, Israel and elsewhere.]\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "August and September Fundings Report",
      "content": "August and September equity fundings, joint ventures, acquisitions and venture funds continue the momentum exhibited throughout 2015 of serious money flowing into robotics startups. For a list of acquisitions, click here.GE Ventures has become a strategic investor in Clearpath Robotics for an undisclosed sum. This follows a March, 2015 $11.5 Series A funding round for Clearpath. GE invested after three years of collaboration on the development of Clearpath\u2019s new OTTO heavy load mobility platform which was displayed last week at RoboBusiness. GE is also the first purchaser of the OTTO.\nDronomy, an Israili drone technology startup, got $1.5M to continue the development of collision avoidance software. The Dronomy team and it's VC investors have ties to the Israeli air force.\nIntel Capital invested $60M in Hong Kong drone startup Yuneec Electric Aviation last month. Intel and Yuneec will work on developing future products. Yuneec makes drones for consumers and industrial users, as well as manned electric aircraft. Intel has invested in other drone companies such as Airware and PrecisionHawk. These drone relationships fit with Intel\u2019s strategy to make investments in companies developing products with the potential to expand the market for semiconductors, as the company searches for new devices for chips. Qualcomm is doing the same kind of strategic investments for their chip development.\nVirtual Incision, a Nebraska-based startup developing minimally-invasive mini-robot surgical devices for colon resection and other abdominal procedures, received $11.2M in venture funding. The funding will be used for feasibility studies on the use of the company\u2019s surgical technology for colon resection, inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.Jibo, Inc., the social robot which last year had the successful $3.7 million Indiegogo crowd funding, recently got an $11M add-on to the previous $25.3M A round to concentrate on the Asian market. With this $11M, Jibo has now raised $38.6M and expects to begin shipping crowdfund and preorders in December, 2015.HUVR Data Services, one of the many new companies using robotic technology to provide that technology as a service to clients, gets $2M in Series A funding. HUVR uses drones to inspect industrial and agricultural assets and provides data analytics to their clients.Peloton Technology, a Silicon Valley startup providing truck platooning technology, got $17 million from some strategic investors after receiving $16M just a few months earlier in April. Denso Intl. was the lead investor in both funding rounds. Denso is a Japanese robot maker that also provides technology and components to the global auto industry.GreyOrange, an India and Singapore-based materials handling startup, received $30 million in equity funding to ramp up production of their Butler shelves-to-picker robot system. GreyOrange currently has 300+ employees which it plans to double with this new funding.Midea Group, a large Chinese home appliance maker, formed two joint ventures with Yaskawa Electric. Yaskawa is one of the worldwide Big Four manufacturers of industrial robots. Midea and Yaskawa wil invest a total of $65M in two new as-yet unnamed ventures. One will be focused on service robots. Midea will own 60% of this venture. The other will focus on industrial robots and Yaskawa will own 51%. Both new ventures will be based in Guangdong, China and will be responsible for research, manufacturing and marketing. Midea hopes its expansion into the robot industry will help upgrade its own manufacturing and industrial automation. It also hopes that Yaskawa\u2019s technologies and products in service robots will help Midea find new business opportunities as China addresses the economic impact of a huge aging population in the coming years.GE Ventures, which has been activly investing in robotics startups (including the one to Clearpath Robotics described above), created a new $20M fund with Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) National Robotics Engineering Center. The new fund, The Robotics Hub AKA Coal Hill Ventures, will begin writing checks early in 2016 for anywhere between $200,000 and $2 million for 20 to 30 emerging robotics startup companies that will be part of The Robotics Hub.The strategy that\u2019s most important to GE is to really get behind startups and help them scale. A lot of companies can come with the money, but what we bring is the ability to scale and the opportunity to commercialize quite quickly.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "Why 10 more robotics companies were acquired",
      "content": "At last week's RoboBusiness Conference and Expo in San Jose, there was much gossip, discussion and head scratching regarding the two most recent acquisitions of robot companies: Adept Technologies by Omron and Universal Robots by Teradyne.Everyone asked why. Many questioned the business sense of the deals. And others asked why there were so many acquisitions compared to other methods of funding like IPOs or equity investments. As can be seen from the following pages of The Robot Report, there has been a significant increase in the number of acquisitions this year.Here are the most recent 10 acquisitions:The Adept Technologies sale to Omron Industrial Automation wasn't a suprise - the company had been on a losing streak and the board had placed a salvage artist as the CEO - but the amount, $200 million, was. The all cash deal represented a 63% premium over Adept's stock market capitalization the day before the announcement. OMRON, a Kyoto-based global component manufacturer and robotics integrator employs over 39,000 people in 110 countries and has annual revenues of $7.3 billion of which $2.7B was from their industrial automation group. Interestingly and largely unnoticed was the acquisition by Omron a few months earlier of Delta Tau, a motion controller component manufacturer, for an undisclosed sum. An OMRON spokesman said of the two acquisitions, \"These acquisitions are part of our strategy to enhance our automation technology and position us for long term growth. Robotics will elevate our offerings of advanced automation.\u201d\nIn a surprise move in May, 2015, privately held Danish company Universal Robots - the successful producer of the UR line of collaborative robots - sold to Massachusetts-based Teradyne, a provider of electronic testing equipment for $350 million. Universal has had rapid growth since their startup in 2005. Their first products were sold in 2009, their 2014 sales of $38M were 70% greater than 2013 and they have grown their distributor network to over 200 worldwide. Teradyne, a publicly-traded supplier of test equipment with over 3,900 employees and a product line which doesn't include anything robotic, has a market value of $4.37 billion. Teradyne uses robots in their manufacturing process and their customers are good prospects for Universal's robots. A spokesman said of the transaction, \"This acquisition complements our System and Wireless Test businesses while adding a powerful, additional growth platform to Teradyne.\u201d\nJust the other day it was announced that Fred Moll, the entrepreneur behind Intuitive Surgical, Hansen Medical and Origin Medsystems, received $149.5 million in equity funding for his stealthy startup Auris Surgical Robotics. Auris, founded in 2011, with $184.1M in funding since then, described itself as a venture-funded company developing a robotic microsurgical system designed specifically for opthalmic surgery. The company says they are deep in stealth mode with no comment about the funding or how it will be used.\nEarlier this year TransEnterix Surgical, a medical devices company, raised $50M from an IPO and market switch. This week TransEnterix acquired the surgical robotics division of SOFAR Spa, an Italian healthcare and pharma company, for $99.8M. The division acquired has spearheaded the TELELAP ALF-X project (Advanced Laparoscopy through Force Reflection) since 2002. SOFAR received $25M in cash and 15.5M shares of TransEnterix stock; the agreement also provides for $31.1M in cash to be paid in 3 waves based on negotiated milestones.\nOmnicell, a supplier of automation and business analytics software for patient-centric medication and supply management, acquired Florida-based MTS Medication Technologies for $156 million. MTS is developing a pharmacy robot which kits and packages a persons multi-dose daily pills.\nA month earlier Omnicell acquired MACH4 Pharma Systems, a German company, for an undisclosed amount . MACH4 provides modular robotic solutions for dispensing medications in original manufacturers\u2019 packages.RobotShop, the Montreal-based online robot and robot parts reseller, acquired Let's Make Robots, a robot makers and enthusiasts website and community, for an undisclosed amount.Hypertherm, a welding and laser cutting company, acquired Jabez Technologies, a Canadian software provider for an undisclosed amount. Jabez makes Robotmaster CAD/CAM software which integrates off-line programming, simulation and code generation for robots, and delivering quick robot programs.\u200bDMY Capital, an Australian penny stock company, acquired FastBrick Robotics, an Australian startup which has a new robotic system to lay bricks, for $2.25M plus a bonus of $7M if and when FastBrick is able to brick the walls of a house within 3 days. FastBrick has invented a unique navigation and stabilization system that allows for accurate and fast robotic manipulation over very large areas to within 0.5mm accuracy in all axes regardless of dynamic interferences.Lauren International, a consortium of small manufacturing companies, bought Theiss Aviation, a provider of UAVs to US DoD, NASA and other defense organizations, for an undisclosed amount and renamed it to Theiss UAV Solutions. This is Lauren's first purchase into robotics. A Lauren spokesman said, \u201cTheiss UAV solutions wants to bridge the gap between people who fly and businesses that need aerial data collection, enabling businesses to use UAV technology and cultivate a healthy relationship with the FAA.\u201dWe appear to be on the rising curve of a robot renaissance. There is almost continuous media attention; 2015 fundings are already double all of 2014; and the number of acquisitions has also doubled. Robots, robotics and robotic-like apps are entering our lives and workplaces everyday and everywhere.Looking back at the beginning of the digital era, hobbyists and early adopters dabbled for years but not too much happened until three applications showed businesses how PCs and software applications could change the way they worked and make them more productive. As business people became aware of the qualities and uses of WordStar, VisiCalc and dBase, they turned the curve upward exponentially and even though none of those three companies still exists, their concepts are ubiquitous in our world today.As robot moves from behind fixed and caged locations to alongside us - as the new collaborative robots are doing; as they move from heavy-duty industrial applications to providing assistance or augmenting skills - as the new surgical systems and low-cost data collecting drones are doing; as they move from sci-fi movies and toys to real-life cognizant and communicating assistants, business people once again can see that rising tide and they want in (or said another way, they don't want to be left out). Ray Kurzweil said that auto companies don't want to be Nokia'd, i.e., they don't want to be pushed aside as typewriters were by WordStar, WordPerfect and MS Word, or Nokia's operating system was by Google's Android.Thus companies of all types and sizes are finding strategic reasons to acquire robotic ventures to add to their arsenal of products and services. They don't want to be left behind, to be Nokia'd. And they are paying high prices for their acquisitions. Many thought the multiples Teradyne paid for Universal Robots were unreasonably high. Others suggested that the growth Universal has shown - and continues to show - are worth every penny.To me, I see that acquisitions make sense to and for the acquirer; I'm just disappointed that the acquired company won't go public so that investors such as myself can share in the fun and ride the wave.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "In less than 10 years the volume of our business computing will change from transaction processing to cognition processing. So said IBM's Robert High in his keynote talk at RoboBusiness.This is an important enough trend to stimulate IBM to put over $1 billion into their Watson group - a group working on healthcare, legal and other industry segments that can benefit from the same cognition processing technology which enabled Watson to win at Jeopardy. And it's an important enough trend effecting the human-machine interaction space that it is noteworthy in relation to the RoboBusiness conference.High, CTO of IBM's Watson Group, described the emerging era of embodied cognitive computing leading to providing cognition as a service, as a 3rd hand such as a lab technician might need, or as a concierge as Jibo and Echo (and human concierges) offer, as an office assistant might provide and in field settings like search and rescue. The cognition process involves machines interacting with humans in writing, verbally, with tactal and visual cues and with gestures.In another talk ABI Research's Dan Kara described how technology is transitioning to have constant connection to the Internet of Things (IoT) - from self-describing tags telling robots what they are - thereby supporting the robots perception and manipulation processes - to robots acting as gateways for all the IoT devices that might need to communicate with the robot and perhaps each other, to the ultimate situation of everything being ubiquitously connected to everything.10 winners of Robot Launch 2015 were announced - details can be found here - with the Grand Winner being CleverPet, a stylish consumer device responding to the needs of pets and their owners. \u201cThere were winning startups in every category,\u201d said competition organizer Andra Keay. \u201cEvery investor could find something to interest them, from cloud based simulations and new sensing technologies to eldercare, rehabilitative and social robotics.\u201dIn the exposition hall - with over 70 exhibitors - one could see the first public appearance of the new Sawyer robot from Rethink Robotics performing a machine-tending application. Across the aisle was Softbank and Aldebaran's Pepper robot high-fiving and smiling at passers by. These were just a few of the highlights of day one of RoboBusiness, an annual business-focused robotics conference and trade show produced by EH Publishing.Tomorrow's keynote presentations include Ray Kurzweil talking about the coming merger of robots and biology.More to follow.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "Intel Capital invested $60M in Chinese drone startup Yuneek last month. At this week's InterDrone conference and expo, one can readily see why: lots of interest, lots of people, and products that are becoming commodities.Intel and Yuneec will work on developing future products. Yuneec makes drones for consumers and industrial users, as well as manned electric aircraft. Intel has also invested in drone companies Airware and PrecisionHawk. These drone relationships fit with Intel\u2019s strategy to make investments in companies developing products with the potential to expand the market for semiconductors, as the company searches for new devices for chips.Hong Kong-based Yuneek Electric Aviation is one of the Big 3 of drone manufacturers exhibiting at this week's InterDrone International Conference & Exposition in Las Vegas. The other two being SZ DJI Innovations and 3D Robotics. Yuneek and DJI are Chinese companies; 3D Robotics is San Diego based. DJI recently received $75M from Silicon Valley VC Accel Partners. 3D Robotics got $64M so far this year. A study of the 700+ FAA exemptions for commercial drone use shows that the overwhelming majority of them are for companies using DJI quadcopters.Sixty million dollars for Yuneek, $75M to DJI and $64 to 3D Robotics add up to a lot of money and interest. That interest was apparent at the InterDrone event at the Rio Convention Center in Las Vegas. It was the first such event for InterDrone yet from my walk around the show and attendance at a few of the packed conference sessions, it seemed to be successful. 99 exhibitors and over 3,000 visitors. I heard the latter group asking very cogent questions about the ways drones, their capabilities and their data and mapping software could be used for their applications. The crowd appeared to have a high number of foreign visitors as could be seen from the on-site pin-board map at the right.Another observation from the show was the number of secondary exhibitors: GoPro and GoPro accessories, makers of carrying cases, lenses, sensors, mapping software, retail stores carrying multiple lines of drones, cameras and cases. Samy's Camera, a large West Coast camera and printer provider, was showing off the fact that they've been selling all brands of drones for photographic purposes for years.BOTTOM LINE: The commercial drone industry is maturing similar to the way industrial robots matured: a few major manufacturers providing their arms (drones) to thousands of integrators, resellers and value-added service providers which extend the sales reach of the drone (robot) manufacturers.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "content": "In two simultaneous launches last week, Toyota Motor and the UK RAS Group backed their previous statements regarding the imperative for robotics and AI development with money, roadmaps and strategic alliances. Toyota Motor announced an alliance with the AI labs at MIT and Stanford, along with a $50M investment, to develop auto-related sensing and perception, navigation and human-centric learning systems, automated decision making, and human-machine interaction technologies. Gil Pratt, who recently headed the DARPA Robotics Challenge, will lead Toyota's efforts from a new facility in Silicon Valley.At a press conference, the Toyota spokesman repeatedly said that Toyota wasn't going to use this new collaboration to develop self-driving cars; rather, they were planning on augmenting drivers with driver assistance technologies to enhance the commuting experience and reduce highway deaths and injuries.Toyota joins Ford, Mercedes, BMW, Tesla, Honda, Bosch and many other auto companies with AI labs in Silicon Valley and they join more generic AI research by Google, Apple, Baidu and others in the area. Lots of competing methods and an even greater competition for talent.Also announced last week was the establishment and funding of the Northern Robotics Network, a subset of the UK RAS 2020 Robotics and Autonomous Systems Initiative. The new Northern Robotics Network is setting up and funding GAMMA (Growing Autonomous Mission Management Applications), a 3-year, $13.6 million investment by the governments in the Northern regions of the UK to stimulate fast growth and assist with the funding, development and incubation of new ventures in AI and robotics.The UK Government in 2012 identified 8 Great Technologies that support the UK Industrial Strategy to stimulate the UK economy and create jobs and economic growth -- one of which covers robotics and autonomous systems. The government then created the RAS-SIG (Robotics and Autonomous Systems Special Interest Group) which developed a strategic roadmap to achieve their goals, and are now beginning to unfold and fund their various strategies. The Northern Robotics Network is one of those pieces of the overall strategy.The UK is also participating in the European Commission's robotics research and innovation program - a plan to invest $2.8 billion over the next 7 years. The EU Commission itself is investing $850M, and the rest is coming from participating governments and corporations. The goal is to invest in every robotics sector, from industrial robots to domestic, from the fields to space, etc.Japan has a 5-year robotic strategy (Robot Revolution Initiative (RRI)), a group of 200 companies, universities and governmental agencies, to challenge issues unique to Japan, particularly the simultaneous aging of the overall population and the low birth rate causing a reduction in workforce size and a serious shortage of entry-level workers. The plan is to \"spread the use of robotics from large-scale factories to every corner of our economy and society.\" China is just finishing their 12th 5-year plan (2011-2015) and has hired MIT to help formulate a manufacturing, automation and robotics roadmap for the 13th 5-year plan to be released in November, 2015. The present plan to improve quality and automation efficiencies in manufacturing and stimulate an in-country robotics industry (instead of buying robots from elsewhere) is paying off and the numbers show its success: CRIA reports that robot sales in China increased by 54.6% in 2014 to around 57,000 units, 25% of the global total. Nearly 17,000 units were made in China with a value of $474M, an increase of 60% from 2013.In 2011 the US announced $500M to be invested in automation and robotics as part of a $2.2 billion Advanced Manufacturing Initiative and in 2014 set up and funded a $1.3B program to establish 12 manufacturing communities -- regional centers -- for R&D in specific sciences unique to their regions. Each center will receive government and corporate funding to work on strategic automation, AI and robotics to strengthen American manufacturing methods and make it globally competitive.In 2014 Korea announced a $2.7 billion plan in response to the American, Japanese and EU plans. Their new plan is to help existing robotics businesses increase their sales as well as investing in disaster recovery and search and rescue robots and eldercare robots. It was their KAIST robot that won the recent DARPA Robotics Challenge.And there are many good-sized VC-backed funds attempting to stimulate the same set of goals. French Minister Arnaud Montebourg announced the creation of a private fund with $108M headed by Bruno Bonnell focused on service robotics made in France. A Chinese venture fund is providing $200M to partner with the Russian Skolkovo Institute to incubate Russian technology and robotics for manufacture and marketing in China. The new Commercial Drone Fund, $75M Sky Fund, Qualcomm Robotics Accelerator and Idea Hub are all examples of funds established by corporations already in the business to fund startups that might have a beneficial impact on their company and the industry.Thus far, 2015 has been a banner year for funding and incubating robotics and AI science development and startup ventures. There have also been many strategic acquisitions this year such as the sale of Segway, VGo, SMG, gomTec and Universal Robots as corporations add robotics and robot functionality to their arsenal of products and services. There is broad recognition within the business world of the value of robotics and that growing awareness, stimulated by government funding, is translating into dollars to tackle the science of AI, perception, mobility and navigation. Research companies are attempting to detail the rising trend by mining data from various segments within the industry. So far this year the sheer number of research reports has increased 7-fold from five years ago.And the year isn't over yet! There are sure to be interesting announcements at RoboBusiness coming up later this month, RoboWorld in Seoul in October, DroneWorld in November and iREX in Tokyo in December.

      "content": "GreyOrange, an India and Singapore-based materials handling startup, received $30 million in equity funding to ramp up production of their Butler shelves-to-picker robot system.GreyOrange currently has 300+ employees which it plans to double with this new funding. They have two products: a package sorter and Butler. Butler is a square version of the circular orange-colored robotic system that Amazon acquired from Kiva Systems in 2012. The Kiva process had proven invaluable in speeding up bringing goods from the warehouse, dynamically storing goods for the best access, and to shuttle goods to the pick and pack work stations -- all reasons why Amazon evaluated and then purchased Kiva for their internal use. The Butler version purports to do the same set of tasks and GreyOrange's list of clients are distribution center-based and include Flipkart, the Indian version of Amazon, Amazon India, and Delhivery, an integrator and provider of distribution center systems all over India.Two questions come to mind about the GreyOrange funding:Kiva Systems and Universal Robots were and are still two stars in robotics. They both sold for phenomenal amounts and they were both predominantly funded from their rapidly growing sales.Farhad Manjoo wrote in the NY Times recently about the propensity of startups to stay private. He cited executives not wanting to give up control nor be regularly scrutinized by those that don't really understand the business. This trend is causing valuations to differ for privately held versus publicly held companies (privately held valuations are higher). It is also causing public investors to miss out on the successful companies in this new growth industry.In John Markoff's new book Machines of Loving Grace he describes the principle on which the Kiva system was developed:Kiva Systems had the insight that the most difficult functions to automate in the modern warehouse were ones that required human eyes and hands, like identifying and grasping objects. Without perception and dexterity, robotic systems are limited to the most repetitive jobs, and so Kiva took the obvious intermediate step and built mobile robots that carried items to stationary human workers. Once machine perception and robotic hands become better and cheaper, humans could disappear entirely.Finally, a word about IP (intellectual property, e.g., patents and copyrights). GreyOrange has to be on Amazon's radar for possible IP infringement. I am presuming that GreyOrange has vetted their IP versus Kiva/Amazon and concluded that they are unique enough to not cause legal problems.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "194 Chinese Robot Companies",
      "content": "The robotics industry is booming in China. Companies are deploying thousands of robots in all types of factories, particularly in the auto industry. Chinese companies that manufacture robots and their components are also growing. This article will focus on the 107 makers of those robots.UPDATED 8/17/15: China became the world's largest consumer market of industrial robots for the 2nd consecutive year, according to statistics released by the China Robot Industry Alliance (CRIA). Sales in China increased by 54.6% in 2014 to around 57,000 units, 25% of the global total. Data shows that nearly 17,000 units were made in China with a value of $474M, an increase of 60% from 2013.Various research reports are predicting that more than 250,000 industrial pick and place, painting and welding robots will be purchased and deployed in China by 2019. That figure represents more than the total global sales of all types of industrial robots in 2014! The Chinese government is encouraging the development of an in-country robotics industry because currently 3/4 of all robots purchased are from off-shore companies (albeit some with manufacturing and assembly facilities in China).We have been able to identify 47 Chinese companies and 5 startups that call themselves industrial robot makers, and another 26 which offer to provide integration services and speciality equipment. 34 more provide ancillary services, sensors and components to the robot makers. Overall, 107 Chinese companies are involved in industrial robotics. Many of these new industrial robot makers are producing products which, because of quality, safety and design, will only be acceptable to the Chinese market. In addition to growth in Chinese industrial robotics, progress in the service robotics sector is also healthy. A shining example of the 48 mostly new service robotic companies on the map is Shenzhen DJI Innovations, of quadcopter fame. DJI is projected to sell $1 billion of their devices in 2015. Two other notable growth areas in the service sector are materials handling and the production of unmanned air, sea and ground devices for China's developing space, military and defense industries. The consumer sector is also growing: robotic vacuums and personal/social robots are examples. Last Singles Day, a brand new shopping holiday in China, Alibaba sold over 70,000 Ecovacs robotic vacuum cleaners!The drivers propelling this boom are many and varied:The Robot Report and the research team at Robo-STOX\u2122 have been able to identify 194 companies that make or are directly involved in making robots in China. The CRIA (China Robot Industry Alliance), and other sources, proffer the number to be closer to 400. The Robot Report's Global Map is limited by our own research capabilities, language translation limitations, and scarcity of information about robotics companies and their websites and contact people. We could use your help adding to the map. Please send companies that we have missed (or are new) to info@therobotreport.com.You can explore the map online and filter it in a variety of ways. Use Google's directional and +/- markers on the left of the map to navigate, enlarge, and hone in on an area of interest (or double click near where you want to enlarge). Click on one of the colored markers to get a pop-up window with the name, type, focus, location and a link to the company's website.[Note: the map shows a single entry for the company headquarters regardless how many branches, subsidiaries and factory locations that company might have.]The Filter pull-down menu lets you choose any one of the seven major categories: (1) Industrial robot makers; (2) Service robots used by corporations and governments; (3) Service robots for personal and private use; (4) Integrators; (5) Robotic start-up companies; (6) universities and research labs with special emphasis on robotics; and (7) Ancillary businesses providing engineering, software, components, sensors and other services to the industry.As can be seen from the map at the top of the page, most all of the companies and educational facilities are located on the East Coast or in Central China. Very few are located in the Northeast or in Western China.The research firms predicting dramatic growth for the domestic Chinese robotics industry are also predicting very low-cost devices. Their reports are contradicted by academics, roboticists and others who point out that there are so many new robot manufacturing companies in China that none will be able to manufacture many thousand robots per year and thus benefit from scale. Further, many of the components that comprise a robot are intricate and costly, e.g., reduction gears from Nabtesco, Harmonic Drive and Sumitomo (all Japanese companies). Although a few of the startups are attempting to make reduction gears and other similar devices, the lack of these component manufacturers in China may put a cap on how low costs can go and on how much can be done in-country for the time being. Another negative is that all but auto manufacturers have short product cycles requiring any robots on the line to be extremely flexible. Worker flexibility is still crucial in Chinese manufacturing.In the chart below, the 194 Chinese companies are tabulated by their business type and area of focus.Again, we request your help adding to the map and making it as accurate and up-to-date as possible.

      "content": "$11.2 million to Virtual Incision, a startup developing robotically assisted surgical devices, and another $11 million to Jibo, the company founded by Cynthia Breazeal of HRI fame from the MIT Media Lab. Money continues to flow to robotics. Jibo, Inc., the company behind the social robot Jibo which last year had the successful $3.7 million Indiegogo crowdfunding, is now focusing their partnering to those that are strategic and concentrate on the Asian market. The lineup of investors in this $11M add-on to the previous $25.3M Series A round includes:With this $11M, Jibo has now raised $38.6M and has announced a production schedule beginning in late Fall 2015 and through Spring 2016 for crowdfunded orders and preorders. Additional orders are waitlisted. It's easy to see that this round of funding focuses on the a serious expansion into the Asian market - the same marketplace where SoftBank and partners Alibaba and Foxconn are bringing their Pepper robot to market and NTT and Vstone are readying their Sota companion tabletop robot to compete. All the telcom giants want to participate in this new trend toward home social robots and devices to get the monthly Internet service slice of the pie. SoftBank is charging $100 per month for Pepper's connection services.Virtual Incision Corp., a developer of an in vivo mini-robot surgical device enabling minimally invasive colon and abdominal procedures, received $11.2 million which brings their total funding to date to $25.7M. Virtual Incision's robotically-assisted surgical device is an investigational device and is not commercially available.In their press release VIC said the funds will be used for a feasibility study on the use of the company\u2019s miniaturized robotically assisted surgical technology for colon resection, a procedure performed to treat patients with lower gastrointestinal diseases such as diverticulitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. \u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "June-July fundings, IPOs and acquisitions",
      "content": "Below are recaps of the fourteen June and July fundings, IPOs and acquisitions for robot and robotics related companies, followed by a thoughtful piece by Farhad Manjoo of the NY Times about why start-ups are staying private. Also 3 earlier fundings just discovered.UPDATED 7/29/15 to add Rethink Robotics April add-on to an earlier Series D funding, $3M to Squadrone System to launch their HEXO+ flying camera, and Siemens' investment in Magazino in May.Surgical device maker Transenterix raised $50 million from an IPO and market switch which transferred their stock from the over-the-counter market to the special small-cap MKT Exchange on the NYSE. This followed on the heels of Corindus Vascular Robotics which raised $42 million in late May by offering 11 million shares at $3.80 and then went public on the same NYSE MKT exchange.SoftBank along with O'Reilly AlphaTech and shasta Ventures invested $20M into Fetch Robotics which recently demonstrated their Fetch and Freight robot system at ICRA in May. Also at ICRA was the Amazon picking challenge. Both Fetch and the challenge are focused on the material handling aspects of warehousing and distribution center operations and represent a hot area for capital expenditures in those applications.Foxconn and Alibaba invested $118M each into SoftBank Robotics in a strategic move sure to have long-term ramifications. Foxconn and Alibaba's combined investment equals a 40% share of the new SoftBank Robotic Group, an entity which holds the France-based Aldebaran Robotics, the new Pepper social robot, and the Pepper SDK software group.Orbotix, the maker of the Sphero line of toys, received $45M in equity funding from the Walt Disney Company and Mercato Partners bringing their total funding to date to $80M. Disney and Sphero have a new Star Wars game app.Robotic flatbread maker Zimplistic got $11.5M from two venture funds: a Southeast Asia private equity firm, NSI Ventures, and the venture arm of Robert Bosch GmbH, the global supplier of technology products and services for the auto and home. Zimplistic, the Singapore and Silicon Valley startup behind the Rotimatic, the home flatbread maker, sold over $5 million at their launch last year. Today, they have a backlog of $72M in orders and over 5,000 distribution partnership requests. Zymergen, which integrates robots, big data, and software to unlock the potential of biology of future materials, received $44 million in funding from Data Collective, True Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and other VCs.Squadrone System, a startup composed of a team experienced in movie production, launched their HEXO+ flying follow-me camera to a very successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014 raising $1.3M from 2,300 supporters. In June, 2015, they secured a $3M investment from Living Water Investment Corp., and they have received loans from a series of French banks bringing their total funding to $5M.Teledyne invested capital to increase their ownership stake to 37% in Ocean Aero, the San Diego based unmanned naval systems startup. The amount of the transaction was undisclosed. Ocean Aero is developing autonomous, highly persistent, wind/electric unmanned vessels for surveillance, research and oil and gas monitoring. Rethink Robotics added $13.4M to their Series D round of funding in April (the original Series D was for $24.6M in December) and added a new participant: GE Ventures.Siemens, the conglomerate, in May, bought 49.9% of Magazino GmbH, a German materials handling startup, for an undisclosed amount. A spokesperson said \"the new funding from Siemens is big enough to allow the growth of the team to up to 30 people (mostly high profile with phD or even Professors) within the next weeks and beyond that next year. Additionally the investment enables us to grow rapidly for the next three years without any further financing needs.\"Vecna, a robotic mobility provider for hospitals and warehouses, acquired VGo, a provider of mobile telepresence devices, for an undisclosed amount. Similar to the strategic acquisition of Segway by Chinese Ninebot - a situation where Segway was suing Ninebot for IP infringement - and where Segway's IP passed on to Ninebot, VGo's IP, which has already undergone thorough court vetting, passes its IP to Vecna in the acquisition.Bimba Manufacturing acquired Intek Products for an undisclosed amount. Both are American companies that manufacture actuators and other automation and motion components for robot makers and others.Video compression and image processing semiconductor manufacturer Ambarella acquired VisLab, a lab within the University of Parma focused on perception systems, for $30M. VisLab has developed computer vision and intelligent control systems for automotive and other commercial applications including ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) and several generations of autonomous vehicle driving systems including \u201cPorter,\u201d the autonomous vehicle that made a 13,000 km trip from Italy to China in 2010. Canadian sUAS developer Draganfly Innovations was acquired by TRACE Live Networks, a California company with operations in Calgary and Toronto. No information was available as to the amount of the transaction. TRACE said that the two companies will collaborate on the further advancement of the TRACE Live Network auto-follow devices and live-streaming platform. They will also initiate development of several commercial applications for TRACE's visually intelligent SmartCamera technology.I've excerpted a few paragraphs from the NY Times article \"As More Tech Start-Ups Stay Private, So Does the Money\" by Farhad Manjoo. The whole article is worth reading.Something strange has happened in the last couple of years: The initial public offering of stock has become d\u00e9class\u00e9. For start-up entrepreneurs and their employees across Silicon Valley, an initial public offering is no longer a main goal. Instead, many founders talk about going public as a necessary evil to be postponed as long as possible because it comes with more problems than benefits.\u201cIf you can get $200 million from private sources, then yeah, I don\u2019t want my company under the scrutiny of the unwashed masses who don\u2019t understand my business,\u201d said Danielle Morrill, the chief executive of Mattermark, a start-up that organizes and sells information about the start-up market. \u201cThat\u2019s actually terrifying to me.\u201d...Silicon Valley\u2019s sudden distaste for the I.P.O. \u2014 rooted in part in Wall Street\u2019s skepticism of new tech stocks \u2014 may be the single most important psychological shift underlying the current tech boom. Staying private affords start-up executives the luxury of not worrying what outsiders think and helps them avoid the quarterly earnings treadmill.During a recent presentation for Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s limited partners \u2014 the institutions that give money to the venture firm \u2014 Marc Andreessen, the firm\u2019s co-founder, told the journalist Dan Primack that he had never seen a sharper divergence in how investors treat public- and private-company chief executives. \u201cThey tell the public C.E.O., \u2018Give us the money back this quarter,\u2019 and they tell the private C.E.O., \u2018No problem, go for 10 years,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Andreessen said....At some point this tension will be resolved. \u201cPrivate valuations will not forever be higher than public valuations,\u201d said Mr. Levitan, of Maveron. \u201cSo the question is, Will private markets capitulate and go down or will public markets go up?\u201dIf the private investors are wrong, employees, founders and a lot of hedge funds could be in for a reckoning. But if they\u2019re right, it will be you and me wearing the frown \u2014 the public investors who missed out on the next big thing.\u00ab Return to The Robot ReportFrank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report and co-founder of ROBO Global which has developed a tracking index for the robotics industry, the ROBO Global\u2122 Robotics & Automation Index.

      "title": "People.io data rewards app gets Telefonica co-branding push",
      "content": "London based People.io has taken its first steps outside the UK, expanding its data sharing rewards platform into Germany -- where it's launched a co-branded version of the app with carrier o2 (called o2 Get), targeting the latter's ~24 million customers.The People.io app is also available to download via the App Store and Google Play, and o2 parent company Telefonica Germany will also be pushing the apps across its full market footprint of 44M customers. The telco link follows People.ioIn going through the telco's Wayra Germany accelerator last year. They say they're the first Wayra-backed startup to launch a co-branded product with Telefonica.\"By co-branding with o2 we benefit from a respected and well known consumer brand which... gives us a fast track to scale; meaning we can focus on creating a great product experience that delivers on our vision to give people ownership of their data,\" says co-founder Nicholas Oliver.\"Our decision to launch in Germany was driven by their strong, consumer-centric data privacy laws. This meant we were focussed on building a product that could meet even the most stringent data privacy laws with a view to further market expansion.\"Oliver says the team is expecting to get around 250,000 downloads in the next 6 months in Germany; increasing to just under 1 million by the end of the first year.The startup is apparently working with around a dozen telcos across 35 markets at this point -- although it remains to be seen how many of those conversations will turn into fully fledged co-branded app efforts.In o2 Germany's case, People.io's philosophy around user data ownership clearly meshes with a Telefonica strategic push to give data back to users aimed at fostering customer loyalty.We first covered People.io back in January 2016, when it had just launched a beta version in Shoreditch, giving locals the chance to share personal data in exchange for building up credits to redeem against digital services like streaming music. It's since scaled out to be UK wide.The core idea is to flip the notion that Internet users have to 'pay' to use 'free' products by having their personal data covertly and persistently harvested by these services. Instead, the platform aims to give people an incentive to share data willingly with it, for targeted ad purposes, rewarding them for sharing data with credits to redeem against different services (and by not sharing their data directly with others).The People.io app is broadly aimed at 18 to 25 year olds for now, offering a familiar Tinder-style swipe interface for them to respond to questions about their likes and dislikes to start inputting personal data into the platform. They can also choose to connect other data sources, such as their email account, in order to share more info -- with increased rewards for sharing more.Advertisers are able to target marketing messages at People.io users via the platform, but the startup says users' data is never shared directly with third parties. And the further pledge is that users can delete their account at any point -- which immediately and permanently erases all their data.Oliver describes the platform as \"a firewall for people\", and reckons Europe's incoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will have a serious impact on how the ad tech industry operates  regionally, because it gives consumers greater control over how their data is used. The GDPR is due to come into force in May 2018, and includes tough penalties for compliance failures, changing the risks associated with collecting and processing EU citizens' personal data.While People.io's initial product pays data sharers for viewing targeted ads -- typically redeemed against gift cards for Amazon, Starbucks and iTunes, according to Oliver, with an option to donate credits earned as cash to charity currently also in testing -- its wider vision is around expanding into paid services of its own; utilizing users' data to offer them the ability to pay to enhance other digital services they use, without having to lose control of their information.\"This might apply to health and fitness, connected home or even productivity apps and experiences,\" he explains. \"Our advertising feature(s) are really just phase one of a far bigger product vision. It provides us with a familiar consumer experience that allows us to develop the initial relationship with the user. From here, we can then educate them on the value associated to their data and demonstrate why taking ownership of it can benefit them; both financially and through enhanced digital experiences.\"A brief example could be with a Spotify playlist. Having a playlist that dynamically changes your upcoming tracks based on your current context (at work, at home, going running, trying to relax) or mood (stressed, energetic, feel like partying). With People.io -- we'd just tell Spotify 'Nic's at work' or 'Nic is about to go running' -- without sharing any of the data behind that insight. So that means Spotify can do what it does best, without ever needing access to your digital life.\"\"When you consider the future of Conversational interfaces, like Amazon Echo, or chat bots; this type of functionality will become increasingly relevant,\" he adds.At this still early stage, People.io has around 35,000 accounts activated since exiting beta in the UK, with around two-thirds of those characterized as 'monthly actives'.On average, Oliver says users engage with the app between two to three times a week. While the platform gets around half a million user interactions per month at this point.He says the startup is currently raising investment to support \"continued momentum and growth into other key markets\". Investors to date include Nick Robertson, founder of ASOS; Thomas Hoegh, founder of Lovefilm; and Founders' Factory, the accelerator founded by Brent Hoberman and backed by Guardian Media Group.European markets are a priority, thanks to the pro-privacy regulatory environment, but Oliver says the team is hoping to expand into the first non-EU market by the end of the year. \"The US is certainly a market that we're keeping an eye on,\" he adds.",

      "title": "VentureFriends closes EUR20M fund to invest in Greek software startups",
      "content": "A tiny bit more VC money sloshing around Europe. This time it's the turn of Greece-based VC fund VentureFriends, which is announcing the final closing of a EUR20 million fund to invest in Greek software and \"high tech\" startups at the seed stage. The two Partners of the fund are Apostolos Apostolakis and George Dimopoulos, with Stefanos Katsimpas also acting as a senior Associate.Over half the money was raised last year and I'm told VentureFriends has already done about 20 investments, but is keen to get the word out that Greek entrepreneurs have another investor to approach. Interestingly, unlike a lot of local European VCs, the firm's 40 or so LPs are all private. In other words, if I understand correctly, there is no tax-payer money being gambled here.Specifically, Apostolakis says the fund will be investing amounts between EUR250-500,000 and can follow on up to a total of 1 million. It is targeting startups with strong teams and generating a little revenue, with e-commerce/e-marketplaces, SaaS, AdTech, and on-demand services remaining a focus.\"We want to see network effects or high technology,\" he tells me. \"We look for innovating hustlers solving big and important need-to-solve problems\".In case you aren't familiar with Apostolakis' work, he previously co-founded e-shop.gr, the first e-tailer in Greece, and in 2011 he co-founded e-food, a food delivery marketplace acquired in 2015 by Delivery Hero, providing a major exit for the Greek startup ecosystem.He's also an active angel investor, including recently investing in Doctoranytime, the doctor booking app launched in Belgium by ex-Take Eat Easy team members.Notably, he and Dimopoulo were also among the first angel investors in Taxibeat, the taxi app that sold to Daimler in February.",

      "title": "Startup step-by-step: Why I'm doing another startup",
      "content": "The desire to create is a hard one to kill. I've had it all my life, from the comic books and music I made with my grade school friend Rick to the books I wrote and tried to write to the projects I built over the years. Now it's become easier and, in a way, harder, to make something meaningful online, so after shutting down one startup last year, I've decided to work on another one, Jaywalk, with a new team.My first startup was a deep learning experience. I learned about entrepreneurship firsthand, experienced the ups and downs (mostly downs) of building, raising and, ultimately, folding a company. I watched one friendship bend and another break under the unique pressures of dreaming something and watching the dream choke.It sucked.After all, I thought I was special. I've written about startups for a long time and I was flip and funny and ignorant of the pain people have to go through in order to make something real. Sure, I had an academic understanding of the topic  --  seed rounds, angels, development, media pushes  --  but I had no real idea what all that looked like in practice. I like to think that's changed and at the very least I've been given a more sober vision of the future.The tech media have made startups seem like a real blast. You hang with your friends, write a little code and cash a check. When you're young you can survive on ramen and heavy metal and you walk away unscathed, the hero of an action movie walking away from an exploding helicopter.But the truth is far more interesting. First the average and median age of most U.S. startup founders is 39. While we mostly hear of the young founder straddling the world, what you rarely hear about is the older founder with years under their belt with an idea that will change an industry that they understand implicitly. The best startup founders don't \"disrupt,\" per se. They improve. The byproduct of that aggregated improvement is disruption.Building things has also made me more compassionate. I used to run around the world yelling at people to quit their jobs, to get things done, to move fast and break things. No longer. I understand the value of a side hustle and the importance of research and planning. I also understand how rare startup success is and I try, in my own way, to assuage the grief of a new founder in a distant city who is finding out, as I did, that the world is cold and unfeeling and uninterested in your idea until, one morning, it isn't. It's the expectation of the breakthrough that has to sustain you through arguments, failures and deafening silence.I understand the dangers and benefits of VC, the pride that some people have at bootstrapping, and the importance of the entrepreneurial spirit in small towns and cities. I understand why this process is seen as a ticket out. When I visit different places and meet startup founders, I try to be nicer and more helpful rather than dismissive. I've finally taken to heart the old adage, \"Let us be kind to one another, for most of us are fighting a hard battle.\"I'm lucky that I've surrounded myself with smart people. Our latest startup, Jaywalk, brought me back together with my longtime college friend Rich, the guy with whom I worked on my first startup. We also have a solid team at an accelerator we joined in Boulder, Boomtown, and we're slowly building out our dev and UX team in order to create an app that truly rewards you for walking around and discovering new things in your neighborhood. It's something that's very dear to me for a few reasons, namely because it's almost impossible to get my kids to leave the house for a walk if I tell them we're going to the park but far easier if I tell them we'll get a cookie on the way back. We want to get people off their pocket computers and back into the world.I gave a talk about a year ago about how I felt after my first startup failed. It was called \"This is fine.\" I based it on that comic of the dog in the fiery coffee house. I focused on this quote:\"Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames.\"\n-- RumiThis quote really bothered me. It was some serious spiritual bullshit. In the doldrums of failure, I saw it as a warning: Set your life on fire and watch what happens, sucker. That's what I did. I quit a great full-time job, put my family at risk, broke bonds I had with people I loved. And Rumi is here telling me to light the pyre higher. You'll know your enemies by how they fan your flames is what I thought he was saying.I was wrong.I realized that this quote meant something entirely different. It meant that you had to find the right people to help you grow, to help you expand, to help you get the most out of your adventure. You had to find people to fan your flames. Those people helped you burn brighter, not burn up faster.I found those people in my family, in my friends, in my online community. I found those people in the folks at the accelerator who placed early bets on us and in the folks I built stuff with.I've spent the past two decades in my attic, writing. For me, building was always a solitary endeavor. Those friends helped me finally get out of my proverbial attic and I started building with others. And it's that effort, the effort of creating in concert, that truly defines us as a species. My friends didn't fan my flames to burn me out. They fanned them to help me light up the dark.This is a long way of saying I'm building something new. I'll keep you posted, and let me know if you need anything.",

      "title": "Giant companies that won't buy your startup",
      "content": "Huge companies in fast-changing, technology-intensive businesses buy startups. After all, they have the money and need fresh entrepreneurial talent to tap new markets and stay abreast of disruption.That's the collective wisdom about M&A in venture capital and startup circles. It's also how the venture business survives. Though IPOs may get more attention, acquisitions account for the vast majority of startup exits and a majority of venture returns.But what if the common wisdom isn't true? What if companies could do perfectly well adjusting to changing conditions, beating competitors and sustaining enormous market capitalizations without buying scrappy startups?To delve into that hypothesis, we used Crunchbase data to help assemble a list of the least acquisitive large-cap companies. The primary focus was technology companies, but we included other sectors because leaders in retail, consumer products, shipping and pretty much any other industry also invest heavily in tech.The resultant list shows that many companies with reputations as innovators actually don't do much M&A. Some did in the past, but have cut back or stopped in recent years. Others have never shown an appetite for acquisitions.Here are some of the most recognizable names on our list of big companies least likely to buy your startup.Netflix seems like the kind of company that would do a lot of acquiring. It has a valuation around $60 billion, an innovative, risk-taking corporate culture and investors who are comfortable with the company trading at a high multiple relative to earnings. Yet, according to Crunchbase data, the Los Gatos, Calif.-based streaming video giant has never bought a startup (at least not a disclosed purchase).While Netflix doesn't buy startups, it does have a history of spending generously on content and licensing deals. Earlier this month, the company struck its first licensing deal in China with the streaming platform iQIYI. It's also entered into licensing deals with a long list of Hollywood studios, including NBC Universal and others.Shares of the graphics chipmaker have been on a tear for the past year, and the company's market value recently surged past $60 billion.Yet the Silicon Valley company has only made one acquisition in the past six years, after a prior pace of about a deal a year. The last time it made a disclosed acquisition was 2015, and that was a tiny deal, paying $3.75 million to acquire seed-funded cloud gaming startup TransGaming.Between 2002 and 2011, Crunchbase shows Nvidia making about one acquisition a year, including some large deals. For its last big purchase, in 2011, the company bought Icera, a developer of mobile broadband modem technology, for $367 million.It's hard to make a case that not buying startups has been bad for Nvidia's competitiveness. The company posted a 50 percent revenue surge for the second straight quarter in its last earnings report. Its net income for the past year totaled nearly $1.7 billion.Texas Instruments is one of those companies that no one in Silicon Valley talks about. Perhaps that's because it's based in Dallas, has been around since the 1950s and has a brand famously associated with 1970s calculators. Nonetheless, Texas Instruments is a big player in the semiconductor space, with a valuation around $80 billion and profit of about $8 billion a year. It's also not very acquisitive these days.The last time Texas Instruments made a disclosed acquisition, according to Crunchbase data, was 2011, when it bought National Semiconductor for $6.5 billion. Maybe TI is still digesting that giant purchase. Before buying National Semiconductor, TI was reasonably acquisitive, buying about 10 companies from 2002 to 2011, including some venture-backed startups. But it hasn't been back to the table in a long time.Applied Materials is another company that used to do acquisitions fairly often but hasn't made a new one in years. Like Texas Instruments, Applied's last big acquisition was enormous. The company paid $4.9 billion in 2011 for Varian Semiconductor, a developer of semiconductor processing equipment. For a company with a market capitalization north of $40 billion, Applied has never been particularly acquisitive. But six years is a long dry spell.Although it hasn't been buying startups, Applied Materials has been investing in them. Its corporate VC arm, Applied Ventures, has participated in at least 46 funding rounds since 2006, including several in the past year.We all know Home Depot sells flooring, drills and other tools; therefore, it isn't expected to be snapping up quantum computing startups. But a lot of startup innovation happens in retail, as well, so one might expect a retailer valued at $180 billion to buy a few venture-backed companies to stay competitive.That hasn't been the case. According to Crunchbase, the last time Home Depot snagged a startup was five years ago. The hardware retail chain bought BlackLocus, an early-stage developer of pricing software that had previously raised a couple million dollars. The same year, it also bought Redbeacon, a site for getting price quotes and finding professionals to work on one's home.Other companies with massive valuations that aren't much into buying startups these days include UPS, Procter & Gamble and Citigroup. All have the financial resources for more M&A, just not the appetite.One conclusion to take away from track records of these non-acquisitive companies is that buying startups may be more a strategic preference than a necessity. It's obvious many large-cap tech companies -- Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Facebook, to name a few -- have a history of both acquiring a lot of startups and sustaining massive valuations. But clearly, that's not the only way to stay on top.",

      "title": "Barry, Dave, Bob? More startups 'humanize' their offerings",
      "content": "Naming companies is a daunting task, as anyone who does it for a living can attest. \"It's difficult to criticize a name,\" says S.B. Master, a Berkeley, Ca.-based founder who has launched two naming companies in her career, one of which is nearly 30 years old. \"From choosing a name, to getting a team to agree to it, to clearing that name from a trademark and URL and social media standpoint -- it's a pain.\" By \"triangulating around these difficulties, people end up someplace, which is better than no place,\" she adds sympathetically.Interestingly, the place where a growing number of startups seems to be landing is on a person's name that may have nothing to do with their business.This week, for example, a year-old, L.A.-based company called Dave raised $3 million for an app that predicts upcoming expenses and alerts users if their bank balance is low. Its founders say that people often ask friends or family for short-term loans to cover shortfalls; they want their customers to think of their startup as a pal who's also looking out for their best interests.Another company, U.K.-based Hibob (for \"Hi, Bob\"), raised $17.5 million in Series A funding this week for its cloud-based HR and benefits platform.Other companies have taken the same tack in recent years, including an app called Barry that lets users save full-length webpages, the tech-focused health insurance company Oscar and Clara, the virtual assistant company, whose name probably makes the most sense of the bunch, given that assistants have historically been actual people.Indeed, assigning tech startups human names dates back at least five years. Alex Friedman, president of Ruckus Marketing in New York, points to Casper, the mattress and bedding company whose brand evokes the friendly ghost who helps keep his friends safe while they sleep. There's also Harry's, the shaving gear company whose name evokes, of course, hair. And founders have named companies after themselves for as long as anyone can remember, in tech or otherwise. The online education company Lynda.com is named after co-founder Lynda Weinman. Philz Coffee is named after founder Phil Jaber.Still, assigning companies human names simply to make tech products more approachable is a  newer trend, and it's poised to escalate quickly in the age of artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, branding experts can't quite agree on whether it's an approach to emulate or avoid.For his part, Friedman doesn't think a company's name is nearly as big a deal as everything else that goes into supporting that brand. \"The name itself is not the brand,\" he says. \"It's an icon or component of what a company wants to build for itself, a focal point for how it's building its business. I say this a lot, but the name is a lot less important than the weight that many people give it.\"Whether it's Bob or Bill or Casper, he says, what's more important is \"what you're selling, who the customer is and how much money you have behind you. Without money, making a name mean something is difficult. If you don't have the capital, you won't get very far.\"The view runs contrary to that of David Placek, a Sausalito, Ca.-based naming expert whose iconic work was profiled years ago in The New Yorker, and who thinks names work best when there's a great story around them. He points to Tesla, named after inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist and futurist Nikola Tesla. \"It's an authentic association and it's elegant.\"\"Compare 'Tesla' to 'Dave' or 'Bob,' \" Placek says, pausing, trying to find something positive to say about the latter brands. \"Dave is the stronger idea; that 'v' has some energy to it. Bob seems a little informal for an HR function.\"If you were to ask us, we'd say to skip the trend and opt for something original. (Look, we still remember the sentient computer HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey. We also recall that things didn't go so well for the people in HAL's life.)Don't expect the fashion to fade away anytime soon, however. If there's a consistent trend, says Placek, it's that \"people try to replicate success.\" Because Harry's and Casper are seemingly performing well, other companies will naturally think it's worth a shot, too.The good news, says Master, the Berkeley-based pro, is that, \"in general, a bad name is not going to kill an intrinsically good product or company. The excellence of the offering can overcome many naming weaknesses. Unless it's unpronounceable. Or forgettable. Or you get sued. A lot of founders,\" she says, \"have overcome suboptimal names.\"",

      "content": "Today, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai released the broad strokes of his plan to abandon consumer protections to the benefit of large corporate players in the telecommunications industry.While major telecom companies are looking forward to Pai's FCC makeover, the same can't be said for everyone else in tech. After Pai's announcement, a group of more than 800 names in tech sent Pai a business-minded denouncement of his plans to strip away the rules that shape net neutrality.For tech companies that aren't telecom behemoths, the crux of the argument is this:\"... the success of America's startup ecosystem depends on more than improved broadband speeds. We also depend on an open Internet--including enforceable net neutrality rules that ensure big cable companies can't discriminate against people like us. We're deeply concerned with your intention to undo the existing legal framework.Without net neutrality, the incumbents who provide access to the Internet would be able to pick winners or losers in the market. They could impede traffic from our services in order to favor their own services or established competitors. Or they could impose new tolls on us, inhibiting consumer choice. Those actions directly impede an entrepreneur's ability to \"start a business, immediately reach a worldwide customer base, and disrupt an entire industry.\" Our companies should be able to compete with incumbents on the quality of our products and services, not our capacity to pay tolls to Internet access providers.\"The letter, spearheaded by Y Combinator, Techstars and Engine represents a massive swath of tech's net neutrality supporters, from investors and incubators to startups and code schools. The full letter is embedded below.",

      "content": "Physical tracking in shops has been a global trend since at least 2013. Using a cell phone's location data and video monitoring, retailers have been tracking customers' movements through stores in an effort to regain some of the ground lost to the online retail experience.At least, that's the argument from stores. And now fast food restaurants are picking up the rallying cry.On the back of nearly 20,000 fast food locations using its customer-tracking technologies in stores, the Los Angeles-based startup Sense360 has raised $7 million in its first round of financing.The mobile-sensing technologies that are at the heart of Sense360's technology track location and survey data from customers to sell to fast food stores customer feedback (both voluntary and involuntary) on what's working and what's not working at locations around the country.Investors in the round included Firstmark, Qualcomm Ventures and Los Angeles-based Upfront Ventures.The company also established an advisory board with heavy hitters from fast food restaurants, like Joel Aach, a former vice president at Darden Restaurants (the company behind The Olive Garden restaurant chain and others); and Huw Griffiths, the global chief product officer at the marketing firm Universal McCann.Sense360 isn't the only company that's looking at customer behavior. BirdEye raised $25 million in February to not only analyze customer behavior and feedback but also to provide a sort of relationship management that the company said can help convert negative sentiment into positive experiences.Both companies are building on the foundation laid by other startups, like ShopperTrak, Retail Next, Nomi and Prism Skylabs.Aware of the pushback that has shuttered a number of location-tracking services in higher-end retail outlets, Sense360 chief executive Eli Portnoy takes pains to highlight the care with which Sense360 approaches customer data.\"We only work with apps that have a legitimate reason to collect location data and all participating apps must get user consent to acquire and share the location data,\" Portnoy wrote to me in an email. \"We also do not collect personally identifiable information. In fact, we intentionally obscure sensitive data like wifi access points so that we cannot access that information, ensuring added privacy.\"Portnoy said that the company never shares individual data with third parties, and that all reporting is provided in an aggregated format.That means Sense360 isn't sharing data, just access to the dashboard that allows restaurants to view the data that's been collected.",

Their system, which will be installed in delis and fast food restaurants, lets you refill your water bottle for free with filtered tap water that should, in theory, be better than the swill you currently get from water fountains.The founders, Jason Pessel, Andrew Betlyon, and Patrick Connorton, first worked on the idea during the 2015 Think Beyond Plastic accelerator but they've been lifelong friends. They bootstrapped the first few stations and won grants from NYU and the 2016 New York StartUp! Business Plan Competition.

The app shows where Reefill stations are hidden and you pay $1.99 a month for access.The system also maintains user data and can tell merchants and potential advertisers about popular places in the city. Finally, it keeps you from having to ask the folks behind the counter for free water. Pessel came up with the idea when he was walking through New York and couldn't find a single place to refill his reusable bottle. Out of this frustration a product was born.While it doesn't seem like much - a water fountain connected to an app, basically - Pessel notes that 50% of all bottled water comes from the tap anyway so this just cuts out the plastic-producing and, at $2 a bottle in New York, expensive middlemen.",

      "content": "Recharge, a two-year-old, San Francisco-based company whose app enables users to book a stay in a hotel for just 66 cents a minute, is opening in select New York hotels today, after testing its service over the last year in San Francisco.The company has also raised an undisclosed amount of funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, the corporate venture arm of airline JetBlue, which began providing seed funding to early-stage tech, travel and hospitality startups roughly a year ago.Recharge's earlier investors include Binary Capital, Floodgate, entrepreneur Rick Marini, Eniac VC, Expansion VC, investors Scott and Cyan Banister and early Google engineer Harry Cheung. They'd provided the company with $2.3 million in seed funding as of June of last year.Recharge is an interesting startup, one that we've half-kiddingly compared in the past with hotels that have long rented rooms by the hour for illicit activities. Given the caliber of the hotels with which it's partnering, however, it's seemingly time to rethink its place in the world. In New York, customers can now book rooms at The Pierre, W New York, The Knickerbocker and 1 Hotel Central. In San Francisco, it has struck partnerships with 15 properties, from the downtown Hilton hotel to the five-star hotel Taj Campton Place.According to co-founder and CEO Emmanuel Bamfo, Recharge, which has been used by at least 25,000 people to date, has several primary use cases. These include business travelers who may want to freshen up before heading into a meeting; families who might be doing some shopping and dining and need a place to relax; and local commuters who don't have the time or inclination to ride home between work and evening engagements.Recharge's partnership with JetBlue is purely financial for now, but Bamfo sees a day, too, when airlines use Recharge as a perk to offer for first-class travelers. You can imagine the business traveler whose flight is delayed being given a Recharge voucher, for example.According to the 10-person company, the average stay is two hours. Customers of its most expensive hotels pay $3 a minute for the service, money that it shares with the hotel. Bamfo says the revenue split depends on the day and the time of month. (Hotels are always trying to maximize RevPAR, or the revenue pulled in from each available room.)Bamfo also says that 75 percent of the people who've tried the service so far have used it more than once. \"We have a lot of recurrent customers who use it several times a week, and sometimes even more than once in the same day.\" The ultimate idea, he says, is \"to provide a bed, bath and shower at the right price point, no matter where you are in the world.\"For the company to truly scale, one might imagine that subscriptions would need to come into play. Imagine buying a package of, say, 10 hours to stay in hotels in San Francisco or New York to be used within a certain amount of time. Asked about them, Bamfo says there's high demand for such a product, and that subscriptions are likely coming.\"We see a lot of ways to [generate] incremental revenue,\" he says, including hotel subscriptions that include food, massages, even personal trainers. \"There a lot of things we could be, and will be, doing.\"Pictured above, left to right, co-founders Will Johnson, Emmanuel (\"Manny\") Bamfo and Chris Lo.",

      "content": "Ofo, the Chinese bike-sharing startup that recently claimed unicorn status, announced this weekend that it has added Ant Financial as an investor. In a statement posted to its Weibo account, Ofo said that it will work with Ant Financial, an Alibaba affiliate, on Internet and credit card payments and its international expansion plan.The amount of Ofo's new funding from Ant Financial was not disclosed. Just two months ago, Ofo closed a $450 million Series D that it claims raised its valuation to more than a billion dollars. That round was led by DST Global, Matrix China, CITIC, and Didi Chuxing, the largest car-hailing app in China.Ant Financial--the maker of Alipay, China's largest online payment platform--was already one of Ofo's strategic partners. In March, Ofo started using Ant Financial's credit-rating system, called Sesame Credit, to allow users with qualifying scores to rent bikes without having to make a deposit.Having Ant Financial as an ally strengthens Ofo's position against its chief rival Mobike. Both companies are eager to expand beyond China and have been busy lining up strategic partners and investors. Mobike's backers include Tencent, one of Alibaba's biggest competitors, and tech manufacturing giant Foxconn. Tencent makes WeChat Pay, which lags behind Alipay in market share but enjoys the advantage of being integrated into WeChat, the messaging app that is almost ubiquitous among Chinese smartphone users.In its statement, Ofo says it wants to be the world's largest bike rental platform and that it plans to work with Ant Financial to expand into new countries. TechCrunch has contacted both companies for more details.",

      "title": "The death of retail is greatly exaggerated",
      "content": "I've been thinking a lot about retail these days and I've been connecting the dots between the seeming death of retailers like Ralph Lauren and the book industry. In short, we are feeling the seismic echoes of the 2008 crash right now on Main Street and things are both ugly and pretty at the same time.The book industry, like the music industry, nearly imploded when the world stopped spending its disposable income in the last recession. This led to much doom and gloom and it also led to the rise of ebooks which, at the time, cost far less than a paperback or hardback. Therefore power readers, for lack of a better word, ditched bookstores and only those who enjoyed the book buying experience over the convenience of online kept going to bookstores. And, in seemingly an instant, we saw the collapse of Borders and Barnes & Noble and the death of print in America.Or did we?What we actually saw was a collapse of the old distribution models. Further, any time an old distribution model dies there are plenty of folks who complain their specific sky is falling. As a writer I watched magazines get replaced by websites and bookstores replaced by Amazon and publishers replaced by - and this could be good or bad - self publishing. The self publishing jag continued into Medium and, I would argue, most of the writing that once ended up moldering in the back pages of business journals and trade publications is now online. In short, all of the old distribution systems that made a few people lots and lots of money in the old days shut down and the new systems that made a lot of people a little money sprang up.At the same time we saw something amazing. First, paper book sales in general are up as Generation X and beyond begins to fight back against impermanence of culture. Book lovers know the old John Waters quote - \"We need to make books cool again. If you go home with somebody and they don't have books, don't fuck them\" - and they took it to heart. So you have indie bookstores \"booming\" in the same way long-tail blogs are booming and companies like Read Dog Books are offering cute little book boxes that makes receiving a book a treat rather than an exchange. People want paper books because of how they make them feel - special, in-the-know, educated. In short, it's the hipsterization of book retail.Back to the retail doldrums. While there are plenty of reasons malls are dying I would wager that the primary one is that they sell nothing that the average young person wants, especially given all of the choice on the Internet. The beloved brands of old - Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Gap - are stale and they were initially usurped by American Apparel and then fully shattered by upstarts like American Giant, Supreme, and the rest of that Massdrop/Acryonym/Facebook/RageOn world that brings custom fashion to you at a discount (or, in some cases, a decided non-discount). But the problem is that each of these highly sought-after and popular brands are available electronically and anyone - from a kid in Skopje to a tactical jacket lover in Fresno - has access to wacky fashion that was once available only to the New York/London/Paris/Tokyo crowd or the Griswolds in European Vacation.So again, as in the world of books, the long tail is eating the old and decrepit body. But the long tail again does something clever. The key, then, is for the startup to fill that niche with cool stuff that people want and that is available down the street and not around the world.What happens next? Exactly what is happening in books. The experience of clothes buying, the micro-retail experience of finding something only you know about, will become far more important. When everyone can get Yeezys online, finding a special pair of blaze orange ones made of carbon fiber and Japanese denim that are only available at a tiny shop in Denver will be the new driving force back to retail. Retail isn't dying, it's changing.Let the malls implode. Young retailers will remake them in their own image, gutting the old Gap stores and putting in a coffee shop. Large buildings will be repurposed into markets and micro-retail will replace maxi-retail. And the process will repeat - small becomes big which topples and the small rise again. While the seismic effects of retail death are real and dangerous in the short term I'm optimistic enough to bet on the small scale in the long term.And, maybe in the next ten years, someone like John Waters will tell the world that if you go home with someone who doesn't own a one-of-a-kind, wildly unique P24 HD Gabardine Articulated re-cut staple military style trouser you shouldn't sleep with them.",

      "content": "This is going to be a lot of fun. MIXhalo was founded by Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger and the startup is set to reveal its first product at Disrupt NY 2017. And Mike is bringing some other famous friends to help.MIXhalo has developed a way to distribute audio to a crowd -- like at a concert -- in a way, they say, is even better than what the musicians hear on stage. And there seem to be significant broader applications for the tech, too.Founder Mike Einziger enlisted the help of Pharrell Williams (a MIXhalo advisor & investor) to show off what the company has developed in special presentation at Disrupt NY. They are set to take the main Disrupt stage at the close of the show, just prior to when we announce the winner of Startup Battlefield. And yes, they will be performing a special musical performance for the audience.The event is open to all Disrupt attendees and it will be streamed live like the rest of the conference. But only those at the venue will be able to experience the MIXhalo technology firsthand.So, obviously, we're thrilled to have MIXhalo at the show.Since the first Disrupt, TechCrunch has strived to showcase startups upending traditional paradigms. This is mostly done through chats on the stage and Startup Battlefield, where a couple dozen startups compete each Disrupt for $50,000 and loads of press. Occasionally, a startup like MIXhalo comes along that is showcased best in a different format.Viv was no different. Founded by Dag Kittlaus, who also founded the company that developed Siri, the startup launched with a demo at Disrupt NY 2016 and was acquired by Samsung later in the year.MIXhalo joins a full agenda for Disrupt NY 2017. From the NYT's Mike Thompson to Facebook's Fidji Simo to New York's own Derek Jeter, the three-day show is packed.Registered Disrupt attendees will receive more information about this demo during the conference.General admission tickets and exhibit packages are still available for purchase. The show runs May 15 to May 17. Students can get tickets at a lower price here and additional Hackathon tickets will be released shortly. We're excited to bring Disrupt to New York City for the seventh time and hope you can make the show.",

Sure, Canada may tower over the United States in physical size, but many countries of similar stature -- G7 nations, for example -- dismiss the Great White North as nothing more than America's top hat.This is a mistake.Canada, with nine percent of the world's forests, is a land of plenty. As well as an enviable array of natural resources, Canada also boasts incredible support for entrepreneurs, both homegrown and international. Many household names, such as Slack, Hootsuite and Shopify -- which may be mistakenly considered as U.S. products -- hail from north of the border. This proves Canada is capable of delivering on startup success.And it's no surprise that startups excel in the country. Sure, there is less access to VC funding and the persuasive call of Canada's southern neighbor, but the Canadian government is working hard to build and keep successful startup ecosystems. There is a huge selection of government aid available to small businesses, some of which includes grants that don't have to be paid back.Alongside substantial government backing is Canada's array of world-class universities. The University of Waterloo -- increasingly known as Canada's answer to MIT -- sees incredible numbers go to Silicon Valley every year, while others all over the country produce thousands of talented grads.While eventually losing out to Colombia, Canada was shortlisted as country of the year by The Economist in 2016. The United States' northern neighbor boasts world-class universities and resources to develop talent and, currently, the Canadian dollar is 0.75 cents to the American dollar. This means a highly educated workforce is available for less capital for entrepreneurs all over the world who are ready and willing to make the leap to Canada.Canada has a proud history of technological innovation. Communications company Nortel pushed expansion in the 1970s, bringing talented telecom engineers. In 1983, after a wave of deregulation, Nortel gave way to Bell Canada Enterprise (BCE), which signaled an era of telecom preeminence.If that weren't enough, a year later, in 1984, Research in Motion (RIM), which today is better known as BlackBerry, was founded. While the sun may have set on BlackBerry, the impact of their phones -- and the eponymous messaging service -- has left a lasting impact on cellular phone technology.Fast-forward to the nineties and the Canadian government expanded its Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax incentive program to allow for assistance to companies performing research and development. The legacy of this decision is clearly illustrated by Canada's fervent support of startups in recent times.Since the turn of the new millennium, Canada has been determined to churn out initiative after initiative to support new business. The opening of the MaRS Discovery District in 2005 -- a 1.5-million-square-foot complex located in Toronto's downtown -- provided entrepreneurs with skills via its venture program, and included a network of 1,000 high-potential-growth startups that collectively generated more than $1.3 billion in revenue from 2008-2015. Just two years later, Maple Leaf Angels set up shop in the city center, with a focus on investing in early-stage companies.The MaRS Discovery District in Toronto. Photo courtesy of the MaRS Discovery District.Universities across the country have worked to provide space and support for startups to grow, too. In 2010, Ryerson University founded the Digital Media Zone (DMZ), a combined incubator/accelerator program that has assisted more than 130 companies.In later years, a wave of funding opportunities and globally recognized accelerator programs took root across Canada. The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) deployed $180 million in early-stage startups between 2011 and 2014, while BDC Capital launched its IT Venture Fund II, a fund worth $150 million. 2014 saw U.S. heavyweight The Founder Institute, founded by Adeo Ressi and Jonathan Greechen, open its first Canadian branch. In March 2016, 500 Startups announced its $30 million Canada fund.With such a strong foundation of startup initiatives and technology success, it's no wonder that Canada is in such a strong position now.Despite a population of just 2.8 million, Toronto has been named the most diverse city in the world. About half of its residents were born outside of Canada, and the city is home to 230 nationalities. As Canada's largest city, it's quite naturally the country's commercial, industrial and financial center. It stands to reason that this would make Toronto stand out as the country's biggest tech hub, too.As an example, Toronto-born FreshBooks, an accounting platform for small businesses, has more than 10 million users, and a 43,000-square-foot office in the city, which houses 245 employees. Self-publishing company Wattpad, which lets writers share their work on the platform, has 45 million users worldwide. In November, the company signed a deal with Universal Cable Productions -- the creator of Suits -- with the idea to sift through the stories online to turn the popular ones into TV shows. On-demand platform AskforTask has more than 150,000 taskers, and has doubled its business each year since launching in 2012.The aforementioned MaRS Discovery District is a tower of strength in the city's startup community, too. The four-story brick building takes up almost one city block, and is one of the world's largest innovation hubs, offering funding, mentorship and facilities to the city's creators. Ryerson University's Digital Media Zone incubator is also a resource for early-stage companies worldwide, as are a range of University of Toronto incubators and accelerators. BetaKit, a news publication led by Douglas Soltys that documents Canadian startup news, is also based in the city.As Canada's financial hub, Toronto is home to much of the country's investment. OMERS Ventures has had arguably one of the biggest impacts on the Canadian startup scene. The VC firm backs startups directly, including Shopify, of which the firm owns six percent. Canada also boasts the Venture Capital Action Plan (VCAP) to encourage more Canadian private investors. For every $2 in funding, the government gives another $1 to early-stage companies.Other financial support includes 500 Startup's Canadian fund; the Scientific Research and Experimental Development Program, a federal tax incentive for companies conducting research; and the Industrial Research Assistance Program, which provides entrepreneurs with funding and advisory services to help them develop technology.500 Startups partner Sanjay Singhal. Photo courtesy of the 500 Startups team.Yet despite this, Toronto is yet to birth a homegrown unicorn. While there are up to 4,100 active startups in the city, none are valued at over a billion dollars, and aren't necessarily household names outside the tech scene.Just 60 miles west of Toronto, however, is Waterloo, a small city of 134,000 residents, which holds much of Canada's tech talent. Like San Francisco and the Bay Area, Toronto and Waterloo form a corridor of startup innovation between them. Yet, while Toronto is yet to see any businesses hit that magical unicorn status, Waterloo has.Waterloo is the home of telecoms giant BlackBerry, as well as newer companies that include video optimization platform Vidyard -- which last year raised $35 million in Series C funding -- and Bridgit, a communication app for construction teams that won Google Demo Day: Women's Edition in 2015. Similarly, Shopify, considered one of the country's most successful startups, has an office in Waterloo (as well as offices in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and San Francisco).Waterloo boasts the MIT of Canada -- the University of Waterloo -- which sends talent to startup ecosystems. In fact, every year, recruiters from Apple, Google and Facebook, among others, flock to this Canadian tech hub to onboard new employees; graduates of the University of Waterloo are the second-most-frequently hired in Silicon Valley after students from University of California, Berkeley. The university's students are famously inventive, too. In 2009, Kik Interactive was founded by a group of students who wished to create new technologies for use on mobile smartphones; it has gone on to become an incredible success.The Toronto and Waterloo corridor is sometimes billed -- unsurprisingly -- as the Silicon Valley of the North. Toronto mayor John Tory has said that the Toronto-Waterloo corridor has all the elements for huge success, much of which comes from the quality of universities in the area. The University of Waterloo ranks 24th in the world for computer science and information systems, and the University of Toronto -- one of Canada's most prestigious schools -- ranks 16th.While many tech giants already have a presence in these cities, there are efforts underway to make Toronto-Waterloo rise to the top of the world's tech scene. Following the release of the City of Toronto's Startup Eco-system Strategy in 2015, the city launched StartUp HERE Toronto, a website built and managed by startup influencers to feature startup news and events and put a spotlight on entrepreneurs in the Toronto-Waterloo corridor.Other notable leaders in the region include Sanjay Singhal, partner at 500 Startups; David Crow, advisor at Venture for Canada; Mike McDerment, CEO at FreshBooks; David Ossip, CEO at Ceridian; Matt Golden, founder at Golden Venture Partners; Marcus Daniels, CEO at HIGHLINE vc; Mark Organ, CEO at Influitive; Salim Teja, executive vice president of Ventures at MaRS Discovery District; Lauren Robinson, COO at Highline BETA; Neha Khera, partner at 500 Startups; Heather Payne, CEO at HackerYou; Saadia Muzaffar, founder at TechGirls Canada; Eva Lau, co-founder at Two Small Fish Ventures; Carol Leaman, CEO at Axonify; and Janet Bannister, general partner at Real Ventures.Vancouver is found in British Columbia (BC), amongst the mountains on Canada's west coast. With a population that just exceeds 600,000, the city's easygoing vibe makes it one of the most attractive places in Canada. In fact, Vancouver is rated the fifth city for quality of life in the world by Mercer, the only North American city to make the list.Vancouver residents aren't shy about being in the greenest, and arguably most beautiful, city in Canada. They're also getting pretty good at representing their rising tech scene. The entire province of BC now boasts more than 100,000 people working in the tech sector. Employment in the industry rose 2.9 percent in 2016, compared to the national tech sector's growth at 1.1 percent. Tech in BC employs more people than the mining, oil, gas and forestry industries -- combined.Boasting mountains and ocean just like Silicon Valley, Vancouver also has seen some of the biggest Canadian acquisitions. Vancouver's PlentyofFish, the popular dating website, was purchased by Match Group in 2015 for US$575 million, for example. Even more, Vancouver is home to OMER Ventures-backed Hootsuite -- which is valued at US$1 billion -- as well as everyone's favorite, Slack. Although Slack the company is technically based in San Francisco, CEO Stewart Butterfield also works out of Vancouver, or Vancity as it's often called.In the hopes of fostering more unicorns like Slack and PlentyofFish and fastening BC's startup scene on the world map, the provincial government set up a $100 million fund for early-stage funding in December 2015. Since then, there have been about 14,000 new tech jobs in the province. Also located in Vancouver is the BC Tech Association. Founded in 1993, BC Tech provides growth, talent and advocacy programs to tech companies in the province.Being on the west coast, and therefore the same coast as startup hubs in San Francisco, has its advantages. Startups in the city attract a lot of outside attention, including from Silicon Valley stalwarts. In February of this year, Vancouver-based TIO Networks, which offers online and mobile solutions for bill payments, and processed more than US$7 billion in fiscal 2016, was acquired by PayPal for $304 million. Similarly, Kickstarter opened its first office outside of the United States in the same month, after acquiring Vancouver-based startup Huzza.Traction Conference, hosted by Launch Academy and Boast Capital, is one of a number of popular conferences in the city, and, according to BetaKit's Jessica Galang, puts an emphasis on helping startups learn actionable ways to accelerate their businesses. Cube Business Media, led by Mark Stephenson and Dave Tyldesley, is another organization hosting events throughout the city.Like Toronto and Waterloo, Vancouver boasts world-class universities, such as the University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University. SFU Innovates is a program from the latter, which seeks to build and support innovation and entrepreneurship across the university. It has so far contributed $1.3 billion to BC's economy. Similarly, UBC's Startup Weekend event inspires would-be founders to get set up within 54 hours in a do-or-die race to success.Said investor Ali Saheli of 7 Gate Ventures over the phone, \"Vancouver allows founders to remove all of the noise that you would get from the Valley and to focus on building products. In the past couple of years the number of early-stage startups has significantly grown thanks to government grants and communities such as Launch Academy and The Next Big Thing.\"Additional notable leaders in the city include investors Boris Wertz and Markus Frind, entrepreneurs Stephen Ufford of Trulioo, Ali Davar of Qudos, Ray Walia of Launch Academy, Carol Newell, founding investor and principal at Renewal Partners and Shahrzad Rafati, CEO at BroadbandTV. Additional startups and events are well-documented by Alex Chuang of Launch Academy on TechCrunch here.One of North America's most European cities, Montreal, Quebec, is also the second-largest primarily French-speaking city in the world, just after Paris. The city has an undeniable allure -- with tons of public art displays, miles of bike lanes and world-class festivals, such as Festival International de Jazz de Montreal, as well as Startupfest.Although Montreal may host a less mature ecosystem when compared to other cities, it boasts world-class universities, including McGill University and Universite de Montreal, and a host of government programs. Additionally, Montreal is home to almost 50 percent of all Startup Weekends in Canada, training close to 1,000 entrepreneurs a year.\"Local government provides the best programs in North America with millions of dollars in grants, loans, innovation tax credits, and even government backed incubators without any cost to the entrepreneurs,\" said Montreal Founder Institute Director Sergio Escobar over the phone. \"As any emerging ecosystem, Montreal has many challenges. Among them, Montreal counts very few seed-stage investors and no pre-seed ones. Many times, seed investors tend to function closer to Series A investors with non-friendly term sheets and low valuations.\"The Founder Institute team in Montreal. Photo by Charles Laberge, Collaboration Speciale, La Presse, 3 September 2015.Startupfest is a three-day festival that takes place in a relaxed \"Tent Village.\" It features keynote speakers, how-to sessions and $200,000 investment opportunities from festival angel investors. Even more, the festival features a panel of infamously tough Grandmothers, to whom entrepreneurs pitch their startups.While the city is considered the cultural capital of Canada, Montreal is also an artificial intelligence stronghold. Just in January, Microsoft announced it would double its investment to AI research and development in the city. Over a five-year period, the tech giant will gift $6 million to the Universite de Montreal, and $1 million to McGill University.A week before this announcement, Microsoft acquired natural language processing and AI startup Maluuba, which was founded by Waterloo graduates Kaheer Suleman and Sam Pasupalak in 2011. In February 2016, it also bought Groove, a Montreal music app that uses machine learning to come up with personalized playlists.In terms of resources for entrepreneurs in Montreal, FounderFuel is an accelerator funded by Real Ventures, a Canadian VC firm. Entrepreneurs Anonymous is a peer-to-peer support group, which takes place at a different Montreal bar each month.Notable leaders in Montreal's ecosystem include John Stokes, general partner at Real Ventures; Sergio Escobar, managing director at the Founder Institute Montreal; LP Maurice, co-founder and CEO at Busbud; Chris Arsenault, partner at iNovia Capital; Mike Cegelski and Francois Gilbert of Anges Quebec; Alan MacIntosh, partner at Real Ventures; Daniel Robichaud, CEO at PasswordBox; Helge Seetzen of TandemLaunch; Beatrice Couture, general manager at InnoCite; and Emma Williams, director at Maison Notman House.The three most popular cities in Canada do not exclusively dominate the startup ecosystem. There are flickers -- and sometimes flares -- of startup activity that certainly have the potential to grow larger in the coming years.Canada's capital, Ottawa, sits on the border with Quebec, and is just about two hours from the city of Montreal. Parliament Hill is the city's main attraction -- and depending on the season, visitors and residents alike skate on the Rideau Canal, which winds for five miles throughout the city.Ottawa is home to Canadian unicorn Shopify, and has been on a kick to make itself the best city in Canada to start a business. Ottawa-based SaaS accelerator L-SPARK, which is directed by Leo Lax, supports talent in the city and also hosts SAAS North, a conference that helps Canadian companies network and promotes Ottawa as the country's capital of SAAS.\"In Ottawa there is a wealth of experienced C-level executives from the telecommunications industry, and as that industry has slowed down it has created an enormous talent pool for startups,\" said Leo Lax over the phone. \"We can shortcut the challenges of building a SAAS company through the experience of the people here.\" Further support in Ottawa includes Invest Ottawa, a group that delivers economic development programs to give entrepreneurs a head start in Canada's capital.The SAAS North team in Ottawa. Photo by Velour Productions.Other notable leaders in Ottawa's ecosystem include Tobi Lutke, CEO of Shopify; Allan Wille, CEO at Klipfolio, Terry Matthews, chairman of Wesley Clover International; Jamie Petten, co-founder of SAAS North; Craig Fitzpatrick, CEO of PageCloud; Adrian Salamunovic and Nazim Ahmed of Canvas Pop; investor Aydin Mirzaee; Victoria Lennox, co-founder and CEO of Startup Canada; and Haidee Thanda, founder of Hacking Health Ottawa.Another city to consider is Edmonton, which is also beginning to carve out a place on the map in the country's startup scene. The city's hubs include incubator TEC Edmonton -- a joint University of Alberta and City of Edmonton initiative ranked the world's 16th best business incubator - Business Link, as well as Startup Edmonton. For the past two years Startup Edmonton has hosted Edmonton Startup Week, which features more than 20 community events for entrepreneurs across the city.Lastly, Labrador and Newfoundland, which are the most eastern point of North America, are beginning to develop grassroots startup communities. This includes StartupNL, a community of entrepreneurs led by Will Gough, Jason Janes and Roger Power that hosts events and programs. In 2014, the government of Newfoundland and Labrador unveiled a $15 million fund to invest in local entrepreneurs and startups, and in 2016, three St. John's, Newfoundland startups announced funding of more than $2 million, including game developer Clockwork Fox Studios, marketing collaboration platform HeyOrca and software provider Sentinel Alert.Canada's ecosystem is still in its early stages. Companies tend to exit too early rather than focusing on growing something sustainable. It often feels like Canadians bow out where Americans -- for whatever reason -- might not. Similarly, sub-zero temperatures scare people to warmer areas, leading to a brain drain and serious demand for startup-orientated marketers. Many current marketing staff are not au fait with startup performance, due to their backgrounds in more traditional industries.Canadian investors have historically looked at minerals and mining companies, which attract much of the capital. People tend to invest in other industries rather than startups because of their prior experience.On the other hand, Canada provides affordable development talent, and thousands of people graduate each year from some of the best universities in the world. Founders are now beginning to enter the startup market again after their first exits, and there is a growing sense of community. In recent years there has been impressive growth in the number of people interested in startups. Government tax incentives reward companies for investing in research and development.Then there is the Trump question. The new U.S. administration's hard stance against immigrants can only play into Canada's favor -- with worldwide talent flocking to the Great White North, the opportunity is Canada's to lose. Over the last five years, Canada has brought in more than 800,000 immigrants to fill holes in the jobs market. With an unfriendly U.S. approach to immigration, international talent could easily look to Canada instead of America as a land of hope and opportunity.With 20 percent of Canada's population already born elsewhere, the country now offers a startup visa to encourage international entrepreneurs to immigrate, with permanent residence status. This is crucial to Canada's future success. By 2019, there will be 182,000 tech jobs up for grabs and nowhere near enough people to fill them. So while Canada's tech scene is growing, there is yet more to come.There are a lot of bright things to come for Canada's startup scene.",

      "title": "Nauta Capital closes out $170M third fund",
      "content": "Early stage VC firm Nauta Capital, which has offices in London, UK, Barcelona, Spain and Boston in the US, has closed out a 2016 fund raising -- capping it off at $170 million.The firm has already closed eight investments with this fund, which had a first closing at $70M, with a further $100M added in parallel -- now closing oversubscribed vs the original target for the fund of around $120M, according to general partner Carles Ferrer. (Its prior funds were $55M raised in 2006, and $115M in 2010.)Nauta has a focus on what it describes as \"capital-efficient Series A software propositions\": aka startups that take a leaner approach to taking on funding vs money-gobbling wannabe unicorns. Its areas of tech interest include b2b software, digital media and \"enabling technologies\" for mobile and the Internet -- with an overall focus on large markets with \"limited previous technology impact\".\"We believe the VC model has been lately too centered around the Unicorn concept, that is too many times return-unrelated,\" Ferrer tells TechCrunch. \"Too many companies are pushed to grow more and more but too early, and for that, raise too much money, again too early. Many of them don't have enough evidence from the market to know if they should be spending so much money.\"If it happens to be too early, that company may end up wasting so much money and energy and having a conflict between equity raised, valuation, and its performance. This too often results in good companies that are actually severely damaged by a poor funding strategies.\"Ferrer argues that the risk for startups raising too much too soon can be especially \"delicate\" in the b2b sector -- describing the firm's philosophy for startups here being \"lean for a good while is beautiful\".\"Once you have enough proof, then it is time to run, but not before. By being lean you maximise chances to obtain premium multiples for yourself and entrepreneurs, at any exit valuation. Too many companies cannot make good money for their investors unless they become a semi or full unicorn and we think this is wrong,\" he adds.Staying away from risky unicorn bets is also pragmatic, given falling startup valuations and the clutch of down rounds in recent years. Albeit, investors in Europe do typically ask to see a clearer path to monetization earlier vs their Silicon Valley counterparts.The 40+ startups in Nauta's portfolio thus far include companies like Brandwatch, Fizzback, GreatCall, Eyeview Digital, Scytl, Basekit, ForceManager, Marfeel, Getapp, Privalia (which exited to Vente-Privee last year) and Social Point (which exited to Take-Two earlier this year).While the investments the firm has made most recently, with the 2016 fund, are: in the UK and Ireland: CloudIQ, BeMyEye and ChannelSight; in Spain: Nextail, Geoblink and Lodgify, and in the Boston area: Content Raven and Connected2Fiber.It says it plans to invest in around 25 companies in total with the fund -- mostly at Series A level, though Ferrer notes there \"may be a reduced number of earlier deals (A minus) when we know very well the entrepreneur\". He says the firm typically invests between $1M and $7M per startup, but describes \"the sweetspot\" as \"usually as a first ticket $1M to $3M\".What makes a team catch the firm's eye? Responding on this he describes its investment thesis as \"very disciplined\", saying: \"We only do what we understand very well and try to stick to it. Capital efficiency is a concept our entrepreneurs believe in also very passionately.\"Overall, he says the approach is to look for industries that have not been disrupted and then pick \"the best companies to do it\", citing a couple of startups it's backed (InCrowd, BeMyEye) that are aiming to disrupt the \"huge and inefficient market research industry\", for example.In terms of geographical spread, Nauta has full investment teams in its three locations, and Ferrer says from London it's able to cover the whole of the UK and Ireland plus \"other continental European countries where companies are born and naturally migrate to London as a hub\"; likewise covering Spain and Portugal -- and looking further north into Europe -- from its Barcelona base.\"We look at other geographies in Europe when companies migrate to our hubs, or have a special interest on our geographies (where we have a team). Eventually, we can learn enough from those geographies to probably in the future invest more actively there too. We think it is so important to have an investment team based where the dealflow is originated. We also have a Boston presence where we cover the east coast and also help European companies migrate,\" he adds.Nauta's current fund has been backed by a group of international investors, based in the UK, Continental Europe, Latin America and China, which it says include leading Institutions (Fund of Funds, Financial Institutions, Insurance Companies, Endowments and government agencies) and large Family Offices.Photo: From left to right, general partners Jordi Vinas, Dominic Endicott, Carles Ferrer and Daniel Sanchez",

      "content": "Zozi, the drama-filled travel industry startup whose former CEO recently sued its board, has been acquired by Peek, a rival in the tours and activities business where Zozi also competes. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the two companies will be joining forces, with the assets and team from Zozi heading over to Peek.The news was reported by Skift, which notes that Peek is basically hiring the Zozi employees and bringing its customers on board, while the Zozi brand and marketplace will be phased out.This is a nice, soft landing for troubled Zozi, which has been struggling with legal battles following the firing of founder and CEO T.J. Sassani, who sued the board for wrongful termination and a host of other outrageous claims. Meanwhile, Zozi staff told us that Sassani had been largely absent from the company for months (even skipping its holiday party), had difficult relations with vendors and was spending money on ventures that other members of the executive team didn't believe in and thought could potentially bankrupt the business.In recent days, Zozi had shifted its focus away from its travel and tours marketplace to Zozi Advance, its B2B platform for bookings and reservations. The changes forced the company to lay off nearly 40 percent of its staff earlier this year.But Zozi Advance held promise, the company believed. It said that the SaaS product allowed it to grow its revenue nearly 3x in 2016, and was on track to double its revenue this year.Peek, on the other hand, grew 10x in the last two years, it says. Last summer the company announced a $10 million round of funding, which included Trulia founder Pete Flint joining its board. It has used that funding to invest in its bookings platform, Peek Pro.Zozi tells us that its Zozi Advance customers will be brought onto Peek Pro's platform in the months ahead. The merchants on the Zozi marketplace will be moved over to Peek.com, but Zozi's brand and consumer offering will later be shuttered.Not all Zozi employees will be joining Peek, from the sound of things. The company says it's currently finalizing the team structure, with plans to bring together \"key members\" of the Peek and Zozi teams to \"leverage the best talent in the space.\"\"Peek shares our vision around putting operators first, said Elon Boms, Zozi board member and investor, about the deal. \"And above all, we care about making sure we provide our operators with the best service and technology to help grow and manage their business. This is a big win for the industry and a big win for our operators.\"",

      "title": "Milanote bags $780k seed to tool up its 'Evernote for creatives'",
      "content": "Creative types looking for software to help seed and spark inspiration don't usually have to look too far. There are a fair few options to play with -- whether it's a mainstream visual sharing platform like Pinterest or a design-focused moodboard-maker like Niice. But just as writers have a variety of workspace preferences, the needs of visual creatives are hardly uniform. So the Australian startup behind Milanote reckons there's room for another approach here.Milanote's platform feels part Evernote, part Pinterest -- indeed, it describes itself as an \"Evernote for creatives\" -- given it's offering users digital spaces (\"boards\") paired with a drag and drop interface that can be used to add and position photos and notes to create visual moodboards or display a grouping of ideas. Its boards are also designed for storing (and/or linking) to related assets -- nesting assets within new boards acting like folders.Boards can also be shared so groups can collaborate and view updates across a project. And Milanote includes a to-do list feature. So, all in all, the platform feels like more of a multipurpose tool than purely a place for designers to play with visuals (though of course you can do that too). But you could also use it to organize and keep on top of research, say, or to create a more visual checklist or chronicle of an event.The platform actually started as an internal tool for the founders' other business (a UX agency) but they decided to spin it out -- launching Milanote in February, and garnering some 35,000 users thus far, according to CEO Ollie Campbell. At this point he says the tool is being used by \"designers, writers, marketers and other creative professionals\" -- working at companies such as Facebook, Apple, Uber, Dropbox, Google, Adobe, Sony and Nike.The team has just closed a $780,000 seed round, led by Simon Martin, the former CFO of MYOB. This will be spent on expanding Milanote's feature set to support what Campbell dubs \"key creative tasks [such as] gathering inspiration from around the web\" (for that it has a \"Pinterest style web clipper\" in the works), as well as on support for video embedding and for more file types.They are also planning to strengthen the collaboration features -- including by adding the ability for users to get feedback from clients, and to comment on updates.\"Milanote is a very 'horizontal\" tool (like Trello/Evernote etc) so we have users from all different industries and roles. Construction workers, poets, artists, authors, game designers, you name it. We have users who are writing novels, planning sermons and organising art exhibitions. But our core target audience is what we call 'visual creative professionals',\" he says when asked who the core user is.\"Creativity is all about synthesising and combining different pieces of information into something new. The problem lots of people face is that their creative work is spread across multiple tools and platforms -- images in Pinterest, notes in Evernote, tasks in Trello, files in Dropbox, messages in Slack. This fragmentation makes it impossible to see the whole picture, which makes it harder to figure things out,\" Campbell adds.\"The key benefit of Milanote is having all of your creative work in one place. This lets you see connections between different pieces of information and trigger new ideas.\"Milanote is a freemium SaaS, so there's a free version with a cap on the number of notes, images or links that can be added to boards, with unlimited storage unlocked at a price -- pricing being dependent on whether it's a sole user or a team.The core push to get visual creatives centralizing more of their project work within Milanote's nested board structure does of course amp up the potential storage requirements which plays into its pricing structure. Though it remains to be seen how much demand there is from visual creatives to do more of their \"communicating spatially\", as the team puts it, vs using a series of digital tools at different points of their creative workflow process -- be it Slack for comms, Dropbox for hosting (and sharing) files, Pinterest for making and sharing moodboards, Google Docs for collaborating and so on.As with any job role that involves playing around with ideas, it's likely to be a case of 'horses for courses'. But Milanote reckons its platform can at least be a contender in the race to gobble up creatives' dollars.",

      "title": "Plug and Play's new accelerator wants to make the fashion industry less wasteful",
      "content": "Textile manufacturing takes a heavy toll on the environment, from the pesticides used to grow cotton to the polluted water created by dye runoff. Fashion's short retail cycle also results in millions of tons of waste every year.Plug and Play hopes that its new accelerator, called Plug and Play-Fashion for Good, will solve some of these issues by connecting textile startups with large retailers. The program, a partnership between Plug and Play, Fashion for Good, a global initiative founded by C&A Foundation, and luxury conglomerate Kering, whose brands include Gucci and Alexander McQueen, launched last week in Amsterdam.Its first batch includes companies that create organic dyes from microorganisms (Pili-Bio) and cleaners from carbon dioxide to reduce water waste (Tersus). The full list of startups is: Agraloop, Amadou, Dragon, Dropel, ICA Bremen, MySource, MycoTex, Pili-bio, RePack, Sundar, Tersus and TipaLike Plug and Play's other programs, the textile accelerator's goal is to build relationships between startups and corporations, says Plug and Play founder and CEO Saeed Amidi. In this case, these include Walmart and Target, in addition to C&A Foundation and Kering.\"Technology can find a better way to dye clothes or a better way to grow cotton or reuse end-of-life clothing,\" says Amidi. \"We think the same process of accelerating software startups can be applied to fashion.\"Michael Olmstead, Plug and Play's vice president of corporate partnerships, adds that the accelerator's goals is to take innovation in the apparel industry beyond e-commerce companies.\"Fashion is one of the most polluting industries and we're looking to really accelerate the transition to a very circular industry,\" he says.Some of the startups in Plug and Play--Fashion for Good's first batch are developing new types of textiles made from plants. For example, Mycotex and Amadou both create leather substitutes from mushroom fibers, which are not only biodegradable, but may also help reduce methane emissions from livestock and pollutants from the tanning process.Other companies, like ICA Bremen, focus on accountability in the manufacturing process. ICA Bremen uses nano-technology to create tiny tracers that allows manufacturers to keep track of how much organic cotton fiber a piece of fabric contains, an important criteria for organic certification.One incentive for retailers is that young consumers are willing to spend extra on brands that cultivate a reputation for environmental responsibility.\"If you look at a generation that is really conscious of sustainability, it's millennials,\" Olmstead notes, \"And they are obviously the ones who are spending money.\"",

      "title": "A new on-demand battle is speeding toward the US, and VCs are seeing dollar signs",
      "content": "The battle isn't over car sharing. It's not over bus sharing, either, though that, too, is a growing focus for investors and automotive companies that are desperate to understand how cities and transportation are changing. This clash is over the latest wrinkle in urban bike-sharing -- dockless bike sharing. And it has founders and VCs around the globe seeing dollar signs, while regulators are wrestling -- again -- with how to ensure they're not victims of a trend that seemed to emerge nearly overnight.\"Dockless bike sharing is something that people worry about until they realize it's a benefit\" to society, says Atomico co-founder Mattias Ljungman, who calls the ability to leave one's bicycle where a trip ends \"the real revolution here.\" Docking stations are \"very complicated,\" he says. \"Not only do riders need to know where to park their bikes, but sometimes the stations are full. It's a pain.\"Atomico has already placed a big bet on Ofo, a Beijing-based dockless bike-share company that has so far raised roughly $580 million from VCs at a post-money valuation of north of $1 billion. China-based investors are looking to pour even more into the three-year-old company given its current momentum, suggests Ljungman, citing the more than one million connected bikes it has already placed on city streets in China, and customers who are taking an astonishing 10 million rides per day, compared with the roughly 10 million rides per year that London's public bike-sharing service powers.The story is much the same for 16-month-old, Shanghai-based Mobike, which also claims to have more than a million bikes in its fleet and has raised $410 million from investors at a valuation that the WSJ reports is north of $1 billion.Another Beijing-based bike-share company, Bluegogo, is drafting behind both. Founded a mere six months ago, it has already raised at least $65 million from investors.Still, China is not the U.S; it remains to be seen if a variation of the model will work here. \"Just as China will tell you that things that work in the rest of the world won't work in China because of its 5,000-year-long cultural history, things in China don't necessarily work [in the U.S.] either,\" says Sean O'Sullivan, the founder and managing director of the venture firm SOSV.Friend or foeO'Sullivan has been watching dockless bike sharing as closely as anyone. Like a growing number of VCs, he has a horse in this race: New York-based Social Bicycles, or SoBi, which says it was first in producing a dockless bike that features a trackable GPS system and an integrated lock that allows it to be parked at any bike rack in a city.SoBi founder Ryan Rzepecki launched the company in 2010 after serving 17 months as a project manager at the New York Department of Transportation. There, he says, he was witness to the city's earliest thinking about bike sharing, before it partnered with Alta, then parent company of Citi Bike. New York is now home to the largest bike-share program in the U.S., but it required years of advance planning that Rzepecki says gave him \"great appreciation for how cities work and the things that concern them.\"Among them were \"ensuring the bikes would be inspected and maintained, that their docking stations would be kept clean, that bikes would be evenly distributed throughout the city, and that there was data sharing,\" says Rzepecki's then-boss, former New York DOT Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan, who now advises mayors on urban planning. \"It was pretty basic stuff\" that had New Yorkers' best-interest in mind, she adds. \"Rogue bike systems,\" she complains, don't necessarily have the same priorities.\"These new companies seem to be using [the bikes] more like marketing vehicles and using the streets for their private gain,\" Sadik-Khan says of Ofo and Mobike, which are giving city dwellers more freedom to zip around congested cities like Shanghai, but attracting bad press in the process around bike-strewn pedestrian walkways and bikes piled sky high. \"You can create dangerous situations by inviting this tsunami of bikes that could wind up anywhere and everywhere.\"Rzepecki certainly believes they've been less thoughtful in their approach than SoBi, which has more than a thousand of its own bikes in Santa Monica, Ca., and Portland, Ore., among other places in the U.S., Canada and Europe.Most importantly, he says, SoBi has \"entered into a partnership with every city where we're operating,\" he says. \"Having been on the other side, we understood the importance of being good partners.\"SoBi also uses incentives to manage its fleet of bikes so that \"instead of a scavenger hunt to find a bike each day, a user knows that there's a bunch of bikes three blocks away.\" How it works: Users pay per minute, with pro-rated prices ranging from $3 per hour to $8 per hour depending on the city. Most rides last 15 minutes on average, with most trips costing $2 apiece. But riders face extra fees if they lock up a bike outside an area that's been geofenced by SoBi. Conversely, if a user parks a bike in a particular area at SoBi's request, that rider is given a credit.One might think the difference too nominal to pack a punch, but it's \"really effective\" in ensuring equal distribution of the bikes, says Rzepecki. Meanwhile, Ofo and Mobike have no such incentives program in place, counting instead on the market to self-regulate. They also barreled into the many Chinese cities without consulting first with local regulators, a move that investors -- which include China-based heavyweights Xiaomi and Tencent Holdings -- seemed to sanction.That's begun to change more recently. \"Ofo is working with government,\" insists Ljungman. \"It's always looking for solutions.\" Rzepecki hints that they have no choice. \"Shenzhen and Shanghai are starting to put in service standards to prevent chaos in the streets.\"Good or evilCertainly, cities have plenty of reason to want bike-share programs to work, dockless or otherwise. Bikes don't produce carbon emissions, they take up less space than cars and riding a bicycle is a heart-healthy activity.San Francisco, which was caught off guard by plans by Ofo and Bluegogo to enter the U.S., recently proposed legislation around how to obtain and maintain a stationless bike-share permit. (Bluegogo, which initially aimed to park its bicycles in public bike racks, says now it will use bike stations in private parking spaces.)NACTO, an association of 51 major North American cities, issued a statement earlier this week saying it also welcomes bike-share systems of all stripes, as long as they're \"part of a city's overall transportation network and vision.\" (Companies that have \"shown that they are not serious about providing bikes as a real mobility option for people .  . . [but] more interested in media attention and a quick buyout . . . put the public at risk,\" it added.)Dockless bikes make a lot of sense as a last-mile option for commuters, too. Even now, Rzepecki sees a day when SoBi's bikes are electric and work with fleets of autonomous cars and shuttles to get people to their office doors. Ofo has the same ambitions, says Ljungman, not least because China's ride-hailing giant Didi is among its investors. In fact, Didi's customers can already reserve an Ofo bike through Didi's app.As with Uber -- which envisioned itself as a logistics company from the start -- the potential also exists for the bikes to carry more than people. Ljungman says that making deliveries, for example, is \"not something [Ofo] has on its radar, but given they're building a really interesting network and distribution capability . . . the amount of products and services you can attach to that is pretty large.\"Still, it's easy to conclude that investors -- and founders -- are getting ahead of themselves in a race to create the next so-called decacorn.Though Ofo has global ambitions -- it reportedly wants to introduce 50,000 bikes in roughly 10 U.S. cities by July -- Ljungman acknowledges that the U.S. market will be a tough nut to crack. \"You need the right kind of cities. In many places in the world, cities weren't built around cars. They were built around people walking or cycling or even riding horses,\" he notes. \"There's a cultural aspect, too. In Amsterdam, you see lots of bicycles all over the place. They rule the city.\" That's not so in many American cities where bikers represent fewer than 1 percent of all commuters.The economics of the business appear challenged, too. While bike-share companies insist that they're making the bikes as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible in partnership with China-based manufacturers, it hasn't proven a lucrative business to date. For example, Motivate -- which bought Citi Bike from Alta in 2014 -- now oversees more than 10,000 bikes across bike-sharing programs in 10 U.S. cities and recorded 14 million rides last year, and it still isn't profitable, says a source close to the company. Presumably, making electric bikes will be even more costly.And there are shenanigans. According to O'Sullivan, the founders of one dockless bike-share startup met earlier with Rzepecki under the guise of wanting to fund SoBi, which has reached profitability off $7 million in funding to date and is now looking to raise substantially more. They then used their findings to raise money for a new startup of their own.Asked about the claim, Rzepecki declines to confirm it, saying instead, \"A lot of people are entering the market and maybe being a bit more opportunistic in trying to compete. For me, it's generally a good sign that we have an environment now that's being capitalized, even if not everyone has the same intentions that we have.\"It's almost like the second coming of Uber. At least, people seem to hope that's the case.\"I do think Uber's bad-boy behavior has emboldened some to also break laws and charge ahead of social consequences,\" says O'Sullivan. \"They got away with it, and they got rewarded for it financially, despite hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements to state regulators and elsewhere.\"Until Uber came along, I never thought it could possibly have worked. Now others may see it as a model worth copying.\"Additional reporting by (and valuable insights from) Lora Kolodny.",

      "content": "Disrupt NY is but a month away, and we're more excited than ever about our brand new Founder Spotlight.The Founder Spotlight gives young but proven startups the chance to tell their origin story, from that original \"Aha!\" moment to the pivot, if there was one, to today. It will also give budding entrepreneurs the opportunity to hear actual founders talk about their journey from their old job to being top dog at a rapidly growing startup.We've already revealed the first three companies participating in the Founder Spotlight, and today we have three more for you: Capsule, Nestio, and PS Dept.Capsule is a re-invention of the pharmacy. The company has built out its own team of pharmacists and an actual brick-and-mortar pharmacy in NYC so that users can have their prescriptions filled and delivered whenever they want. While most pharmacies invest profits back into the retail side of the store, selling candy and magazines, Capsule instead invests its returns back into its chat services, letting users ask questions and get medical information via SMS, web chat, and email. Capsule has raised money from Thrive, but has yet to disclose the amount.Nestio first launched in 2011 as a consumer-facing service to help renters find apartments, aggregating Trulia and Streeteasy listings in a single app. Since, however, Nestio has pivoted to solve for the core problem: out-of-date listings. Brokers, management companies and landlords have been using antiquated technology for years to market and update their listings. With Nestio, which operates on a standard SaaS model, those same parties are able to communicate amongst each other in real time, providing a much better experience for their own clients, the renters.PS Dept combines big data and the wits of a real person to make sure its users have the easiest, most accurate access to information around designer clothing. Most high-fashion shoppers know what they want and they want it now, but access to information around availability can be difficult to come by. PS Dept uses an easy messaging platform to help users find the bag, shoes, or blouse that they've been searching for, while providing brands and retailers with a dedicated customer service arm. PS Dept has raised $6.4 million to date.Alongside the super stars of the Founder Spotlight, Disrupt NY's speaker list is downright awesome. We encourage you to check out speakers here, and grab yourself a ticket to Disrupt right here.Sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.

      "title": "Europe's Rockstart accelerator launches an AI track",
      "content": "Netherlands-based accelerator program Rockstart, which focuses on helping startups through their first 1,000 days, has launched a new vertical program for artificial intelligence startups -- touting it as Europe's first AI-focused accelerator.The AI program will be accepting applications from next month, and Rockstart says it will pick ten startups for the six-month program, which will commence in September. Teams will be based in s'Hertogenbosch.Rockstart has been accelerating startups since 2012, and is backed by partners including Google, Amazon and IBM. It says the new AI track will be supported by mentors and partners including the locally-based Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS).There's no specific industry focus for the program -- with the idea being to attract AI startups from a range of industries. \"We consciously decided not to narrow it down in order to have startups from different industries working under one roof -- that's, in my opinion, where innovation often comes from,\" says a spokesman.\"We indeed have seen a number of startups with AI at their core in our other programs over the past couple of years. With this new program, we want to be able to add more value for startups like those by delivering relevant tech/business expertise, knowledge, and partnerships,\" he adds.The selection criteria for the AI track will be the same as for Rockstart's other programs.\"We're looking first of all at the team, and then at the product/idea and whether it's actually demanded by the respective industry. If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail, so one of our goals is to avoid employing a technology for the technology's sake. In the selection process we're going to focus, among other things, on whether AI is really the best solution for the problem the startup is trying to solve,\" the spokesman tells TechCrunch.Startups accepted for the program will receive EUR20,000 cash and EUR80,000 of \"in-kind funding\", office space in Den Bosch for the duration, and support from mentors from relevant industries, as well as more than 50 perks and deals (billed as worth some EUR600,000) from program partners.Named mentors for the AI track include Dr Eric Postma, professor at JADS; Jasper Wognum, the founder of BrainCreators; Dr Mykola Pechenizkiy, professor at Eindhoven University of Technology; and Christoph Auer-Welsbach, partner at IBM Ventures and initiator at City.AI.Rockstart says it expects to take a 6 percent stake in startups entering the program -- after they've raised their next round of funding.Last month US-based startup hothouse factory Y Combinator also launched a dedicated AI track. So while all startups will likely be AI startups in the future, there are dedicated accelerator programs springing up to plug the gap in the meanwhile.",

      "title": "Index leads $5M Series A in Beamery's 'CRM for recruitment'",
      "content": "London-based Beamery has closed a $5 million Series A for its candidate relationship software. The round is led by Index Ventures, with participation from existing investors Edenred Capital Partners, GP Ventures and LocalGlobe.It's a fast follow from the startup's $2 million seed, raised in June last year. Beamery says the new funding will be used to double its headcount and open a new sales and marketing-focused office in the Bay Area, while keeping its core product dev and engineering team in London.In a blog about the funding, Index's Jan Hammer argues Beamery's approach to recruitment gives companies a strategic advantage in hiring by enabling them to identify and develop relationships with potential future recruits before they even have a specific vacancy to offer.\"When you shift to this approach and become highly strategic in developing relationships with top candidates, you outsmart and outpace competitors,\" says Hammer, citing Beamery's claim that its users have seen the cost of hiring fall by 39 percent and time-to-hire drop by 31 percent since using its software.The startup, which was founded back in 2014, has around 50 customers using its software at this point, including the likes of Facebook, Dropbox, VMware and Criteo. Active users number around 1,000, according to CEO Abakar Saidov.\"In short think of it like Salesforce + Marketo for recruitment. We are an API-first CRM platform that lets companies track the entire candidate lifecycle from Lead > Application > Hire. This changes how companies recruit on a strategic level. We use AI and automation to scale this process,\" is Saidov's elevator pitch for the platform. Beamery's software essentially offers a richer environment for tracking and connecting with potential job candidates versus a manual organizational tool such as a spreadsheet, while also plugging in the ability for users to search candidate profiles using granular filters; make approaches to potential hires via email marketing and/or event invites; and view analytics of candidate responsiveness so they can judge which potential hires might be most receptive to an approach. The underlying premise is to turn recruitment into more of an active and ongoing brand marketing/outreach exercise, versus companies only searching for candidates at the point of direct need, and limiting their talent pool to only those who actively apply.  \"Nothing is built to be a system of record for passive candidates for roles that don't exist yet,\" argues Saidov. \"Therefore you are missing the bulk of the market. The more progressive companies that are recognizing that you need to go after and 'Acquire' the talent you want have to use spreadsheets to store this data.\"Rather than having 'job-centric' ATS systems, this is 'people-centric' CRM system. That means businesses can focus on leads rather than applicants. This means everyone is a potential candidate, a relationship that needs to be tracked and nurtured before, during and after the applications process.\"Saidov says the platform is not geared toward specific sectors or job roles but is rather aimed at \"every business that is trying to be strategic\" about recruitment -- though the first wave of customers has, unsurprisingly, come from the early adopter tech sector, along with some \"more traditional\" brands, such as House of Fraser, Shop Direct and Continental Tires.\"We help tech firms map their future hiring needs and retail firms re-engage past talent that didn't get hired,\" he adds. \"Finally you are seeing the full cycle of talent management, rather than just the applicant process. This allows you to be strategic about where talent is going to come from.\"On the competitors front Saidov name-checks Avature, \"a more dated talent CRM,\" and Smashfly, which he says is focused on job board distribution, as the main rivals, along with some (unnamed) content management systems.",

      "title": "Gig economy stalwart TaskRabbit is contemplating a sale",
      "content": "One of the earliest and most prominent startups of the so-called \"sharing economy\" or \"gig economy\" is evaluating the possibility of selling itself. As reported by Recode, freelance work marketplace TaskRabbit acknowledged that it is contemplating a sale after receiving inbound interest from a possible strategic buyer.TaskRabbit launched in early 2008 as a way to match up with various types of odd jobs in their local area part-time workers who had spare time. In its earliest days, the business operated in a very loose marketplace model -- users could list jobs they needed accomplished and the price they were willing to pay for those services, and so-called \"TaskRabbits\" could choose to accept those jobs or not.It was a pretty novel concept at the time, but it wasn't long before a number of other startups cropped up offering similar capabilities. Over time, those gig economy companies started to position themselves around specific types of work, with many attempting to be the place to go for cleaning services or home improvement.A few more years passed, and, after some initial excitement around the gig economy, follow-on venture capital dried up and many of TaskRabbit's competitors either shut down or were acquired for pennies on the dollar.And so here we are. After raising $38 million dollars from investors like Shasta Ventures, Founders Fund, First Round, Floodgate, CollabFund and others, there's little appetite for other investors to keep putting money in companies like TaskRabbit.So what now? All indications are that handyman services, light home renovation and furniture assembly are going to end up being a billion-dollar business. So it makes sense that TaskRabbit would explore the possibility of a sale if there's a buyer -- or multiple buyers -- interested.The only question is who those buyers might be, and how much they might be willing to pay for the business.",

      "title": "A look inside the Skopje startup scene",
      "content": "On Wednesday I had the unique pleasure of hanging out with a bunch of Macedonian startup founders and was very impressed. The Balkans have long been a promising spot for startups - the cost of living is low and the talent level is high - and this visit was unique in that everyone was fully prepared to pitch on a global scale.The winners of the pitch-off were Letz, a cool chatbot that won a Best Technology Product award on Product Hunt and TakeAnAd which makes it easy to capture and post Facebook ads. One of the judges came from Grouper, a shopping app that single-handedly brought online shopping penetration from 1% to nearly 100% in less than a decade.In short, these were some solid ideas and they were working hard to push things forward.The most interesting thing I've noticed over the past few years is the spread of the \"theatre of entrepreneurship\" - the ability for young people to pound out excellent two minute pitches in harsh environments. This means a few things. First it shows that these techniques are truly global - the same can be said of folks in Skopje as it can be of folks in Skokie. Further, it means that cool things are everywhere.The biggest problem for these places is seed capital. I've spoken to a number of investors from various cities who offer a bunch of hand-waving and wiggling as they explain that they only do see rounds in companies in their back yards or with plenty of traction. I would argue that companies in markets outside of New York, LA, SF, Berlin, and London - companies situated in places where offices are $850 a month and salaries are comparably low - could produce some real winners more consistently if they had access to small injections of capital early on. VCs, on the other hand, want to see growth and revenue and they want to be able to bike to the startup offices which means a kid from Skopje has to be shelling out a few thousand a month to satisfy the whims of a professional No-man.There are small funds trying their damnedest to help and they envision a time when their smaller markets will become true farm teams for global reach.Will this happen? No. The stewardship of capital is too important to a dude in Palo Alto to consider dumping it in Zagreb. The risks of dropping cash in Warsaw - which we could argue are minimal - are too great for a post-Brexit Londoner. The only answer it sees is for these small markets to send their best and brightest to accelerators in the Valley and hope for the best although I would argue that a programmer situated nicely in Skopje with a cheap apartment and a great quality of life is going to be a longer-lasting employee than one who lands in SFO from Tirana, lives in a squat with five other people to work on a product, and then gives up and works for Google.Of course I'm being needlessly cynical. After all, as evidenced by the teams that pitched, these companies are easily able to fend for themselves, with or without investment. But a shot in the arm and a pat on the back could definitely help.The challenges facing folks in Skopje and Belgrade and Warsaw and Vienna are not small. In a culture that rewarded career longevity, pensions, and a retirement at the dacha the idea that you would eschew a cubicle at Citibank is akin to blasphemy. It takes guts to get up and pitch in English and it takes guts to fight for every ounce of cash and it takes guts to succeed even in your little corner of the world. This effort should be rewarded with appreciation, support, and education. I'm not yet sure it is, obviously, but we're getting there.",

      "content": "London-based Triptease, a startup that offers a SaaS to help hotels increase direct sales and therefore keep more revenue, has closed a $9 million Series B. The new round was led by BGF Ventures, with participation from existing investors Notion Capital and Episode 1 Ventures.Triptease was founded in 2012 on the premise that hotels can do a much better job at direct selling rather than letting a plethora of online travel agencies (OTAs) and hotel booking aggregators, such as Booking.com and Expedia, cream off the top of their profits by means of affiliate revenue. Triptease's best-known product is Price Check, a widget that sits on hotel websites and displays prices from across the web in real time.The idea is to reduce the uncertainty surrounding a hotel's direct price, and ensure you don't wander off to search elsewhere but instead book direct and with confidence.That in itself is a neat trick, but the startup has since expanded to offer a number of other features built around the notion that hotels can make much better use of their data, both individually and anonymously in aggregate, to increase their ability to compete with the OTAs.\"By signing up to the Triptease platform, hotels with only a few thousand web visitors a month can learn from the millions of user sessions the company are tracking across the industry,\" says the company.This includes real-time price alerts if an OTA/aggregator cuts its own prices in order to manage parity, as well as personalizing the experience of direct online visitors by giving the right message at the right time so as to increase conversion. Or, as the Triptease website puts it, \"convert lookers into bookers.\"Meanwhile, Triptease says it will use the new capital for further product development, and to fuel growth and international expansion, specifically in Asia. This will see the company open a new office in Singapore, in addition to doubling headcount in its existing London and New York offices.Adds Rory Stirling, partner at BGF Ventures, in a statement: \"We are very excited to be joining Triptease as a new investor at a time when the company is showing great growth in the markets where it has established a presence. Now it's time to expand the software to Asian hotels, to make this a truly global product. With consolidation amongst online travel agencies, hotels are increasingly looking for options to help them mobilise people to their own websites and Triptease is the best in its sector.\"",

      "content": "If you don't succeed, try and try again. Unless you are a surgeon. But this is all about to change, using nothing but pixels and data.\u00a0SEE ALSO: This stem cell gun helps burn victims regrow their skin in just a few daysTouch Surgery's cofounders, Dr. Jean Nehme and Dr. Andre Chow, are young surgeons who taught themselves how to code. Now, they're on a mission to transform medicine \u2013 by digitalizing it.\u00a0Practicing an acute trauma craniotomyImage:  GIF via touch surgeryTouch Surgery, a UK-based medical training startup, has developed an immersive surgical simulator that replicates complex procedures, breaking them down in steps. It's available in app form, allowing users to transform their fingertips into scalpels on the go. That way, surgery newbies can attempt complex procedures all they want, without risking actual lives. The next step is to deliver the immersive and freakishly realistic 3D animations in VR form.Practice makes perfect.Traditionally, young surgeons don't really get any trial and error sessions before they step into the operating room. It's kind of like learning to fly a plane without using the flight simulator.This is changing, thanks to apps like Touch Surgery. After visiting their enormous two-floor space, I attempted a simple hand surgery, step by step, in thin air, while wearing a HoloLens headset.\u00a0No patients were harmed in the writing of this article.\u00a0The simulation itself is pretty straight forward and your actions as a digital surgeon are limited. You can only strictly follow the steps outlined. So no impromptu incisions. You also can't see what happens if you do something wrong like puncturing a vein. (So it's nothing like the board game Operation.)This makes the simulator a bit constrained and rigid in its virtual representations, but maybe that's the point. Touch Surgery is supposed to prepare surgeons for the specific steps they need to take on the operating table. It's about helping them improve their decision-making and making it as close to the real thing as possible. \u00a0Image:  GIF via MashableThe Touch Surgery office harnesses far more than strictly medical expertise. There are people coming from the visual effects industry (more specifically, the world of Star Wars), mobile and gaming developers, and graphic designers.\"We\u2019re able to replicate 3D anatomy and 3D surgical process to a really high degree of fidelity. And we use that to put surgeons into the right mindset to make sure that they\u2019re making decisions as realistically as possible,\" Dr. Chow said.\u00a0A post shared by Touch Surgery (@touchsurgery) on Sep 1, 2016 at 11:08am PDTThey are now collaborating with universities and hospitals to fine-tune and expand the procedures that can be simulated. There are already over a hundred. Touch Surgery has also been picked up by John Hopkins University as part of the procedure evaluating novice surgeons.\u00a0The app itself has grown in popularity, with over a million users around the world. Interestingly, a significant number are actually patients. Dr. Chow said Touch Surgery has the added benefit of allowing patients to actually see what the procedure that they are undergoing would look like. That demystifies surgeries from the patient's point of view, which tends to be entirely limited to just before being put to sleep and right after waking up.\u00a0The ultimate goal is going global, with the incredible spread of smartphone use across the world.Precision is key.Image:  GIF VIA TOUCH SURGERY\"There are around 7 billion people on the planet, but 5 billion people don\u2019t have access to safe surgical services,\" said Dr. Chow. \"That\u2019s why we created Touch Surgery \u2013 to be part of that story that helps scale surgery to really meet global demand.\"\u00a0Essentially, what the simulator is intended to do is transform access to surgical training and achieve a sense of equality in surgical training around the world.\u00a0In other words, one day you won't need to find the best surgeon to perform a complex brain surgery or hand transplant, because surgical services, uniformly, will be able to provide care at a very high and risk-free standard.\u00a0\"Ultimately,\" Dr. Chow said, \"we want to be at a stage within the next five to ten years, where we can be saying that what Touch Surgery does saves lives.\"",

Susan is the President of BBG Ventures, an early stage fund focused on consumer internet and mobile startups with at least one female founder.What originally sparked your interest in female consumers?When I started working in media back in the mid 70\u2019s, no one talked about data \u2013 everything we did was by instinct: what do we think people want to read about? Will this cover line be a magnet for readers? But it didn\u2019t take me long to realize that women bought many more magazines than men did, and that you could grow your circulation by talking to them.When I went to ABC the conventional wisdom was that women would watch shows made for men, but men wouldn\u2019t watch shows for women - so everyone was chasing the next Law and Order, the next CSI.

She said, \u201call my shows are gone,\u201d meaning shows like Ally McBeal, Melrose Place, SITC, that women gathered to watch together and talked about the next day. It was a wakeup call for me \u2013 and we decided to buck the conventional wisdom and go after the next \u201cgirl\u201d show. Out of that development season came Desperate Housewives, Grey\u2019s Anatomy and The Bachelor.I went from ABC to Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia to Gilt.com, companies that delivered something unique to women and in the process built strong brands and loyal followings. Women make the final decision on 85% of all consumer purchases - and they\u2019re increasingly the early adopter and power user of new tech platforms and services. Women should spark everyone\u2019s interest!Where did the inspiration for BBG Ventures begin?It goes back to my time at Gilt. I joined the company in 2008, the year after the iPhone launched. We didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but that was a transformational moment for entrepreneurs because it put a computer in everyone\u2019s pocket. NYC was starting to emerge as a tech center, and the city attracted a different kind of female founder \u2013 women who were reimagining every aspect of home and work life to be more efficient, more productive, or just more fun.\u00a0That first wave included companies like LearnVest, BirchBox, Paperless Post and, of course, Rent the Runway. Raising money was a challenge because 95% of venture investors are men. So before they could get to the meat of their pitch, they had to explain how women think about their closets, or why we\u2019re always on the hunt for the next great beauty product. I thought: let\u2019s back the best of these female founders, who inherently understand the end user \u2013 what she needs, what she wants, what will delight her.At BBG Ventures you believe the greatest untapped opportunity for venture capital lies in backing women. Why women?A few reasons: first, women are the dominant consumers \u2013 and not just in the obvious areas like apparel and food, but insurance, computers, cars, home purchases, medical care. We\u2019re also the power users of most new consumer tech platforms and services. So it makes good sense to back entrepreneurs who know that end user, especially since the majority of venture investors aren\u2019t hunting there. Pattern recognition leads VCs to get more excited by someone who looks like Mark Zuckerberg. That\u2019s an advantage for those of us who are focused on women.From your experience, what does having at least one female founder do for a company?At consumer-facing companies, it ensures that there is someone in a decision-making position who really gets how and why women will use the product. We invested in a company called Hop, Skip, Drive \u2013 a ride service for kids founded by 3 working moms in LA. When we made the investment, there was a better-funded competitor in SF. That founder skimped on background checks and spent his money instead on marketing. HSD knew the #1 issue for customers (moms) would be safety; so from day one they fingerprinted every driver. Two years later, the SF company has folded, and HSD is thriving.It's still early days but there\u2019s also evidence that teams with a female founder have better outcomes. First Round, one of the oldest early-stage VCs in NYC, did a look-back at their first 10 years of investing and discovered that companies with a female founder performed 63% better than all-male teams. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising: research has consistently shown that diverse teams drive better results because they\u2019re more likely to challenge assumptions. That forces you to focus more on facts and to process information more carefully \u2013 and gets you to better solutions.When you hear a pitch, which is most likely to convince you to invest: the person, the product, or the revenue potential?The ultimate gating factor is always going to be the person: do we believe that this founder can take the product all the way? No business, no matter how successful it may look from outside, has gotten there without serious bumps in the road. The founder is going to face days when nothing is working. She needs tenacity and grace; conviction and a willingness to try something new. It\u2019s a tall order.Why do you think it\u2019s taken so long for people to focus their investment strategies on female-led business ventures?I think it goes back to the way the tech industry has evolved. I read an interview with Marc Andreeson a few years ago where he talked about the origins of the Silicon Valley startup scene, when the customer for your product was a big tech company. Founders came out of engineering programs or CS programs. It wasn\u2019t until the focus shifted from enterprise to consumer that women began starting companies in large numbers. Add to that the fact that less than 5% of venture partners are female and you start to see why it\u2019s been an uphill battle.What do you see for the future of women in business?I see blue sky ahead. We just need a few big wins. Once we have a few examples of women-led companies successfully going public, or being acquired for billions of dollars, it will put to rest the rest the silly arguments about whether women can compete in this marketplace. And you\u2019ll see a lot more venture capital chasing female founders. We\u2019re close to that moment.What\u2019s your advice to women who are asking themselves whether their product is worthy of pursuing venture funding?Ask yourself whether your product solves a real problem faced by millions of people (the market size); whether people or companies will pay to use it (your business model); and whether you are the first-mover or have proprietary technology (competitive advantage). If the answer to those things is yes, start working on a deck!",

Pandora pulled this off, but nowhere close to Spotify\u2019s $8 billion private valuation.The clock is ticking: Spotify has a debt obligation that gets more onerous the longer an IPO is put off.

And as a pure-play, Spotify must make money for the ecosystem along with themselves to stay around, as opposed to YouTube which as part of Google makes plenty of money elsewhere. Pandora is preferred to YouTube, but Spotify is even preferred to Pandora, because Pandora has such an heavy emphasis on ads versus paying customers. If there is one company the labels must keep in business and independent, it\u2019s Spotify.The second is that Ek has long taken an approach to working with the labels not trying to \u201cdisrupt\u201d them.

      "title": "How I Overcame My Fear of Hiring Outsourced Developers",
      "content": "The term \u201coutsourcing\u201d has become a bit of a dirty word in the software development industry. However, outsourcing software development, -- or \u201cdigital outsourcing,\u201d as it's called -- is a great way to maximize efficiency. Outsourcing certain tasks, a once-taboo subject, is quite common: Accenture, IBM, Microsoft, Intel, Amazon, P&G, Bank of America\u00a0and Hewlett-Packard have all jumped on board.Related:\u00a05 Reasons Why It's a Bad Idea for Startups to Outsource Software DevelopmentThe list of fears surrounding digital outsourcing can be lengthy, but those fears can be alleviated. Below are four of the most common concerns regarding outsourcing software development and how to mitigate them to make outsourcing work for your business.Many business leaders have expressed concern about the hidden costs associated with outsourcing. Hidden costs include money wasted on unproductive operations abroad, money lost due to cultural differences, transition-related costs like temporary decreases in productivity\u00a0and the costs of managing the outsourced team.Luckily, good communication will do a lot to mitigate these costs. In addition to informal daily communication with your \"abroad\" team, schedule teleconferences or meetings regularly to discuss larger issues that might be hindering productivity or cohesion. The more you can get to know your abroad team, the better: You\u2019ll be able to verify that this particular team is the right fit for your company.You can also avoid hidden or extra costs by planning ahead. Establish clear productivity and team-building goals, and have the outsourced team commit to accomplishing those goals within a set period of time. Make milestones frequent and achievable by adjusting them as necessary.The fear of choosing the wrong vendor to handle your development needs is valid and common. However, you can take certain precautions to make sure you\u2019re happy with whom you choose.Related:\u00a0Should You Outsource Mobile SaaS Development?Pick your outsourced vendor wisely. Instead of just choosing the cheapest service, look into experience, success metrics, testimonials\u00a0and potential language barriers. Also, ensure that the vendor will be willing to work on your schedule. Depending on your project, close collaboration might be necessary; as such, you\u2019ll want your abroad team to operate on your local team\u2019s hours.Most importantly, don\u2019t be afraid to switch! One great thing about outsourcing development is that outsourcing opens the door to many viable options. If you\u2019re unsatisfied with the work product of your outsourced team, you can easily find another team for a comparable, or even lower, price.Another common fear is that leaders won\u2019t be able to ensure efficiency due to skill gaps between outsourced developers and local developers. Creating strong ties between the two groups, however, is an easy fix.Depending on the structure of your company, consider keeping a few skilled developers in-house. You can then implement systems to check the outsourced work as it is created, to avoid receiving a subpar work product.For example, re-compile and build your software every time a developer submits work for a \u00a0product. Doing this will help detect problems immediately so they can be remedied without delay. You can also require that outsourced team members develop and run individual tests for their products during development.Creating tests prior to the implementation of a feature can\u00a0help clarify what the software should ultimately do. These tests can then be run again and again throughout development. Testing needs to be automated and thorough, and the end-user experience should always be kept in mind.Collaboration is another valuable method to mitigate the skill gap. If possible, in addition to frequently communicating with your outsourced team members, strive to collaborate with them to better resolve potential problems that occur during development. Using Scrum is a great way to facilitate this collaboration.Finally, require that your outsourced team members create technical documentation so you can better understand their work. If you switch vendors in the future, you\u2019ll need the technical and architectural specifications for the tasks your current outsourced developers are working on to avoid future delays.Security is a concern for many developers who work with trade secrets and other types of private data, so it\u2019s imperative to take this into account when selecting a vendor. International certifications for data privacy exist, and most reputable vendors should meet the certification requirements.When choosing an outsourced vendor, look for past incidents regarding client security. How did the vendor handle it? How would you handle it? By considering possible security issues beforehand, you can avoid potential disaster later.Related:\u00a0Outsource Your App Development Effectively With These 5 TipsAJ Agrawal is the CEO and co-founder of Alumnify. an alumni-engagement platform.",

      "content": "FCC Chairman Ajit Pai on Wednesday proposed a reversal of existing net neutrality rules that were instituted in 2015. The rules reclassified broadband internet service providers as public utilities in an effort to create a more open internet, not weighted to those entities that could pay more to receive faster service.Led by Engine, Techstars and Y Combinator, more than 800 members of the tech community, including Chartbeat, Etsy, Medium and Matter Ventures, signed their names to an open letter protesting the move.Read the full letter below.Related:\u00a0FCC Chairman Pledges to Undo Net Neutrality RulesThe Honorable Ajit PaiChairman Federal Communications Commission445 12th Street SWWashington, DC 20554Chairman Pai:As a group of startups, entrepreneurs, investors, and the organizations who support them from all 50 states, we were excited to hear about your recent regional tour with startups and innovators and learn about your plans to drive better, faster broadband deployment across the U.S.During your tour, you noted that \"High-speed Internet access, or broadband, is giving rise to what I have called the democratization of entrepreneurship. With a powerful plan and a digital connection, you can raise capital, start a business, immediately reach a worldwide customer base, and disrupt an entire industry.\" We couldn\u2019t agree more. Each of our businesses is an example of the sort of innovation and investment that meaningful broadband access has fueled.But the success of America\u2019s startup ecosystem depends on more than improved broadband speeds. We also depend on an open Internet -- including enforceable net neutrality rules that ensure big cable companies can\u2019t discriminate against people like us. We\u2019re deeply concerned with your intention to undo the existing legal framework.Without net neutrality, the incumbents who provide access to the Internet would be able to pick winners or losers in the market. They could impede traffic from our services in order to favor their own services or established competitors. Or they could impose new tolls on us, inhibiting consumer choice. Those actions directly impede an entrepreneur\u2019s ability to \u201cstart a business, immediately reach a worldwide customer base, and disrupt an entire industry.\u201d Our companies should be able to compete with incumbents on the quality of our products and services, not our capacity to pay tolls to Internet access providers.Fortunately, in 2015 the Federal Communications Commission put in place light touch net neutrality rules that not only prohibit certain harmful practices, but also allow the Commission to develop and enforce rules to address new forms of discrimination. We are concerned by reports that you would replace this system with a set of minimum voluntary commitments, which would give a green light for Internet access providers to discriminate in unforeseen ways.Rather than dismantling regulations that allow the startup ecosystem to thrive, we urge you to focus instead on policies that would promote a stronger Internet for everyone. We applaud efforts to remove unnecessary barriers to construction of new networks, which would foster increased competition and faster, more affordable, open Internet access. We appreciate your consideration and stand at the ready to provide insights that support this work.Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

      "content": "With all the attention surrounding outsourcing, some might be surprised that it\u2019s lost a bit of steam recently.\u00a0According to an Information Services Group study, traditional outsourcing\u00a0fell 25 percent\u00a0during the last quarter of 2016, in comparison to the last quarter of 2015.Related:\u00a05 Things Small Businesses Should OutsourceThis dip, the industry\u2019s largest since 2009, raises important questions for small companies, most notably: Which tasks are worth keeping in house, and which ones should be doled out to the experts?Most companies wait until a round of funding comes through before outsourcing. Accounting and HR can afford that, but needs like legal consultation should go external from day one, no matter how much capital you have on hand.Going external helps efficiency.Some entrepreneurs fear outsourcing could have adverse internal effects -- specifically,outsourcing could impact a company\u2019s productivity.However, a\u00a0Deloitte survey\u00a0on global outsourcing positions outsourcing not only as an approach that doesn\u2019t dampen productivity, but one that also sparks innovation, which can further boost productivity. Fifty-nine percent of survey respondents said outsourcing reduces costs, 47 percent believed it\u2019s useful in finding unique ways to address capacity issues and 29 percent thought it boosts a company\u2019s chances to scale globally.With those three variables looming large in the productivity of any growing company, these numbers point to outsourcing as a trend startups should buy into. It\u2019s just a matter of figuring out how to make it work best for your company.Related:\u00a05 Tasks Entrepreneurs Are Better Off OutsourcingDeciding when\u00a0and what to outsource can seem tricky, but your primary objective should always be to keep production moving. These three tips can help your team make the most of outsourcing without losing any speed:1. Decide what\u2019s a must-have.\u00a0What\u00a0can\u00a0be outsourced successfully is occasionally a surprise. List what is -- and isn\u2019t -- mission-critical for your company, then decide on outsourcing from there.Related:\u00a0These 25 Successful Startups Were Built With Outsourced DevelopmentSlack founder Stewart Butterfield outsourced\u00a0the workplace messaging app\u2019s\u00a0development -- and the creation of its logo and website -- to an agency.\u00a0Butterfield and his team play-tested the design and tweaked it, based on feedback, before releasing it. Within two weeks of its release, Slack received 15,000 invitation requests; and DMR covered Slack\u2019s current stats, which showed the company at\u00a05 million\u00a0daily active users and counting.A great rule of thumb is for a startup team to have a clear understanding of what the company\u2019s mission is so resources can be preserved for that work. Spending time on this process on the front end will get the ball rolling and free up time on the back end.2. Adopt an old-school mindset.\u00a0Nothing beats a real-life recommendation when it comes to connecting with outsourced providers who can meet your needs without becoming a drain on the company. Our firm frequently receives referrals from startups that found out about us through other companies we\u2019ve worked with.Whether it\u2019s at a conference, a shared workspace or a happy hour, face-to-face networking with other founders is invaluable.\u00a0\u201cWho are you using for _______?\u201d\u00a0is an easy question to ask, and it may save you a lot of headaches in the long run.3. Leverage existing service providers.\u00a0Once you find a high-quality outsourced service provider, remember that the company can frequently offer resources in areas beyond its specialty. Asking these service providers whom they\u00a0work with can initiate unexpected solutions -- these service providers typically work across all industries because the operational foundations of many businesses are very similar.GitHub CIO Scott Chacon met the company\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Chris Wanstrath, at a chance meetup in San Francisco. Upon hearing about Chacon\u2019s knowledge of Git, Wanstrath brought him in as\u00a0a consultant\u00a0for what would eventually become Gist, a GitHub sharing feature.Related:\u00a0In-House or Outsourced? How Do You Decide?Outsourcing can create great opportunities for small companies without hampering their productivity. If they can determine when sending work out will work better than keeping it in-house, they can take advantage of the resources offered by the connections they already have and continue operating at a high frequency.Gadiel Morantes\u00a0is the president at\u00a0Early Growth Financial Services,\u00a0which addresses the lack of on-demand financial support available to startups.

      "content": "Is your regular four-wheeled driving experience getting you down? Wondering when our Back to the Future/Jetsons style transportation future will arrive?Today, startup Kitty Hawk -- named as a nod to the work of aeronautical pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright -- released a video of its first product, an entirely electric aircraft called the Kitty Hawk Flyer.The company\u2019s CEO is Sebastian Thrun, who founded Google X, which was responsible for innovations such as Google Glass, balloon internet connectivity initiative Project Loon and self-driving cars.Google co-founder Larry Page is an investor in the company, and in a statement to The New York Times said, \u201cWe\u2019ve all had dreams of flying effortlessly. I\u2019m excited that one day very soon I\u2019ll be able to climb onto my Kitty Hawk Flyer for a quick and easy personal flight.\u201dThe company describes the vehicle as \u201csafe, tested and legal to operate in the United States in uncongested areas under the Ultralight category of FAA regulations. We\u2019ve designed our first version specifically to fly over water. You don\u2019t need a pilot\u2019s license and you\u2019ll learn to fly it in minutes.\u201dRelated:\u00a0Here's How People Really Feel About Flying CarsNo word just yet on how much the vehicle will cost when it goes on sale at the end of the year, but it\u2019s probably not going to be cheap.Potential customers currently have the option to plunk down $100 for a three-year membership that gets them access to events where they will get to see flight demonstrations and a chance to take one for a spin before it hits the market. That, and a place on the waitlist and a $2,000 discount off of the retail price.In other flying car news, Uber will host a three-day conference in Dallas starting Tuesday focused on \"on-demand, urban air transportation.\"Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

      "title": "All the News From Facebook's F8 Conference",
      "content": "Since Facebook\u2019s 2017 F8 Developer Conference kicked off on Tuesday, the social media giant has made a raft of announcements about the new features it has in the works. From advances in augmented reality to virtual assistants, read on for the latest offerings from Mark Zuckerberg and company.During his keynote, Zuckerberg highlighted various forms of AR technology that could soon appear on our smartphones. He previewed tools that will allow users to place virtual objects in real places, such as a note on a refrigerator or artwork on blank white walls. In one demonstration, he showcased the ability to turn flat images into 3D scenes and overlay directions or set up a gameboard.Two tools within the Facebook app\u2019s camera are now available. AR Studio is in closed beta, and developers can apply for access to create effects based on object detection (think virtual steam billowing from a cup of coffee). Frame Studio is available to the public and allows users to create their own image filters and overlays.The company announced the beta launch of a social virtual reality app called Facebook Spaces. If you own an Oculus Rift headset, with the app, you can make a cartoon avatar of yourself, and you and three friends can virtually hang out in just about any setting you can imagine, from Paris to outer space.Related:\u00a0Why Mark Zuckerberg Is Excited About an Augmented Reality FutureFor those who have held off downloading the Messenger app until this point, it seems that Facebook is hoping to lure more users with the promise of a more multilevel experience. Messenger will soon integrate the ability to play games such as Words With Friends, and an Apple Music extension is on its way, on top of the current partnership with Spotify. Users can also look forward to a mobile payments function in Messenger for purchases such as event tickets.M, Facebook\u2019s answer to Siri or Alexa, will now be able to drop into users\u2019 conversations in Messenger. If someone asks a question about what to order for dinner, M can offer suggestions and then launch a window within the app where the user can make a purchase through a third party.Related:\u00a021 Hidden Facebook Features Only Power Users KnowAt F8, the company also launched Chat Extensions. Now in Messenger, a chat bot can be a group experience, rather than a one-on-one interaction. For example, a group might use theScore\u2019s bot to follow a game or Kayak\u2019s to make travel plans.Owing to Zuckerberg\u2019s goal of merging the digital and physical worlds, Facebook and Udacity are partnering to organize meetups in cities all over the country, where developers can learn new skills and work together.At the conference, Regina Dugan, the head of the company\u2019s research and development moonshot division Building 8, said that she and her team are currently working on a neural interface that would enable someone to type with just their mind -- up to 100 words per minute.Building 8 is also developing skin sensor technology that would essentially allow someone to hear through their skin. The team is at work on software and hardware that would make the skin mimic the way that the ear and brain process sound frequencies. This artificial cochlea would allow the brain to recognize symbols, words and patterns based on what a person touches.At F8, the company also rolled out a pair of Surround 360-degree cameras -- the x24 and x6. The cameras will be completed later this year. The company plans to license the technology to manufacturers in lieu of an open-source model. Last year, a 360-degree camera was announced at F8. It reportedly cost more than $25,000 to produce.Facebook laid out a few initiatives at F8 toward its goal of providing internet connectivity in places that do not currently have access. Tether-Tennas are tethered helicopters meant to act as a backup when natural disasters interrupt connections. Another program, the Terragraph project, uses antennas to close wireless coverage gaps in cities. The ongoing Aquila project is working on drones to provide internet connectivity.During the conference, Michael Abrash, the chief scientist at Oculus Research, made the prediction that by 2022, augmented reality glasses will be available to consumers, and they could eclipse the popularity of the cell phone.Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

      "title": "Bots for Messenger Are the Marketplace 'Goldilocks,' and This Man Would Know.",
      "content": "Though his title may be a mouthful, The Global Director of Platforms and Product Partnerships for Messenger at Facebook has a singular vision: to make technology that levels the playing field for every person, no matter what. Anand Chandrasekaran is doing just that with Messenger, helping to further develop strategies for Messenger that have been incredibly successful, including the integration of open-API chatbots into Messenger.Messenger, which has more than one billion monthly users and more than 100,000 active developers building bots and AI powered conversational experiences, is one of Chandrasekaran\u2019s passions. In his previous posts as CPO of Snapdeal and Bharti Airtel, Chandrasekaran was a leader at some of the world\u2019s leading enterprises, and his own experience launching successful startups has given him unique insight into what both developers and consumers want and need from the AI that is coming onto the market today.I meet Chandrasekaran at Shoptalk and in the first of an in-person, two-part interview, I asked Chandrasekaran to give me a look into what wisdom he\u2019s gleaned on bots, and how they will play a role in enterprise in the future.Related:\u00a0Top 10 Best Chatbot Platform Tools to Build Chatbots for Your BusinessNewlands: What is your opinion on how bots are functioning in today\u2019s marketplace, and what specifically stands out to you?\u00a0 Chandrasekaran: I think it\u2019s a very exciting time right now. As we took in all of the excitement about the platform, what we realized was: bots are not a one-size-fits-all use case. People want a variety of development options. What I mean by that is that businesses and developers want to know the customer really well, and then provide a great experience for them. For example, in the case of Gyant, they are a bot that offers a symptoms check for the Zika virus and offers other health-related information. They ask a lot of information to gain context, and sometimes they even ask for evidence or photos of the symptoms. Obviously, there are a lot of questions. But what they find is about 90% of the time, people who start on question number one get through all of the questions. This is one of the awesome things about Messenger platform experiences: you can make it super conversational while getting to know the customer.But not every experience requires this type of approach, like in the instance of airlines or telecom companies. They\u2019ve invested a lot in certain flows. They\u2019ve understood how their customers do what they do, and they\u2019ve mapped it out in terms of user experiences. Our goal is that the platform should empower them to leverage their existing infrastructure while still enabling them to build new and engaging experiences to make their customer interactions even better. So, today you can have a combination of a conversational and visual experience. For example, if someone wants to buy roses, they should be able to see a visual of flowers. But if you\u2019re just saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to a number of questions, then it\u2019s better to have conversational experience rather than open up something or having to click out of Messenger.What we are trying to do is give developers the canvas to build these creative opportunities. In messaging, what people find is while they like to be really expressive and share a lot of content, they also like the immediacy; the person asks a question and I just say \u201cyes.\u201d The answers to, \u201cWhat can a bot do,\u201d are becoming far broader now. It can be a great user experience for airlines, or a telephone company, or a sports team offering experiences to their users. We are also seeing a lot of celebrities using chatbots to build relationships with their fans. A lot of celebrities are becoming entrepreneurs in their own right, and they are building one-to-one relationships with their fans, which is not unlike a brand developing relationships with their loyal customers.Related:\u00a0How to Create a Facebook Messenger Chatbot For Free Without CodingNewlands:\u00a0What is your perspective on people selling through Messenger?Chandrasekaran:\u00a0We want to extend that opportunity to anyone who can benefit, though we feel very strongly about needing to set some guidelines on what constitutes a spammy experience for the consumers -- and that\u2019s probably the only thing that we have a strong opinion about. We want Messenger to be a place where people feel comfortable getting high-quality signals and high-quality communication. I think our stand will be strong in that area, and somewhat unwavering.Related:\u00a07 Ways\u00a0Chatbots\u00a0Can Benefit Your Marketing StrategyNewlands:\u00a0If a business wants to sign customers up for a user experience, but then wants to sell products, are you in favor of that?Chandrasekaran:\u00a0What we find is that selling a product to a consumer is a conversation. Nobody comes to any platform and just buys. They have some questions, they want to choose from a couple of options, they might want to check if it\u2019s the right size. Even in the real world, people like to have a conversation about what they are buying. In that regard, we feel that bots lend themselves nicely to a conversational user experience.In addition, there are only two options for consumers right now: the very low commitment experience of mobile web, and then the very high commitment experience of apps. For mobile web you don\u2019t need your users to do anything --\u00a0 they go to the page, but they\u2019re probably not logged in, their payment information is not there, and so on. On the high end, they\u2019ve got an app, and all their stuff is there, but it\u2019s a pretty high bar for someone to go download something and set it up. I think there is an intermediate experience, where people already have Messenger as do over a billion people, and already have a great\u00a0experience\u00a0on Messenger, so they are in between.Not to get very Goldilocks about it, but it\u2019s neither on one end of the spectrum or the other; it\u2019s just right in terms of level of level of commitment and user experience.Murray Newlands is an entrepreneur, investor, business advisor and speaker.

      "title": "TaskRabbit's Co-Founder Aims to Simplify 401(k)s With New Venture",
      "content": "Kevin Busque says he was confounded. He just couldn't understand it.It was 2012, and of all the employees at his company, TaskRabbit, he estimated that only around 34 percent had signed up for a 401(k). So he held an informal discussion with them to dig into this issue. It turned out, this group of Silicon Valley workers found the whole system too confusing.\"It was very clear the younger generation was not investing even though they were the ones that were really interested in savings,\" says Busque, who co-founded TaskRabbit with his wife, Leah. \"So there was an issue there, and it kind of smacked me in the face a few times. The system is completely broken.\"Related: The 10 Best Cities for RetirementSo he made it his goal to replace ADP, the company's 401(k) provider, with something digital that offered investment advice. But after searching for something like that on the internet, Busque says he came up empty. So he did what any entrepreneur would do: He decided to build his own solution.The result of those efforts is Guideline, an online-only 401(k) provider that launched last August after about two and a half years of work. The company spent the bulk of that time building a system to keep records, an essential part of any operation that deals in 401(k)s in terms of client privacy and legal compliance. Guideline charges an upfront $500 fee then $8 per participant a month, and it integrates employees' plans with a business's payroll provider and has an opt-out system, contrary to many traditional firms' confusing opt-in processes.According to Busque, the model is already a huge success. Guideline is bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars every month and is \"almost forking over to profitability.\" It's also the exclusive 401(k) provider for Gusto, the unicorn payroll company.\u201cKevin is a remarkable entrepreneur -- visionary and humble at the same time,\" says Tomer London, chief product officer and co-founder of Gusto. \"We love working with him as he\u2019s truly committed to enabling more people to save towards better retirement.\"Related: 3 Steps to Secure a Rich RetirementBusque is not alone in his goal: Captain401, ForUsAll and Money Intelligence also aim to use technology to simplify 401(k)s. Honest Dollar hopes to do the same with IRAs. Feex says it helps people root out fees in their retirement accounts. There are also startups that help people invest, such as Stash and Betterment.To grasp the appeal of these startups, it's important to understand the main players in the 401(k) industry, such as Great-West Financial, ADP and Fidelity. Employers enroll for their services, and employees can sign up for an account based on their employer's HR policies. For plans that require employees to opt in, participation rates hover around 69 percent for businesses with 100 or more employees and 36 percent for smaller companies. Plans with automatic enrollment see much greater participation.Anyone who's ever had to sign up for a 401(k) knows how confusing it can be.\"To be honest, nobody takes finance classes other than nerds like me,\" Tim Guilford, a registered principal at Raymond James Financial Services, told USA Today. \"So when you're presented on your first day of work with a list of all our funds and asked how much you want to put in our plan, people are poorly equipped to make those decisions.\"And because many 401(k) providers aren't allowed to offer financial advice, many people just choose options that sound good. Meanwhile, the firms also take in fees, which has led to several lawsuits. And they don't even have to work in your best interests, as President Donald Trump delayed an Obama administration rule that would have required financial institutions to do so. (Last Week Tonight With John Oliver did a digestible segment on the industry's problems.)Guideline recommends plans not only based on your age, but your family status and where you live. The app will ask you about life changes every year. It's a solution built for today's internet consumers, or \"the most employee-focused 401(k) for small business,\" as Busque puts it.Related: This Startup Aims to Help Older Professionals Find Jobs\"I like to solve problems with technology,\" he says. \"[Businesses] don't know that they have access to great 401(k)s and participants want great 401(k)s with low fees. They don't trust banks. They don't trust brokers. We're not either of those. We have to do what's in the best interest of the plan participant.\"He sees Guideline, which employs about 35 people, as a software company that is \"B2B2C.\" And while the ethos in Silicon Valley is to disrupt industries, Busque says that wasn't the right approach with Guideline.Stephen J.

      "title": "How to Hit It Out of the Park With Your Audience",
      "content": "In Major League Baseball today, teams strive to build winning franchises and billion-dollar businesses that reach far beyond the diamond by capitalizing on a wide spectrum of markets and audiences. Nowhere has that journey been more dramatic than in the wired heart of San Francisco\u2019s high-tech universe, where the San Francisco Giants have excelled on several fronts.Last season,\u00a0the team hit a major milestone and moved just behind the Boston Red Sox to steal the second-longest sellout streak in Major League Baseball from the Cleveland Indians, selling out 456 consecutive regular-season games at AT&T Park.\u00a0What\u2019s more widely known are the team's\u00a0World Series wins in 2010, 2012 and 2014, and while we\u2019re about to kickoff an \u201codd year\u201d the 2017 squad has back many of the star players that brought\u00a0them victory in years past. What\u2019s more,\u00a0 even in the down years when the team wasn\u2019t winning the pennant, the Giants sold every seat. Since opening the new ballpark doors in 2000, the team has welcomed more than 50 million fans.Related: 5 Essentials For Connecting With Your Ideal Target Market on Social MediaThe Giants have done it by appointing executives with a keen sense of product-market fit, such as SVP and CIO Bill Schlough, who became the first CIO ever appointed by a professional sports team when he joined the Giants in April 1999. I recently had the chance to speak with Schlough, who shared lessons he\u2019s learned over the years. He covered the intricacies involved in fostering a brand that maintains one of the most loyal fan bases in sports today. Many of Schlough\u2019s lessons translate for startup founders building their target audience and customer base in highly competitive markets.The Giants don\u2019t only compete on the field, Schlough said. \u201cWe think of ourselves as a member of several markets: baseball, broadcast, entertainment, real estate. But, ultimately, we\u2018re in the happiness business. Our product is bringing joy to our fans.\u201dOf course, different people have very different ideas of what joy is -- and not everyone who goes to a Giants game is there solely for the joy of baseball. As Schlough noted, \u201cIf we just focused on baseball fans, we\u2019d sell 15,000 to 20,000 tickets each game. There\u2019s much more to it than that.\u201dThere\u2019s garlic fries, of course. There\u2019s Wi-Fi (the Giants were the first team to install it). There are craft beers and a new \u201cvirtual reality experience.\u201d Additionally, there are special events that target specific demographics, such as Jerry Garcia Tribute Night, Cancer Awareness Night and Yoga Day. There is a Star Wars Day and even a Peanut Allergy Friendly Day. In all, there are 33 special days and nights that attract fans that otherwise might not buy a ticket to a baseball game. By targeting specific demographics with added features to the game-viewing experience, the Giants are able to attract additional viewership that would otherwise be absent.Related: 10 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn from America's National PastimeFans these days -- and particularly fans in San Francisco -- demand top-flight technology perks. They want connectivity, multimedia viewing options and even virtual reality. All are vital to selling tickets.But, Schlough warned that it\u2019s not always an advantage to being an early adopter of seemingly cool technology, noting, \u201cYou can\u2019t be an early adopter in everything.\u201d While it\u2019s nice to be first to implement a new technology, it doesn\u2019t come without pain. It can be extremely valuable to take advantage of your competitors testing out new technologies and then learn from their mistakes.Schlough and his team first focused on tech-centric perks like Wi-Fi, dynamic pricing and seat upgrades. But, even these were challenging to execute at first. Though an eventual success, pervasive and reliable connectivity was difficult. Electric turnstiles for transferable tickets and upgrades also seemed like a great idea, and although it was buggy at first, new scanning technology rendered the original system obsolete.Related: When to Upgrade From IT Staff to CIOThese experiences reminded the Giants that it almost always takes consumer feedback and trial and error before great ideas work well.Ultimately, these are lessons that almost any business should take to heart when thinking about its position in the marketplace. Businesses should also remember that efforts should be focused on their target market first, because even the best product can\u2019t entice everyone. And when they add new features and products, it needs to be done deliberately, all the while being flexible to insert key consumer feedback back into the product. After all, you can\u2019t make the market fit your product, but you can always pivot to get the perfect product-market fit.\u00a0Sean\u00a0Jacobsohn is a venture investor at Norwest Venture Partners and former SaaS executive with broad technology, sales and business development expertise.

      "title": "Why Mark Zuckerberg Is Excited About an Augmented Reality Future",
      "content": "When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg took the stage today to open F8, the social giant\u2019s annual developer conference, he wanted to address the elephant in the room. Another big tentpole event named F8 had already kind of stolen his thunder: the recent premiere of his buddy Vin Diesel\u2019s latest movie, the eight installment of the Fast and the Furious franchise.Moving on to his main focus, Zuckerberg shared with the crowd Facebook\u2019s mission going forward, riffing quite literally on the\u00a0comprehensive treatise he published in February (he held up a sizable stack of paper that may or may not have been the printed open letter). The Facebook founder said the company's next steps would be to bring the digital and physical together and to \u201cwork on building common ground.\u201dTo that end, Facebook\u2019s next technological leap, now that it is the owner of four out of the five most downloaded apps in the world, is to step into the world of augmented reality. But Facebook isn\u2019t the only company with designs on augmented reality.Related: Watch Mark Zuckerberg 3-D-Print a Mini Version of His DogThis week, Snap rolled out an AR feature that lets users add special effects to their photos, in addition to the already popular face mask effects, according to The Wall Street Journal. Other major companies dipping into AR include Microsoft, Google and Apple.Zuckerberg announced that today will see the beta launch of an open AR platform through a new camera function of the app that will allow developers to create their own filters and frames.He also shared what future AR innovations could look like. He offered an example of a still photo that could be transformed into a 3D scene, where the user could pan around, change lighting and add effects such as filling the room with water, bouncing balls or skittles.Related: Watch Mark Zuckerberg Ask Fellow Harvard Dropout Bill Gates for Advice on His Harvard Commencement SpeechZuckerberg spoke about transforming blank walls into street art and how AR could be used to leave notes for friends in specific places, such as marking a table at your favorite bar or leaving a note for your spouse on the refrigerator.\u201cThis is going to be an important technology that changes how we use our phones,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cThere is a long road map of technology to build for years. I am confident that we are going to push this augmented reality platform forward.\u201d That long road map included creating glasses and eventually contacts to see the world through an augmented reality lens.Meanwhile, the Facebook CEO took a moment to offer his and the company\u2019s condolences to the family of Robert Godwin, Sr., whose alleged killer posted a video of his murder on the social network and then confessed in a live video. Police say the alleged killer, Steve Stephens, took his own life on Tuesday.Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

      "title": "These Are the Top Mixed Reality Companies in the World Today",
      "content": "In mixed reality technology, which includes virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), there are some companies that you cannot avoid watching. They include most of the world\u2019s biggest, richest and most innovative personal tech companies.\u00a0This group includes Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Sony, Nintendo, Huawei\u00a0and others. I think the most important company to watch is Apple, who will begin to announce a myriad of devices all connecting to its new iPhone. This will trigger a rapid escalation of AR and VR adoption.That said, I see all sorts of categories that are ripe for the private sector and early-phase companies to enjoy rapid and significant growth. In many of these niches, there is more than one promising player.Related: Virtual Reality Is About to Change Your BusinessI asked experts Robert Scoble and Shel Israel of the Transformation Group, LLC, a consulting firm dedicated to helping big brands develop and implement mixed reality (MR) strategies, to help me examine the hundreds of mixed reality organizations to uncover the best positioned and the wherewithal to scale quickly.Mark Zuckerberg has called VR the most social platform he has ever seen, and we agree. It is different and far more experiential than social media. It allows people located all over the world\u00a0to share experiences in a single virtual space. This can range from playing games,\u00a0to touring historic points of interest,\u00a0to new forms of distance learning, to corporate training experiences.There are five companies that we believe show promise in this area:Every aspect of entertainment is embracing mixed reality:\u00a0players, fans and sponsors. Some niches, such as playing games, have been obvious to most observers. Others are not so obvious.Music. In mixed reality, people think mostly about 3D visual experiences. But, there is also stereoscopic music, which enables listeners to be immersed in the middle of the band or orchestra pit. MicrodoseVR provides one of the wildest experiences we know. As the company name implies it is like being on a small dose of LSD, as the music hits you from all sides, vivid 3D imagery shapeshifts in time to the music all around you, and you undulate to the beat with others who may be in their living rooms thousands of miles away.Sports. Mixed reality is being used to enhance fan experiences of just about every sport including the NBA, NFL and the PGA. The companies to watch are the startups that are gaining traction at delivering mixed reality experiences to fans on a global level. The one that so far impresses us the most is NextVR, which partners with Fox, the NBA, CNN and others to provide AR fan experiences in major sports. For example, fans can watch an NBA VR Game of the Week.\u00a0Related: 7 New Opportunities Virtual Reality May CreateSearch remains the most popular application in the current 2D, but as the people behind Google and Bing search are aware search changes dramatically when it moves into immersive technologies. Internal mapping is allowing people to find all the blue jeans available in a mall, perhaps while shoppers are escorted by the virtual celebrity of their choice.In fact, it is far bigger than that. Every square centimeter of the planet is being 3D mapped. It is the core of the great transformation that moves us from smartphones to smart glasses. It also makes search more visual. We will search for things by image so that barriers of language disappear. A company we are watching is Sketchfab, an NYC-based startup that allows people to search for and share more than a million 3D objects through use of a VR headset. Each object can be rotated to allow the searcher to look\u00a0at an object from all possible perspectives.Related: 5 Startup Ideas for Jumping Into Virtual RealityWhile they are a small step short of being VR or AR, 360\u00b0 cameras have shrunk from over $10,000 to under $100 in just a few short years. These cameras can now be clipped onto your smartphone, where an app allows you to become the center of a photo that surrounds you in all six directions.\u00a0These cameras\u00a0are constantly improving in quality and affordability. They have not yet become a commodity, but they are well on their way. The four we like the best: Insta360, which has cameras ranging from $3500 down to $129; Giroptic, which is praised for ease of use; JauntVR for the cinematically inclined; and our favorite, 8i, which is leading in volumetric human capture, a technology that makes virtual humans increasingly lifelike.The headsets of tomorrow are the equivalent of the smartphone of today. Like phones, the componentry is vital to the product, particularly important is the quality of optics, and Lumus seems to be making the best. They could become the \u201cIntel Inside\u201d of the next generation of hardware.Of course, the big players will dominate in the headset area. As we stated, we expect Apple to be a big winner in his area. But, it will not be the only winner, and some of the players may not be brands you know today.\u00a0Related: How Augmented Reality Will Shape the Future of EcommerceThere are two headset companies, you may not have heard of that we would definitely watch.ODG\u00a0is the first commercially successful AR headset company.\u00a0Founded before the turn of the century, the San Francisco-based, privately held company is working on its eighth generation headset and is the product of choice for many enterprises and government organizations, particularly the military. We would not be surprised for it to cut a deal for a consumer-level headset in the next two to three years.\u00a0We are also optimistic about the future of Meta. The Israeli-born company, now located in Silicon Valley, has raised nearly $200 million, most notably from Lenovo. We recently saw a preview of the not-yet-announced Meta3 and were impressed on several levels. This is another company focused now on enterprise customers that just might find its way onto the retail shelf -- perhaps via Lenovo.\u00a0We also see a bright future for Daqri, a more recently started headset company that serves hardhat applications ranging from construction to oil rigs to jet fighter pilots and perhaps someday into football or motorcycle racing. The AR helmets are\u00a0tough\u00a0and relatively lightweight.\u00a0Related: How This Augmented Reality Company Hopes to Compete With Microsoft and GoogleAs we move from handsets to headsets, we will interact with devices in new ways, leaving the hands mostly free to do other things.

      "title": "4 Lessons for Entrepreneurs From Africa's Solar Industry",
      "content": "In my opinion, the next hotbed of innovation is Africa, specifically the nations of South Africa, Rwanda\u00a0and Kenya. Numerous industries are being disrupted at the moment, from the African mobile money market -- the undisputed leader of which is Kenyan startup M-Pesa --\u00a0to job hunting, by South Africa\u2019s Giraffe, a mobile recruitment app for low-income workers without internet, but with smartphones.Yet the largest revolution that\u2019s sweeping across the continent\u2019s emerging markets is in renewable energy, specifically solar power. Today, solar is growing so quickly that\u00a0of the nearly 600 million Africans living off-grid, experts estimate that approximately 10 percent\u00a0are using clean, renewable energy to power their homes.Related: 11 African Entrepreneurs Who Are Changing the Business LandscapeSo how did solar come to dominate Africa so thoroughly? And specifically, what lessons can American business owners learn from the ingenious, resourceful entrepreneurs operating in the challenging conditions of the African continent? Plenty, as it turns out.Without a doubt, solar energy faces considerable obstacles, not only in Africa, but internationally as well. The biggest barrier may well be integration into existing infrastructure, particularly power grids, which may not be able to accommodate the variability of solar\u00a0-- cloudy days produce less power, for example.African solar startups have taken this reality into consideration. They understand that building large solar farms, then connecting homes with extensive power grids is a lengthy undertaking that, absent public and government backing, can take years, if not decades. Instead, entrepreneurs have seized upon decentralization, skipping big infrastructure to bring power directly to the people.Take M-Kopa, arguably the leader in African solar energy. The company\u2019s bundle, which costs $35, provides a solar panel, multi-device charger, several charging cables, lights, radio\u00a0and a SIM card for mobile payment. M-Kopa has already sold 300,000 kits across Kenya, Uganda\u00a0and Tanzania, leapfrogging extant power grids entirely and empowering their customers. Now that\u2019s not to say that big solar farms don\u2019t exist; rather, they\u2019re far less prevalent, and much less important, than the small-scale, personalized touch of a startup like M-Kopa.The lesson here? Rather than relying on large, centralized networks, devise a decentralized, low-cost solution that could reach hundreds of thousands of households. One such example is Blockstack, a startup that uses the encryption-based technology Blockchain to guarantee anonymity while surfing the web.Related to the above tenet of decentralization, it\u2019s important to note that while government subsidies and intervention can help your business, such assistance may never come.This is doubly true when it comes to many African nations. Consider this -- in 2014, Transparency International estimated that nearly 75 million Africans were forced to pay bribes\u00a0-- often for access to basic services like water, sanitation\u00a0and yes, electricity. Furthermore, poverty and bribery are inextricably linked, and\u00a0as a result, those who pay the most bribes are also those least able to afford it.Related: From Bootstrapped Startup to More than $1 Million in Annual RevenueWith that in mind, two entrepreneurs founded Juabar, a Tanzanian franchise centered around small, solar-powered kiosks that offer cell phone charging. Rather than wait for the government to build the requisite infrastructure, Juabar\u2019s two founders simply stepped in and created a network of solar powered, micro-entrepreneurs. Such franchise owners earn, on average, between $75-150 per month, in a nation where the monthly average is around $45 per month. In the future, Juabar plans to offer Wi-Fi and other information services.The lesson here? At the risk of getting political, it\u2019s true that certain, well-established industries receive a lot of funding and subsidies from the government. But if you\u2019re an underdog, don\u2019t despair. Even if the government ignores your industry in favor of those with powerful lobbies, you still have a fighting chance. How? Use low-tech, decentralized solutions, start at the grassroots level, and remember to...Given that disruption is the mantra for the digital age, this one should come as no surprise. To return to the case of M-Kopa, the startup\u2019s success --\u00a0a $19 million round of funding in 2015\u00a0--\u00a0owes a lot to the convergence of two factors.First, consider that solar panels have been declining in cost. In America alone, the price of solar panels has dropped by 5 percent\u00a0for residential households, and 12 percent\u00a0for large-scale solar farms. Further, some reports estimate that the costs of solar energy will drop 60 percent\u00a0by 2040, to three cents per kilowatt hour, which is far cheaper than gas or coal in many areas.Second, recall the earlier mention of Africa\u2019s burgeoning mobile payments market, led by startups like Kenya\u2019s M-Pesa. Developed by Vodafone and its African partner Safaricom, M-Pesa revolutionized the payment landscape, allowing users to pay off anything from cab rides to M-Kopa\u2019s solar energy bills. In fact, MIT researchers have found that services like M-Pesa improve access to capital by the poor and increase their consumption -- a boon to startups like M-Kopa.The lesson here? Leverage existing and emerging\u00a0tech to carry out your core business better, faster\u00a0and cheaper than the competition.Financing is something of a dilemma. Without a solid financing plan, potential customers won\u2019t be able to buy your product or service. But if your plan is perceived as unfair, you\u2019re likely to lose customers.Take a look at Off Grid Electric, another solar energy startup that\u2019s quite similar to M-Kopa. Rather than force their customers to pay off loans at exaggerated interest rates, OGE charges its customers $7 a month for services. After three years, customers own their own unit. Considering that it costs around $100-140 per year for kerosene lamps and candles, users can save a lot of money by paying off their OGE unit within three years.Related: 5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Worldwide Can Learn From Israeli CultureThe lesson here? Balance company profits with customer interest to provide a win-win situation for everyone. After all, happy customers are repeat customers, and you can bet that both OGE and M-Kopa have ancillary products to offer.Ultimately, given the numerous challenges that African solar energy startups face, it\u2019s logical that they would have much to teach entrepreneurs the world over. Ultimately, their most important lesson may well be the vital role of creativity. After all, without a forward-thinking vision and the courage to challenge existing circumstances, none of these innovative companies would exist today.Dr. Ping Jiang is one of the world\u2019s foremost macro traders, due to his successful track record of investing in emerging markets and undervalued investment vehicles.

      "content": "The latest autonomous robots to hit the streets with food delivery orders are from Marble, a San Francisco startup that is partnering with Yelp to navigate crowded city streets and deliver your pad thai before it gets cold.Marble's robots are about waist-height, a bit larger than the dog-sized models of its competitor\u00a0Starship. They're also brimming with technology borrowed from self-driving cars. Each Marble delivery bot -- there are a few of them cruising the streets of San Francisco's Mission and Potrero Hill neighborhoods -- includes lidar, cameras\u00a0and ultrasonic sensors to monitor their surroundings.The idea is that they can avoid pedestrians and safely use crosswalks by relying on the sensor data to locate themselves on the super-accurate 3D maps that Marble is building. The company says it plans to map the majority of San Francisco's sidewalks over the coming year. That map-assisted approach is the same approach that many automakers are taking for self-driving cars, too, including Cadillac's upcoming\u00a0Super Cruise\u00a0system.Visitors and San Francisco residents can order delivery from Yelp's Eat24 app for a chance to be served by a Marble bot. If you're selected, you'll be offered the opportunity to accept the service\u00a0and the restaurant will then pack your order into one of the robots' cargo bays. Once it arrives, you'll enter an access code to unlock your breakfast, lunch\u00a0or dinner.Although delivery robots are still relatively rare, the Marble-Yelp partnership comes as the technology is ripening and the market is heating up. In January, Starship announced\u00a0partnerships\u00a0with DoorDash and Postmates to deliver food and other goods within a four-mile range. Last month, Starship also began\u00a0delivering pizza\u00a0from Domino's locations in Germany and the Netherlands. If those trials are successful, Domino's could expand the service to more of its 2,000-plus\u00a0stores worldwide.Tom is PCMag's San Francisco-based news reporter.\u00a0",

      "content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Entrepreneur\u2019s \u201c20 Questions\u201d series features both established and up-and-coming entrepreneurs and asks them a number of questions about what makes them tick, their everyday success strategies and advice for aspiring founders.In the intense world of Silicon Valley, your stock rise and falls by the state of your startup. And for those founders who don\u2019t make it their number one focus, they are often judged harshly.That is something Randi Zuckerberg learned first hand, first as the head of marketing at Facebook during the social media giant\u2019s early years, and then as the CEO and founder of her own marketing firm, Zuckerberg Media.\u201cWhat is life without being a three dimensional person? It\u2019s so boring,\u201d she says of the people who believe a startup should be the only thing on your plate. \u201cHow can you tell someone to put away the things they are passionate about?\u201dIn addition to running Zuckerberg Media, she is a speaker, radio host on SiriusXM and the author of bestselling business and children\u2019s books -- Dot Complicated and Missy President.She is also a lifelong student of technology and explores how it has impacted our lives through her 5-year-old online community, which is also called Dot Complicated. And in 2014, she achieved her childhood dream of making her Broadway debut.We caught up with Zuckerberg and asked her 20 Questions to see what makes her tick.1. How do you start your day?I start my day with a little bit of a cheesy mantra that I\u2019ve been using for about 10 years. It says, \u201cwork, sleep, fitness, family, friends -- pick three.\u201d There is a lot of pressure, especially on women, to do everything well, every single day. I like to give myself permission to do three things really well each day, and it can be a different three tomorrow, as long as it all balances out in the long run.2. How do you end your day?In my ideal mind, I want to do something relaxing, like meditation or yoga. In reality, I\u2019m in bed on social media, on my laptop and on my phone all at the same time. That\u2019s an area of my life that I\u2019m actively trying to work towards. I know that sleep and relaxation is so important, but I would consider myself a work in progress when it comes to the end of the day habits.3. What\u2019s a book that changed your mind and why?Me, Myself and Us by Dr. Brian Little. I struggled for a long time because I\u2019m really an introvert, but I have to act extrovertedly, because I\u2019m giving speeches or meeting with entrepreneurs. I felt very alone in the world and then Dr. Little came out with this book about being pseudo extrovert, and it was all about introverts that have to pretend to be extroverts for their business lives.It totally changed my life and opened up a whole world of thinking for me. The book said if you go out there and have to act extraverted, don\u2019t forget you\u2019re an introvert at the core, which means you\u2019re going to need to build in downtime to your schedule, otherwise you're going to burn out. We don\u2019t run on the same kind of social energy that extroverts do. So I know that if I have a day where I am on camera or giving a talk, I\u2019ll actually build \u201cdo not schedule\u201d blocks of time into my calendar. That\u2019s not something I would have done before his book, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s really effective in my business and personal life4. What\u2019s a book you always recommend and why?Year of Yes by Shonda Rhimes. It\u2019s an awesome book. She\u2019s an incredible woman and I think that we can all get out of our comfort zone a little more.5. What\u2019s a strategy to keep focused?I like to carve out blocks of time that I\u2019m going to be unplugged, which is sometimes frustrating to the rest of my team. But I find that it\u2019s hard to do creative, thoughtful tasks when you are interrupted by emails and text messages. I like to carve out two to three hours, where I do a deep dive into writing a piece or working on a speech. That is the most effective hours of my entire day.Related: This Founder Shares the Mindset That Helps Her Stay On Track6. When you were a kid what did you want to be when you grew up?For a while, I wanted to be a mermaid, but apparently that was not a tangible goal. I really wanted to sing on Broadway. That was my big goal my entire life. I eventually gave it up to go into something reasonable, like technology and entrepreneurship.7. What did you learn from the worst boss you ever had?I learned about how to treat people, but I also learned that is is better to give people feedback in the moment. Early in my career, I had these bosses that would check in with me every six months -- and tell me for last six months that I\u2019ve been doing x, y and z and that\u2019s not good. I\u2019d sit there thinking, \u201cWhy didn't you tell me six months ago, so that I wasn\u2019t just making the same mistakes?\u201d That impacted my own management style, because I always want to give feedback in the moment.8. Who has influenced you most when it comes to how you approach your work?I\u2019m so lucky to have a great mentor in Kathleen Kennedy, who is the president of LucasFilm. She\u2019s given me great advice on what happens when you\u2019re the only woman in the room, and how to find mentorship and peer guidance around you even if you have to look in other industries.We\u2019ve definitely spoken about the fact that sometimes your best mentors are right around you, and you don\u2019t even know. A lot of times we look for someone high above us to be a mentor, but often peer-mentor groups are actually going to be the most effective and helpful.9. What\u2019s a trip that changed you?About a year ago, I traveled to Kuwait. I spoke at one of the first women in business conferences they had in the entire country. It really opened my eyes and challenged my viewpoint. I met some wonderful entrepreneurs that I\u2019m still in touch with on social media. I feel really grateful for that opportunity, and it made me realize that I need to take more trips like that to get out of my own bubble and to expand my view of entrepreneurship in different regions in the world.10. What inspires you?Definitely art, theater, culture. Anytime that I want to feel inspired I go to the theater. I spent so much time in my life building platforms, and it\u2019s easy for techies to forget that platforms are nothing without art to go on them.Related: The Co-Founder of Gilt on What Her First Job at Ebay Taught Her About Running a Company11. What was your first business idea and what did you do with it?A snow-shoveling subscription service when I was in middle school. I grew up in New York, and I was making a little bit of pocket money shoveling our own walkway. I then thought, what if I went door to door and say, here\u2019s my price for today, or you could pre-order for the entire season. If it snows a lot you\u2019ll get a good deal, but it if it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s the risk you take. I had a few houses our block that took me up on it, mostly because the cute neighborhood kid had an idea, but now I see all the subscription services out there, and I think I was a little\u00a0ahead of my time.12. What was an early job that taught you something important or useful?My dad is a semi-professional bridge player, and from a very young age, I used to be an assistant at the bridge club. It was fun, except it gets really stressful during certain times of the match when everyone needs to say their scores at the same time and pretty much every person raises their hand and calls for the caddy, and you have to run like a frantic animal collecting scores. Very early on it taught me about time management, how to deal with difficult and impatient people and how to pace myself and enjoy the downtime between the craziness..13. What\u2019s the best advice you ever took?Someone once told me, when we were talking about how easy it is to Google yourself and go on social media and see what they are saying about you, they said to me, \u201cyou know what Randi, you\u2019re never as good as they say you are, and you\u2019re never as bad as they say you are. You can\u2019t let it get to your head or your heart.\u201d14. What's the worst piece of advice you ever got?Someone once told me to be less interesting. I think they meant it in a constructive way, because in Silicon Valley there is a culture that you have to be 24/7 invested in your startup, otherwise you\u2019re not taken seriously. It\u2019s a very \u201call in\u201d culture, especially if you\u2019re a woman. People already expect you to be distracted by your family, so you need to go even more down that road to show you\u2019re all in.I always loved theater and art, so I got some advice to be less interesting, because they felt like people might think I was distracted if they knew I also had an interest in theater. It took me a few years to realize that was probably the worst piece of advice I had ever been given.\u00a015. What\u2019s a productivity tip you swear by?I swear by Evernote and note-taking apps. I\u2019m constantly writing notes to myself and sharing them with my team and my husband. With email I respond either instantly or never. If I\u2019m sitting there I can respond right away, but if I walk away, I get buried by a hundred more emails that come in. I wouldn\u2019t be able to function without it.Related: This Founder Shares the Secret to How to Make Your Business Last16. Is there an app or tool you use in a surprising way to get things done or stay on track?It\u2019s old school, but I set a lot of alarms during the day, like for when when I want to be done with something. Sometimes I follow them, sometimes I don\u2019t, but it does bring mindfulness into my day.17. What does work-life balance mean to you?To me, it\u2019s a long-term goal. A lot of people put pressure on themselves to make it a short-term, everyday goal. I like to give myself permission to be lopsided on a given day.18. How do you prevent burnout?I have two toddlers, and I\u2019m on the road over 100 days a year for work. It\u2019s really easy to put yourself last. I found that I was always thinking about work and then rushing to be home for my family. So self care was at the bottom of my priority list. If you don\u2019t carve out time for yourself, you\u2019re not going to be good to anyone else in your life.Now I block out those do not schedule chunks. I\u2019m the only one that is going to create those boundaries for myself and my time, not anyone else. I would definitely encourage more entrepreneurs to not feel bad or guilty about doing things like that.19. When you\u2019re faced with a creativity block, what\u2019s your strategy to get innovating?I just try to force myself to sit and write -- even if what I write is nonsense, and I end up throwing it out. Creativity and writing is a muscle, and you need to discipline yourself to actually sit and write ideally at the same time every day to get used to it. Before you know it, if you keep going, you\u2019re going to write something. I was able to write my whole business book in less than a month, because I decided that I was going to write four to six hours every day.20. What are you learning now? For me, I even see social media and technology as constant education. The tech is changing so quickly for someone like me. If I didn\u2019t constantly work to keep educating myself, I wouldn't even be hired as a junior social-media manager today. \u00a0I\u2019m constantly in a state learning, researching what\u2019s going on, what the innovations are, what the social media platforms are doing. There is not day that goes by that I don\u2019t try to educate myself in tech.Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

      "title": "10 Apps and Tools to Make Your Small Business Better and More Efficient",
      "content": "For many startups, achieving meaningful growth -- the kind that gets the attention of investors and potential buyers -- means having the right tools. While larger companies can usually afford to build their own custom solutions, smaller businesses tend to rely on outside vendors. Fortunately, plenty of companies out there cater to the specific needs of smaller enterprises and early-stage startups, and the tools they provide are often as affordable as they are effective.From customer relationship management platforms to project management programs, here are seven of the best and most widely used tools on the market today.

      "title": "6 Tips and Tricks to Get the Most Downloads for Your App",
      "content": "Many startups spend huge amounts of money on advertising, yet neglect app store optimization. App store optimization is the most cost-effective method to organically increase your installs for a couple of reasons:Here are a few\u00a0tips and tricks:\u00a0The title of your app ranks more heavily than the rest of the meta-data, so choose it wisely. Make sure you target words in your title that you want to hit the most, words that you're confident about. Tools like SensorTower\u00a0and AppAnnie can provide you accurate traffic volumes and difficulties of certain keywords. Also, make sure you don\u2019t keyword stuff the title; the app store will reject your app.Related: How Can App Makes Improve Revenue and Keep Users Engaged?Depending on how many downloads and how much traffic your app is already getting, you must adjust your keywords. For example, if your app is already getting high traffic and downloads, you can target more competitive keywords that have higher traffic. If you are just starting up an app that nobody knows about and isn\u2019t getting featured, I recommend choosing keywords that have a low difficulty level and medium traffic (according to analytic tools like SensorTower or AppAnnie). There are likely some keywords that are gems that others are not targeting and may have decent traffic.As every app store is separated geographically by country, it is really wise to localize your app to optimize it for discovery across different languages. The app store allows you to change the meta-data within your app depending on which country is searching for your app. Some companies have used a mixture of Google translate and native speakers to help localize their apps, so it shouldn't be too difficult for you to localize as well. Localization is a huge aspect of having an effective presence globally.

      "title": "How to Train Your Robot: 4 Ways Startups Can Apply AI",
      "content": "Despite nationwide venture funding hitting a multiyear low, venture capital deployed to artificial intelligence startups has reached a record high.Last year, VCs struck 658 deals with AI companies, nearly five times the number that signed on the dotted line four years before. To date, the market contains 2,045 AI startups and more than 17,000 market followers, with more joining by the day.Related: How Artificial Intelligence Startups Struck GoldAI\u2019s rapid rise has swept up startups and enterprises alike, including U.S. automaker Ford, which recently bought AI startup Argo for $1 billion. The acquisition cements experts\u2019 suspicions of Ford\u2019s coming foray into self-driving technology. Other startups -- so many, in fact, that entrepreneurs need a \u201cbest of\u201d guide -- are betting heavily on bot platforms.So while we\u2019ve just glimpsed the tip of this innovation iceberg, it\u2019s clear AI is no longer some nebulous technology of the future. Sixty-eight percent of marketing executives, according to media research firm Weber Shandwick, report using AI in their operations. For a technology that only went mainstream in 2016 and barely existed four years ago, that\u2019s a remarkable adoption rate. How, regardless of the platform you choose, can you join forward-thinking entrepreneurs and build your business with AI? So far, four ways stand out:A politician wouldn\u2019t dream of delivering a small-town stump speech to her urban constituents. Why? Because you\u2019ve got to know your audience. The same is true for entrepreneurs. Before you broadcast your message, you need to know who you\u2019re trying to reach.Node, an account-based intelligence startup, uses natural language processing -- a fancy term for teaching a computer to understand how we humans speak and write -- to develop customer profiles. Node is crunching vast swaths of data to connect the dots between marketers and the companies they\u2019re trying to reach.Once you have ample customer data -- Node uses data crawlers to scrape information from social media, news sites and more -- pair machine learning and natural language processing models to extract sentiments from unstructured data. Then, just as senators segment constituents into demographic groups, Node uses cluster analysis to sort clients\u2019 customers into like cohorts.Related:\u00a0Top 10 Best Chatbot Platform Tools to Build Chatbots for Your BusinessIf, heaven forbid, you forgot to tag your neighbor at last week\u2019s house party, Facebook was no doubt there to remind you of your error. How does Facebook know which of your friends you left untagged? It has gone all-in on an AI technique called convolutional neural networks.Convolutional neural networks, which loosely model how the brain\u2019s visual cortex interacts with the eyes, work by separating an image into tiny portions before running each of those specks through a multilayered filter. It then \u201csees\u201d where each speck overlaps with other parts of the image, and through automated iterations, it puts together a full image.Many different ways exist to apply this technology, but retail businesses can start with image classification. Try using a convolutional neural network to break down photos of your products posted online. The model can identify customer segments that frequently use your product, where they\u2019re using it and whether they commonly pair other products with yours. Essentially, this automated image analysis can show you how your products fit into customers\u2019 lives, allowing you to tailor your marketing materials to fit.Related:\u00a04 AI Technologies Impacting Business Operations Right NowSuccess on social media requires careful listening and quick action. When a social campaign isn\u2019t working, it\u2019s best to put it out of its misery quickly. On the other hand, when one strikes a chord with customers, doubling down pays dividends.But to do so, you need real-time insights about customers\u2019 reactions to your content. Fortunately, AI can take the emotional temperature of thousands of customers at once. Dumbstruck, a video-testing and analytics startup that I advise, has added natural language processing to its emotional analytics stack. This allows it to provide moment-by-moment insights into viewers\u2019 reactions to media. Dumbstruck\u2019s model grows stronger with each reaction analyzed, producing a program that perceives human emotions even better than some people can.Customer service is -- or should be, according to consumers -- the department that never sleeps. More than half of people, 50.6 percent to be precise, believe a business should be available 24/7 to answer their every question and concern. When asked whether businesses should be available via a messaging app, the \u201cyes\u201d votes jump to nearly two in three.Fortunately, bots don\u2019t sleep, eat or go off-script. A well-built bot can offer cost-effective, constant customer service. Of course, grooming your bot to serve customers requires front-end data -- ideally hundreds of thousands of example conversations -- but you can get started with a human-chatbot hybrid. With this approach, the bot answers run-of-the-mill questions, while a human takes over for the more complex ones. Then, as the data builds and the model matures, you can phase in full automation.Related: The New Reality: AI-Enhanced RelationshipsTaco Bell, for example, knows taco cravings come at all times of night. Its TacoBot takes customer orders via Slack chat. Ticketmaster, a popular concert ticket provider, also offers an automated chat widget that informs users about new events and provides order details.Artificial intelligence is not just the stuff of Netflix shows and sci-fi paperbacks.

      "title": "How This Female Inventor Succeeded in Male-Dominated Industries",
      "content": "While companies such as\u00a0Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Samsung and HTC have invested billions of dollars into virtual reality, startup castAR co-founder Jeri Ellsworth sees an augmented reality future. Anyone who\u2019s played the 2016 hit mobile game Pokemon Go has had a taste of augmented reality, which blends virtual characters with the real world.Serial inventor and entrepreneur Ellsworth worked at Valve Software, helping to found and grow the hardware department. The hardware department teams went on to release other products including the HTC Vive and the Steam Box controller, while she\u00a0focused more on augmented reality. \u00a0Related:\u00a0 10 Amazing Uses of\u00a0Virtual RealityThat augmented reality platform allowed players to wear specially-designed glasses and use a wand to interact with holographic creations that came to life on a flat surface like a tabletop, much like a real-world version of the HoloChess concept introduced in the original Star Wars back in 1977.In 2013, Ellsworth decided to leave, and since Valve was focused on virtual reality, she asked Valve president and owner Gabe Newell if she and colleague/programmer Rick Johnson could take that still-early prototype technology with them. He agreed, and castAR was born.\u201cWhat I learned from working at Valve and some of the amazing people there was that the company is hyper-focused on the customer experience,\u201d Ellsworth said. \u201cAlmost every decision that\u2019s made is studied under the microscope of how it impacts the end-user experience.\u201dEllsworth has a solid track record of succeeding across multiple male-dominated industries. She dropped out of high school in her small hometown of Dallas, Ore.,\u00a0and decided to build and race cars -- with no experience.\u201cI\u2019ve always been an inventor and tinkerer since I was a kid,\u201d Ellsworth recalled. \u201cI was always dismantling everything in our home and making something different of things. My father was perpetually frustrated that any device he brought into the house was going to be dismantled.\u201dEllsworth has spent her career learning from mentors and putting in the work. She found a local machinist in Oregon to teach her how to weld in exchange for her cleaning up the shop. She spent six years designing, building, racing and selling custom racecars. She also spent time dirt track racing with her father and competed in the I5 Challenge.Related:\u00a07 Reasons You Need a\u00a0Mentor\u00a0for Entrepreneurial SuccessShe went from designing racecars to customizing PCs in the \u201890s, running her own retail store called Computers Made Easy.\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to run a\u00a0retail business or coordinate teams, but when I opened up my first store I had an insurance guy who came over at lunch and taught me how to run a business and work with employees and keep customers happy,\u201d Ellsworth said.Once the profit margins dropped for custom PCs, Ellsworth headed to Silicon Valley and began building semiconductors and tackling system-level engineering challenges at companies like Intersil, Ubicom, Rapport, and Zenverge. She designed complicated toys in the early 2000s like the all-in-one video game joystick C64 Direct-to-TV, which put her on the radar of the video game industry. It was ultimately her in-depth weekly science educational webcast with George Sanger, Fatman and Circuit Girl, which dove into tough engineering problems, that attracted Newell\u2019s attention.Ellsworth\u2019s success in every industry she\u2019s tackled has drawn the attention of very successful entrepreneurs.\u201cComing to Silicon Valley without a traditional education, it was mind-blowing the type of mentors I was able to learn from,\u201d Ellsworth said. \u201cSteve Wozniak and Lee Felstenstein took time to give me advice.\u201dRelated:\u00a0How\u00a0Augmented Reality\u00a0Will Shape the Future of EcommerceOne of those mentors along her journey was Andy Rubin, who she first met at Danger Inc. When Ellsworth was looking to evolve castAR from a successful million dollar Kickstarter campaign into a mainstream business, she heard Rubin was doing a venture fund incubator program for startups, Playground Global. So she sent him an email, and eventually (following a successful tour of the Silicon Valley VC circuit) he replied, and invested.\u201cA few weeks into working with Andy and his team, he told us the key to creating a successful product is to leverage the talent of the developers out there,\u201d Ellsworth explained. \u201cIf there\u2019s something that\u2019s difficult for them to do, focus on making a tool to make it easier. That same lesson applies to making things easy for the end-user.\u201dEllsworth said Rubin will randomly drop by the office in Palo Alto and help the team stretch its thinking.\u201cHe\u2019ll spend a lot of time talking about where I want to go with the company two or three chess moves out,\u201d Ellsworth said.That blueprint is to launch a rock solid augmented reality experience this fall that anyone, including her father, can reach into and mold virtual clay or play a driving game with the grandkids plowing a tractor through virtual corn fields. By the third generation of the platform, Ellsworth wants to lift the experience off the table and allow them to watch movies in the kitchen on a virtual screen or cook with a virtual recipe book next to the smart stove or use the smart thermostat to see how energy consumption has been over the last month. Within 10 years, the goal is to start to replace today\u2019s smartphones and tablets and some general computing with augmented reality\u00a0and start to use AR for navigation.\u201cAndy helps you draw a line through all of these things we want to do and how to take the customer on this journey with you,\u201d Ellsworth said. \u201cWe talk about creating graphics on glasses and how we can train them up so by the time they\u2019re off the table and moving around they\u2019re already familiar with and comfortable with the technology.\u201dEllsworth also learned the lesson of moving the company forward, even if it means taking a loss to satisfy the past. After the successful Kickstarter campaign, castAR engineers were torn between building and shipping the older version of the platform, which connected to a home PC, and the newer (and final) retail project, which doesn\u2019t require a PC. Rubin and his team sat Ellsworth down and asked what she wanted to do. And she said she wanted castAR customers to wander around the world tetherless and enjoy these experiences.\u201cAndy told us to refund the Kickstarter backers\u2019 money and focus on the future,\u201d Ellsworth said. \u201cWe decided to give back their money and give them a free pair of the fully-integrated glasses when they\u2019re ready. Our CFO had a hard time with us giving away hundreds of thousands of dollars in free AR glasses, but the marketing guys said this was great for marketing the technology.\u201dWhile introducing brand new technology to consumers will be a challenge, it\u2019s just another hurdle for Ellsworth to navigate. And she has plenty of experience, and great mentors, to help her on this journey.John Gaudiosi is the Editorial Director at Shacknews.com.",

      "content": "After years of experimenting with 3D-printed footwear, Adidas on Friday announced that its first mass-produced 3D-printed shoe, the Futurecraft 4D, will go on sale this fall.The shoe's sole is shaped using digital light projection, a technology you might be familiar with if you shopped for a rear-projection TV 20 years ago. Despite rear-projection's demise, the technique is still alive in the\u00a03D printing\u00a0industry: it projects patterned light onto a liquid photopolymer resin, shaping and hardening it into layers.To make the Futurecraft 4D's sole, Adidas partnered with the Silicon Valley startup Carbon, which\u00a0says\u00a0that its digital light synthesis technique is more efficient than ordinary 3D printing, and thus better-suited to making large quantities of durable goods. According to\u00a0Texas Instruments, which originally developed the digital light processing concept in the 1980s, it's now used to quickly print everything from prototypes, jewelry casting, custom medical implants\u00a0and complex automotive and aerospace components.In Adidas's case, digital light synthesis results in a sole that works just as well as one made in an injection mold and has similar costs and production times. The company plans to sell 5,000 of the Futurecraft 4D this fall, and an additional 10,000 next year. Pricing hasn't been announced yet; Reuters\u00a0reports\u00a0that the shoes will sell at an \"unspecified premium price,\" but Adidas plans to lower the cost as the technology develops.Despite the benefits that 3D printing promises to bring to shoe design and manufacturing, it has been a gradual development process for Adidas and its competitors, at least compared to the consumer tech lifecycle. In 2013, New Balance became the first athletic brand to have a track athlete -- middle distance runner Jack Bolas -- compete in 3D-printed spike plates. But it wasn't until three years later that the company managed to\u00a0sell a 3D-printed shoe\u00a0to the public in the form of a limited-edition $400 sneaker.Adidas, meanwhile, unveiled the Futurecraft 4D's predecessor as a\u00a0concept shoe\u00a0in 2015. It used thermoplastic polyurethane instead of resin shaped by digital light projection.Tom is PCMag's San Francisco-based news reporter.\u00a0",

      "title": "3 Reasons Why IT Security Must Be a Top Concern for Tech Startups",
      "content": "Web and mobile apps are now a dime a dozen as more ventures join the rush to roll\u00a0out the next killer app. According to AppBrain, there are nearly\u00a02.8 million apps\u00a0on the Android market to date. Search for a particular interest or functionality and there is likely a dozen or so web and mobile apps that would pop up. The volume and pace of app creation lead to a sizable percentage of poorly developed apps that almost\u00a0a quarter of users\u00a0abandon them after first use.What is worse, these bad apps can leave users exposed. A\u00a0study\u00a0by Codified Security found that 40 percent of published apps leave vulnerable backdoors that can be exploited by attackers. These vulnerabilities can leave user data exposed or allow malicious actors to gain access to computers and servers used in testing and development.Related: How Do Google, Apple and Others Stack Up When It Comes to Protecting Your Privacy?The competitive nature of the industry demands ventures to ship software quickly.\u00a0However, shoddy coding and careless testing can leave the venture and its users exposed to cyberattack risks with potentially disastrous ends. The issue becomes even more pressing as new technology trends such as the wider adoption of financial technology and internet of things (IoT) devices is set to bring forth a new wave of apps and services.Security must be at the center of all tech startup activities.2016 had no shortage of high profile cyberattacks that involved large tech companies, internet infrastructure providers, banks\u00a0and government institutions. But, for every big name company, there were numerous other smaller organizations that also\u00a0suffered attacks. Among the top threats that persist today are ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS)\u00a0and data breaches.\u00a0Ransomware are consistently identified by security firms such as Kaspersky as\u00a0top threats\u00a0to organizations. Ransomware are malware that encrypt a computer or network\u2019s files. Attackers then demand ransom from victims in exchange for a chance of getting their files back.\u00a0DDoS attacks seek to deny access to a website or service by overwhelming its server with traffic. The biggest DDoS attack on record happened last year when DNS provider Dyn was hit. The outage also affected popular sites and apps that were under Dyn\u2019s network such as Netflix, Spotify and The New York Times.\u00a0Among these attacks, data breaches pose the real threat to end users. Stolen confidential information are commonly shopped around to criminal entities in the dark web. Data containing personal, financial\u00a0or proprietary information can return a profit when sold in the black market. Sites and apps that store customer information are prime targets for such attacks.Related: We Scored High on This Cybersecurity Quiz. How About You?Any form of downtime or disruption is costly for any business. Network security solution Incapsula estimates the cost of downtime caused by DDoS attacks to an ecommerce site to average\u00a0$40,000 per hour. Other attackers also perform DDoS attacks for ransom knowing that companies may be willing to pay in order to avoid the costs of downtime.An IBM and Ponemon Institute study says that each stolen record costs the company\u00a0$158 each\u00a0in damages. Getting hit by a data breach can heavily impact a company\u2019s valuation as well. The sale price of Yahoo! has dwindled since its disclosure of past massive data breaches. Verizon asked for a $3$350 million\u00a0discount\u00a0after the data breaches were publicized.As for ransomware, while attackers may only ask for\u00a0$722 on average, getting locked out critical files can be catastrophic for organizations that do not have backup systems in place. There is no assurance access will be restored even if the ransom gets paid.\u00a0Beyond the outright financial impact, businesses also risk loss of customer trust and reputation when hit by cyberattacks. For a startup, such fallout can sink the whole venture before it even gets off the ground.Related: The Worst Hacks of 2017 -- So FarBusinesses get exposed due to a variety of reasons. Non-tech startups are especially vulnerable. Often without dedicated personnel to oversee the proper use of IT resources, it is common for computers and networks to be left unsecure. Lack of training on fundamental IT security practices also leave staff vulnerable to social engineering attacks such as phishing which in turn pave the way for more serious attacks.Tech companies should know better. If they intend to market themselves as experts with superior products, they should be making security a critical part of their work. A good portion of tech startups effort is involved in product development so ensuring that their software is secure is vital.Mirai, the malware responsible for a number of massive DDoS attacks last year, exploits unsecure IoT devices and use them to carry out attacks. Many of these devices, which include IP cameras and network devices, were poorly designed and lacked security features that could have prevented Mirai infections. Leaving out security in the product design and making product development shortcuts can have serious consequences.The Codified Security also revealed that the app vulnerabilities are often due to careless coding. Developers may leave out information in their published code such as server credentials. As some apps use the same server instances when they go live, access to those servers can ultimately compromise all server data which, by that time, may already include customer information.Related: 4 Easy Ways to Protect Your Company From a CyberattackSo how can tech startups mitigate these risks?For developers, security should be a fundamental consideration in the software design. Code should be vigilantly reviewed in order to track vulnerabilities which can be exploited. It is critical to subject all software to intensive QA. Testing and should not be skipped in favor of accelerating shipping or launch dates.\u00a0Organizations should perform security audits to identify vulnerabilities in their operations. Educating staff regarding the best practices ensure that IT resources are used in a secure manner and that no company or customer data get compromised. Tech ventures should also be implementing security measures to cover other business activities especially those that involve customer data such as sales and marketing.Customer information should be held in the strictest confidence. Startups owe it to their customers to safeguard the privacy and security of those who entrusted the company with their business.Ralph Tkatchuk is a data security consultant and and an IT guy with 15 years of field experience working with clients of various sizes and verticals.

Inside the tube, pods filled with passengers and cargo will magnetically levitate and accelerate via electric propulsion to speeds approaching those of a commercial airliner. Such high speeds are attainable because of the tube's low atmospheric pressure, which contributes to reduced aerodynamic drag.The company plans to have a team of 500 engineers, fabricators, scientists\u00a0and other employees working on its technology by the end of the year. That's a big increase from last year, when the company had fewer than 100 engineers, many of them ex-NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory employees based at the company's headquarters in California.Last May, those engineers\u00a0demonstrated\u00a0their propulsion technology in front of hundreds of journalists. A small white sled accelerated to more than 100 miles an hour over a straight track of a few hundred meters, and the entire test lasted less than five seconds. One of the ex-JPL engineers, Cassandra Mercury, said at the time that the company was looking forward to testing the completed design.\"We're going to have it levitating, in a tube, with a pod, at vacuum,\" she told PCMag. \"That's why they're calling it the Kitty Hawk moment.\" With the tube now completed, those tests can begin, although the company did not offer a timeframe.In addition to overcoming technological hurdles, the company has also faced legal ones: co-founder and CTO Brogan BamBrogan, along with other former employees,\u00a0sued\u00a0the company last summer for wrongful termination, alleging, among other things, that they were forced out for speaking to investors about cultural issues within the futuristic firm.Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Wednesday that the technology will \"transform transportation as we know it.\" He is currently promoting the hyperloop as a feasible alternative to driving or flying between cities in the same region, such as Los Angeles to San Diego, Miami to Orlando and Seattle to Portland.Tom is PCMag's San Francisco-based news reporter.\u00a0",

If you\u2019re looking to leverage a bigger platform to skyrocket the growth of your startup, here are three reasons to do so:Most startups face the problem of having little-to-no customers when they first start out. This is normal. However, when you utilize a platform like Fiverr, you suddenly have access to whoever uses their platform. Whether those users are vendors or customers not directly looking for your product, you still get the benefits of having an influx of eyeballs on your product or service.Once you\u2019ve grown to a solid base of customers, you can then re-invest a good chunk of that revenue in advertising for acquiring more customers. Fiverr is a big enough platform that gives you access to millions of business owners around the world.However, you shouldn\u2019t be limited to what a platform provides. Pros uses Fiverr as a pre-qualifier\u00a0to acquire bigger clients who can afford his agency's high-end services.Since he often starts working with these clients on Fiverr, it\u2019s easier for him to close high-end deals.

      "content": "In 2015, algorithm developer\u00a0and facial-recognition technology expert\u00a0NTechLab\u00a0was founded. In the company's first year, it bested\u00a0Google at facial recognition in the University of Washington\u2019s MegaFace Challenge.How did a young upstart insert itself into a developing industry and steal a coveted prize from a big player? And what can tech entrepreneurs learn from NTechLab's success?It\u2019s easy for entrepreneurs to get distracted. It's essential to know about the latest developments in your industry and keep tabs on your competition. But if you find that search for information steals focus from your key ideas, it\u2019s time to put on the blinders.\u00a0\u201cThink about what you\u2019re really interested in as early as possible, without diverting to anything else,\" NTechLab founder Artem Kuharenko says. \"If you have interesting ideas, you should do your best to bring them to the real, working-demo version, which you can show friends and potential investors.\u201dRelated: Getting Clarity on Your Big-Picture VisionMuch of NTechLab\u2019s success is due to its closely-knit team of computer scientists who maintain an unwavering focus on becoming the best at what they do. By narrowing its machine-learning algorithm developments to facial recognition, NTechLab was able to beat Google at a game the giant practically invented. \u00a0Not only that, NTechLab set itself apart from competitors by creating a product whose algorithm can be applied to real-life industries. Kuharenko explains that narrowing the parameters pushed his company to \"make the algorithm very accurate and quick at searching through large photo databases -- billions of them.\u201dRelated: This Is the Year of the Machine-Learning RevolutionAnother of NTechLab's core strategies involves aligning itself with well-known names. Think\u00a0you can\u2019t compete on a level playing field with the biggest tech companies? Think again. Oftentimes a smaller competitor with a laser focus is more successful than a large company with unlimited resources but far less specification.When NTechLab won a highly publicized prize in facial-recognition technology, the company leveraged organic public relations to make its name known. In the process, NTechLab became associated with major industry players -- the largest in the world. When your company name is used in the same sentence as the best and biggest in your field, you know you\u2019re doing something right.Related: What Small Businesses Can Learn About Creating a Lasting Brand From Apple, Dunkin' Donuts and CVSWhen you consider your technology's utility, make sure you remain open to all its possibilities. The artificial intelligence you're developing for biotech or medicine might eventually apply to a broader range of industry verticals.\u201cWe try to look at the wider range of markets,\" Kuharenko says. \"We\u2019re not only developers of one of the world\u2019s best facial-recognition technologies but can also create products using our vast experience in wider areas.\u201dRelated: 4 Ways Technology Is Changing the Events IndustryFacial-recognition technology presents many opportunities. As it becomes more widely known, a greater number of industries will become open to adopting these advances. A technology that started as a way to improve\u00a0airport and homeland security now is spreading to retail, advertising, online dating and a host of other markets.

      "content": "The\u00a0digital wallet revolution\u00a0has\u00a0not have lived up to its expectations -- yet. According to Gallup, just\u00a013 percent of smartphone owners have a digital wallet app, while the majority of those who do have an app (76 percent), rarely use it.That may be disheartening for those of us involved in the industry, but there\u2019s always a silver lining.Business Insider\u00a0is forecasting that in the U.S. alone mobile payments volume will increase to $503 billion by 2020 and will be used by 56 percent\u00a0of the consumer population during that year. Meanwhile,\u00a0Sweden, Singapore, the Netherlands, France, Canada, Belgium\u00a0and the U.K. are already on their way to becoming cashless societies - with Australia, Brazil, India and much of Africa following suit.Related:\u00a0How Digital is India Towards a\u00a0Cashless\u00a0Future?While there are still barriers and limitations, such as security concerns and limited number of compatible vendors, digital wallets, and mobile payments are not only changing how we pay for goods and services, they also have the power to go beyond payments because of how they\u2019re constantly being evolved - which is going to be important for both businesses and customers.The idea of a digital wallet, which is basically just a digital version of a physical wallet, isn\u2019t new. In fact, David Chaum, an American cryptographer, created digital cash all the way back in 1983. That was\u00a0the beginning of cryptocurrencies.Once we entered the '90s, however, things began to accelerate rather quickly. Thanks to the internet and advances in technology, we had the ability to start ordering pizzas online (some claim that happened in 1994 when a customer ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza from Pizza Hut) and purchase movie tickets using a phone (Ericsson and\u00a0Telenor\u00a0Mobil accomplished this in 1999). We also saw the introduction of PayPal in 1998, which is considered the first digital wallet.By 2003, mobile devices started\u00a0picking up\u00a0momentum, which was followed by developments like the invention of bitcoin in 2008 and the introduction of Google Wallet (2011) and Apple Pay (2014).Related:\u00a0Looking for a New Payment Company? You're 'Due' for Some Good News.Today, however, there\u2019s a lot of confusion surrounding digital wallets and mobile payments since these terms are interchanged so frequently. To be clear, a\u00a0digital wallet\u00a0is simply tokenization of data. While digital wallets are often associated with payments, they can be used to issue digital rewards, tickets or boarding passes, room keys, or identification.Mobile wallets are basically the mobile version of a digital wallet with\u00a0five types of mobile payments:Related:\u00a04 Things You Should Know About\u00a0Cashless PaymentsFor customers, digital wallets and mobile payments can replace carrying around a bulky wallet. Besides being a minor hassle, you no longer have to be concerned if you forgot your cash, credit card, or ID at home. All that information is stored\u00a0on\u00a0your smartphone. And, unlike your wallet, you probably never leave home without your phone.Additionally, using digital and mobile payments saves you time. Instead of inserting a card into an EMV terminal, you can just swipe and go. And, when shopping online, you no longer have to\u00a0race\u00a0against time to complete a purchase before your session expires, like when buying concert tickets. As long as you have a digital wallet, you can make instantaneous payments online.Digital wallets also come with customer perks like promotions, cash back rewards, and keeping track of your accounting easier. Most importantly, they\u2019re convenient. You can split a dinner tab with friends, pay bills, and avoid expensive transaction fees when you\u00a0travel.For businesses\u00a0you have access to funds almost immediately, you save money on transaction fees by removing third parties, and you don\u2019t have to invest in an expensive POS system. Additionally, digital and mobile payments provide access to real-time data, helps you maintain a competitive edge, and most importantly, improves the customer experience since you\u2019re providing fast and secure payment methods.Related:\u00a0Uber Reinvents Its Payment Model, Introduces\u00a0Digital WalletsDigital wallets and mobile payments are rapidly evolving\u00a0in order to enhance the experience for both customers and business owners. That means that they\u2019re going beyond simply transferring funds electronically or swiping your smartphone over a checkout terminal.For example, major banking institutions that JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and U.S. Bancorp, launched a joint venture called clearXchange. This allows customers to transfer funds instantly to another bank account through their phones. Traditional banks are also creating digital wallet apps that allow you to review your account, establish budgets, receive alert notifications, and transfer fund via social channels like Facebook.Related: Surging Ahead: Fintech Startups In The Middle EastWearables, such as watches, wristbands, and jackets, are starting to be used to make payments, as is the possibility of tapping into the Internet of Things.

There are, however, several advances in both medical technology and personal health that some innovative startups are using to help solve those problems. \u00a0Dave Willis, Chief Strategy Officer for Clarius Mobile Health, a provider of mobile ultrasound units, explains how entrepreneurs and healthcare startups can help solve this problem.\u00a0\u201cIn the past, the challenging logistics and exorbitant cost made it difficult for hospitals to purchase multiple ultrasound machines. The medical device industry responded to those pain points by creating mobile versions that are truly detailed and accurate, enabling practitioners to use the technology easier and more effectively.\u201dOther innovators like Sensodx and RHealth have created mobile health devices that require little more than a drop of blood to help speed up the diagnoses of various diseases.Related:\u00a0<!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->How an Endurance Coach Helped Change Running ShoesThe reason mobile healthcare technologies are so revolutionary is because they are easier to deploy and they make critical health care evaluations more affordable.

      "title": "Can Artificial Intelligence Identify Pictures Better than Humans?",
      "content": "Computer-based artificial intelligence (AI) has been around since the 1940s, but the current innovation boom around everything from virtual personal assistants and visual search engines to real-time translation and driverless cars has led to new milestones in the field. And ever since IBM\u2019s Deep Blue beat Russian chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, machine versus human milestones inevitably bring up the question of whether or not AI can do things better than humans (it\u2019s the the inevitable fear around Ray Kurzweil\u2019s singularity).As image recognition experiments have shown, computers can easily and accurately identify hundreds of breeds of cats and dogs faster and more accurately than humans, but does that mean that machines are better than us at recognizing what\u2019s in a picture? As with most comparisons of this sort, at least for now, the answer is little bit yes and plenty of no.Less than a decade ago, image recognition was a relatively sleepy subset of computer vision and AI, found mostly in photo organization apps, search engines and assembly line inspection. It ran on a mix of keywords attached to pictures and engineer-programmed algorithms. As far as the average user was concerned, it worked as advertised: Searching for donuts under \u201cImages\u201d in Google delivered page after page of doughy pastry-filled pictures. \u00a0But getting those results was enabled only by laborious human intervention in the form of manually inputting said identifying keyword tags for each and every picture and feeding a definition of the properties of said donut into an algorithm. It wasn\u2019t something that could easily scale.More recently, however, advances using an AI training technology known as deep learning are making it possible for computers to find, analyze\u00a0and categorize images without the need for additional human programming. Loosely based on human brain processes, deep learning implements large artificial neural networks --\u00a0hierarchical layers of interconnected nodes -- that rearrange themselves as new information comes in, enabling computers to literally teach themselves. \u00a0As with human brains, artificial neural networks enable computers to get smarter the more data they process. And, when you\u2019re running these deep learning techniques on supercomputers such as Baidu\u2019s Minwa, which has 72 processors and 144 graphics processors (GPUs), you can input a phenomenal amount of data. Considering that more than three billion images are shared across the internet every day --\u00a0Google Photos alone saw uploads of 50 billion photos in its first four months of existence --\u00a0it\u2019s safe to say that the amount of data available for training these days is phenomenal. So, is all this computing power and data making machines better than humans at image recognition?There\u2019s no doubt that recent advances in computer vision have been impressive . . .\u00a0and rapid. As recently as 2011, humans beat computers by a wide margin when identifying images, in a test featuring approximately 50,000 images that needed to be categorized into one of 10 categories (\u201cdogs,\u201d \u201ctrucks\u201d and\u00a0others). Researchers at Stanford University developed software to take the test: It was correct about 80 percent of the time, whereas the human opponent, Stanford PhD candidate and researcher Andrej Karpathy, scored 94 percent.Then, in 2012, a team at the Google X research lab approached the task a different way, by feeding 10 million randomly selected thumbnail images from YouTube videos into an artificial neural network with more than 1 billion connections spread over 16,000 CPUs. After this three-day training period was over, the researchers gave the machine 20,000 randomly selected images with no identifying information. The computer looked for the most recurring images and accurately identified ones that contained faces 81.7 percent of the time, human body parts 76.7 percent of the time, and cats 74.8 percent of the time.At the 2014 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2014, Google came in first place with a convolutional neural network approach that resulted in just a 6.6 percent error rate, almost half the previous year\u2019s rate of 11.7 percent. The accomplishment was not simply correctly identifying images containing dogs, but correctly identifying around 200 different dog breeds in images, something that only the most computer-savvy canine experts might be able to accomplish in a speedy fashion. Once again, Karpathy, a dedicated human labeler who trained on 500 images and identified 1,500 images, beat the computer with a 5.1 percent error rate.This record lasted until February 2015, when Microsoft announced it had beat the human record with a 4.94 percent error rate. And then just a few months later, in December, Microsoft beat its own record with a 3.5 percent classification error rate at the most recent ImageNet challenge.Deep learning algorithms are helping computers beat humans in other visual formats. Last year, a team of researchers at Queen Mary University London developed a program called Sketch-a-Net, which identifies objects in sketches. The program correctly identified 74.9 percent of the sketches it analyzed, while the humans participating in the study only correctly identified objects in sketches 73.1 percent of the time. Not that impressive, but as in the previous example with dog breeds, the computer was able to correctly identify which type of bird was drawn in the sketch 42.5 percent of the time, an accuracy rate nearly twice that of the people in the study, with 24.8 percent.These numbers are impressive, but they don\u2019t tell the whole story. \u201cEven the smartest machines are still blind,\u201d said computer vision expert Fei-Fei Li at a 2015 TED Talk on image recognition. Yes, convolutional neural networks and deep learning have helped improve accuracy rates in computer vision \u2013 they\u2019ve even enabled machines to write surprisingly accurate captions to images -- but machines still stumble in plenty of situations, especially when more context, backstory, or proportional relationships are required. Computers struggle when, say, only part of an object is in the picture \u2013 a scenario known as occlusion \u2013 and may have trouble telling the difference between an elephant\u2019s head and trunk and a teapot. Similarly, they stumble when distinguishing between a statue of a man on a horse and a real man on a horse, or mistake a toothbrush being held by a baby for a baseball bat. And let\u2019s not forget, we\u2019re just talking about identification of basic everyday objects \u2013 cats, dogs, and so on -- in images.Computers still aren\u2019t able to identify some seemingly simple (to humans) pictures such as this picture of yellow and black stripes, which computers seem to think is a school bus. This technology is, unsurprisingly, still in its infant stage. After all, it took the human brain 540 million years to evolve into its highly capable current form.What computers are better at is sorting through vast amounts of data and processing it quickly, which comes in handy when, say, a radiologist needs to narrow down a list of x-rays with potential medical maladies or a marketer wants to find all the images relevant to his brand on social media. The things a computer is identifying may still be basic --\u00a0a cavity, a logo --\u00a0but it\u2019s identifying it from a much larger pool of pictures and it\u2019s doing it quickly without getting bored as a human might.Humans still get nuance better, and can probably tell you more a given picture\u00a0due to basic common sense. For everyday tasks, humans still have significantly better visual capabilities than computers.That said, the promise of image recognition and computer vision at large is massive, especially when seen as part of the larger AI pie. Computers may not have common sense, but they do have direct access to real-time big data, sensors, GPS, cameras\u00a0and the internet\u00a0to name just a few technologies. From robot disaster relief and large-object avoidance in cars to high-tech criminal investigations and augmented reality (AR) gaming\u00a0leaps and bounds beyond Pokemon GO, computer vision\u2019s future may well lie in things that humans simply can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) do. One thing we can be certain of is this: It won\u2019t take 540 million years to get there.Ophir Tanz\u00a0is an entrepreneur, technologist and the CEO and founder of GumGum, a digital-marketing platform for the visual web.
