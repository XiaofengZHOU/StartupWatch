    "content": "BigStock Photo.\nEver feel like there's just too much information out there?New York-based Agolo is hoping so. The startup is developing a program that summarizes large amounts of information using artificial intelligence -- and it's one of two AI startups that announced new funding Wednesday from Microsoft's corporate investment arm, Microsoft Ventures.Agolo's funding, first reported by VentureBeat, was a $3.5 million seed round co-led by Microsoft Ventures and Bay Area firm CRV.The second Microsoft Ventures investment is Berkeley, Calif.-based Bonsai, which develops an AI platform that helps companies build their own intelligent enterprise tools. Bonsai announced a $7.6 million round of funding Wednesday co-led by Microsoft Ventures and Maryland-based firm NEA.While the timing of the investments is a coincidence, they do point to Microsoft's dedication to artificial intelligence technology. The company has a robust internal AI R&D program, and Microsoft Ventures started a fund dedicated in \"AI companies focused on inclusive growth and positive impact on society\" in December of last year.\"It's still early days for our AI fund, but with a plethora of amazing startups out there, I'm confident in our ability to find and support more startups that are responsibly harnessing the power and promise of AI,\" Nagraj Kashyap, corporate vice president at Microsoft Ventures, wrote in a blog post announcing the funding.\"By investing in startups like Agolo and Bonsai, Microsoft Ventures is supporting Microsoft's commitment to democratizing AI and empowering people and businesses for years to come,\" he said.Bonsai's platform has been used to automate systems including robotics, manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, energy and utilities. The company also announced a new Early Access Program on Wednesday, designed to help companies introduce enterprise AI systems.Agolo's tech uses artificial intelligence in a very different way. The startup's platform uses natural language processing to \"read\" texts selected by a user. The algorithm then makes connections between the texts and \"writes\" a summary of the information.Agolo co-founder and CEO Sage Wohns told VentureBeat that the company is already partnering with some of the world's biggest media companies.\"There's a crucial need for making sense of the world's information and Agolo is filling that void. Our platform partnerships with our investors have helped us become indispensable to media companies -- it's hard to find a media company we don't work with. And there are broader applications in diverse sectors, including financial services,\" he said.The company isn't alone in its quest to turn creative processes over to AI. North Carolina-based Automated Insights is working to write \"human sounding\" articles from pure data, for example.And Microsoft is in good company in Seattle's AI world -- last year, Apple acquired Seattle-based machine learning startup Turi, and has opened an AI-focused engineering center in the city. Research at the University of Washington and the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence is also driving Seattle's AI scene, with spin-outs like Kitt.ai starting to build an AI startup ecosystem.",

    "content": "Chris Neumann, general partner, 500 Startups\nIt's really hard to take a deep technology idea and nurture that idea until it grows into a real business, especially with the pressures of modern tech venture capital. 500 Startups thinks it can make that process a little easier.Starting this July, 500 Startups will launch a data-startup oriented track for startups working on big data and machine learning problems. Chris Neumann, who had been advising 500 Startups on this topic since January as entrepreneur-in-residence, is now joining the incubator as a venture partner and will lead the track.\"The current model doesn't work for enterprise data companies,\" said Neumann, who founded DataHero and sold it to Portland-based Cloudability last year. \"Maybe it takes longer than 18 months to build your MVP (minimum viable product), and once you layer on top of that enterprise sales cycles, it turns into something very different\" than experienced by the consumer-facing social media apps so popular among incubators and venture capitalists over the last few years.Also, founders of deep technology companies tend to be, well, immersed in deep technology problems and less aware of what it takes to turn a product demo into a customer pilot and eventually a sales commitment, Neumann said. VCs won't fund small companies until they've demonstrated at least some traction, and first-time founders with great tech ideas often need help getting the business part off the ground.500 Startups will bring in several advisers to help startups in this track, and applications can be submitted here.Editor's Note:This post was updated with Neumann's correct title.",

    "content": "A patient using Ventec Life System's portable ventilation system, VOCSN. (Ventec Life Systems Photo)\nImagine for a moment that your spouse, parent or child has been diagnosed with a life-changing condition. They need constant support from a ventilator to breathe.Traditionally, that means they would need to be attached to a bulky machine, possibly stuck in a hospital bed. And if they were able to return home with a portable ventilator, they would need constant care and assistance.That was Doug DeVries' experience when his father was diagnosed with ALS eight years ago. But DeVries has something not everyone in that situation would: a long career developing ventilation technology. So he set out on a mission to make a better portable ventilator system that would be easier for caregivers to use.DeVries founded Ventec Life Systems four years ago to make the tech he had been working on a reality. His system, called VOCSN, was just approved by the FDA and now the startup has raised a $7 million round to bring it to market, bringing their total funding to date to $28 million.A Ventec spokesperson said all the company's funds so far have been raised from family and friends, many with backgrounds in respiratory care.\"I've seen firsthand how improved ventilator technology can enhance the quality of life for patients and caregivers. Our team didn't want to create just another ventilator, we spent the past five years focused on building a truly integrated solution,\" DeVries said in a news release.The VOCSN system combines ventilation, oxygen, cough, suction and nebulization (medication delivery) services in one device, and allows a user to switch between services using the exact same hardware. That means a patient using a ventilator doesn't have to switch to a different machine to clear their lungs of fluid or take breathable medication.Ventec says the system's combined technologies make it easier to use than alternatives. It also reduces the risk of complications, like infection, that arise from constantly switching devices.A spokesperson for the startup said the goal of the tech is not just to improve patients' quality of life but also to help caregivers, like a child or spouse, spend more time with the patient instead of constantly attending to a ventilator.Ventec will now work with its partners to start a slow roll-out of the device, with the first systems shipping in the U.S. in June.The startup is based in Bothell, Wash., where it carries out all stages of design and manufacturing. It currently has 35 employees.",

    "title": "Startup Spotlight: This biotech company uses fermentation to produce custom compounds",
    "content": "Arzeda combines cloud computing and bioengineering to create 'cell factories.' (Arzeda Photo)\nHere's a wacky concept. Imagine you could give a microorganism, like yeast, specific instructions on what to produce during fermentation.Through the same process used to make beer or sourdough bread, you could coax the yeast into producing any chemical compound or enzyme you like.That may sound like science fiction, but Arzeda says it's already a reality.The Seattle biotech startup is using this fermentation process to create \"everything from the material used to make the tent you take on camping trips, to eco-friendly paints, and even pharmaceuticals or food ingredients,\" according to CEO Alexandre Zanghelini.Arzeda's customers are using the technology in areas like agriculture and manufacturing.\"We are also using the technology to develop our own innovative products,\" said Zanghelini. \"We're looking forward to the day when industrial, environmental and health challenges are routinely addressed by designing the perfect molecule for the job.\"Arzeda is made up of a team of computational biologists -- Doctors Eric Althoff, David Baker, Daniela Grabs, and Zanghelini. Their work has been published in the academic journals Science and Nature.We caught up with Zanghelini for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire.Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"Arzeda uses synthetic biology and cloud computing to make the products we need more sustainable, perform better, and cost less.\"Inspiration hit us when: \"While at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design we realized how we could use cloud computing to sort through trillions of possible combinations, design new enzymes and assemble them into the best biochemical pathways to make custom-designed molecules. We published our results and founded Arzeda the same year.\"VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Bootstrap. Bootstrapping at first allowed us to experiment a lot in the marketplace and find the best commercial applications of our technology. It allowed us to gain solid traction in partnerships with large Fortune 500 leaders in their business.Bootstrapping also forced us to have the discipline to develop a very lean operation (we did not have running water when we started our lab operations). It's very rare in biotech, and we are very proud of that. We all worked hard to accomplish this and it certainly had an impact on our personal lives.Long term, to reach the scale we envision, we will need outside capital. But having paying customers, proof that the technology works and a lean organization is what any investor wants to see.\"Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Our secret sauce is found in the tight integration we have built between the latest biotechnology techniques and extremely powerful computing. That's why our geeks (software developers) and lab-rats (molecular biologists) work side-by-side in the same open space. We could choose to be a biotech company, or we could choose to be a software company, but the combination is what makes Arzeda greater than the sum of its parts.\"The smartest move we've made so far: \"Getting off the ground. Starting a company to build a synthetic biology technology platform that nobody has ever used before sounds like a big lift -- and it is -- but once we got started the momentum has carried us.Also, not spending $50,000 on a branding firm to create our name. We did it by rearranging the initials of the founders until we landed on something that sounded biotech-y.\"The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Some of our deals have taken longer to arrange than we expected. This is a brand-new technology, and countless industries can make use of it. It takes time to communicate the full potential.\"Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"We use AWS for our cloud services so the shout-out goes to Bezos. Still, all three of these guys know what it takes to innovate something entirely new. Maybe we can find a way to isolate the most successful genetics of each?\"Our favorite team-building activity is: \"We are headquartered in a Seattle neighborhood with loads of new microbreweries. It lends itself very well to team-building.\"The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"A strong alignment with our values, and a vision for synthetic biology and its potential to change the world for the better.\"What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"Running a startup will have an enormous impact on your personal life, so make sure what you are working for is worth the stress. That's what we have done and the ride has been great. We wouldn't want to be doing anything else.\"",

(WiBotic Photo / Chasen Smith)\nUniversity of Washington spinout WiBotic, which is building technology that wirelessly powers drones and other robotic devices, has raised $2.5 million in a new funding round.The round is led by Tsing Capital, a Chinese fund management company, and includes investments from Comet Labs and Digi Labs as well as follow-on investments from W Fund, WRF Capital and Wisemont Capital. WiBotic, originally founded within the UW's electrical engineering and computer science departments, will use the funds to enhance product development and beef up sales and marketing activities.The round brings the 10-person company to a total of $3.25 million in funding. CEO Ben Waters, who spoke at a UW Innovation Summit in Shanghai in 2015 that GeekWire attended, founded WiBotic with UW professor Joshua Smith.In addition to the funding announcement, WiBotic said it has moved into a new engineering and testing facility at UW's CoMotion Labs incubator program. CoMotion supported the company when it was just getting off the ground.The company says its product is more efficient than traditional plug-in charging technology because it allows drones and robots to charge autonomously, removing the need for human intervention while also increasing the lifetime of the battery itself. When a robot approaches, or when a drone lands near a WiBotic charger, the device automatically detects its presence and wirelessly charges the battery.WiBotic, which came out of stealth mode last year, also offers battery management tools and fleet-level power optimization.WiBotic customers range from companies in industries like agriculture and medical, to security, videography, and marine biology. The company sees the potential to add more customers in the future, as automation and robotics continue to advance. Last year, the company cited a study estimating that global spending on robotics and related services to grow to $135 billion by 2019.",

(Nextio Photo)\nAravind Bala had been at Microsoft for nearly 15 years when he met Anoop Gupta, his manager on the Office Mix team.After working together for a couple of years, they began kicking around startup ideas. Eventually, they came up with the concept for Nextio, a platform that pays users for responding to messages from recruiters and offers other career-related insights.\"Every day you receive messages from people outside your social networks,\" Bala said. \"A message from a recruiter about your dream job is very valuable to you. One from a Nigerian prince who wants to share his treasure -- not so much. Companies and individuals are spending real money to reach you ... but all of this money is going to a middleman.\"Nextio officially launched earlier this month, with Bala serving as Chief Technology Officer.\"I wear multiple hats at Nextio from architecting the product and writing code to talking to customers, working with legal and hiring,\" Bala said. \"About 70 percent of my time is spent in coding and working on the product, and 30 percent on strategies for getting traction and program management.\"During his 16 years at Microsoft, Bala was as a partner engineering manager on a wide range of products, including Bing and Office.We caught up with Bala for this Working Geek, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire.Current Location:  \"Redmond, Wash.\"Computer types: \"I use a Windows workstation at work and a Mac Pro for my laptop. I work with a lot of data for the Career Insights tool, and we have built a custom in-memory database which requires a ton of RAM, and so my main machine has 64 GB of RAM. Having worked at Microsoft for most of my career, I'm very used to Windows machines, but I wanted to try a Mac Pro for my laptop to get used to the Apple ecosystem.\"Mobile devices: \"I had been alternating between iPhone and Windows Phone while I was at Microsoft, but now I'm just using an iPhone. My current phone is an iPhone 7s, and I love the battery life and the screen.\"Favorite apps, cloud services, and software tools: \"Microsoft Office is my favorite productivity tool, in part, because I can hack it to do anything I want. In my previous jobs at Microsoft, I built a feature to be able to search over all the commands in Office and as part of that, I became familiar with every single feature in Office.At work, we use Visual Studio, Microsoft Azure, Node.js to build our software, and GitHub and Zenhub to manage our work items, issues and for project management. Zenhub is really great to manage our tasks on top of GitHub. We also use Slack for team communication.\"Describe your workspace. Why does it work for you? \"I have an identical computer setup both at work and at home with two 27-inch monitors. At work, we have an open space and it's great for collaboration, but when I need to get stuff done or work on hard problems I like to work from home without any distractions.Working in a small team at work is a lot of fun since we all get along great, and it's energizing to bounce ideas off each other. We also go out for lunch every day as a team and try out new restaurants. It's a nice break during the day, and it's great for team discussions.\"Your best advice for managing everyday work and life? \"Working in a startup tends to be all-consuming, but it's really important to carve out dedicated time for the family. I try to get home by 6 p.m. every day so that I can spend a few hours with my kids and wife, and then usually work later in the night after they have gone to sleep. In a startup, you are always severely under-resourced, so it's critical to prioritize to ensure that you work on the tasks that give you the maximum return for the amount of effort you have to put in.\"Your preferred social network? How do you use it for business/work? \"I use our platform Nextio for messaging, as well as Whatsapp and Facebook to keep in touch with friends and for articles of interest. I follow several people on Facebook who share interesting content, but given that Facebook tends to keep showing you stuff that you like, it's important to go out to other sites that might have the opposite viewpoint.\"Current number of unanswered emails in your inbox? \"Since we are a small team, we do most of our discussions in person, and sometimes Slack. We don't use Email as much, and so I only have 10-15 unanswered emails in my inbox.\"Number of appointments/meetings on your calendar this week? \"Depending on the phase of the product we are working on, I might have a lot of meetings or very few. Within the team, we do not usually have formal meetings, but we sync up every day when everyone is in the office. This week I only had one formal meeting, and several interviews as we are looking for a great software developer.\"How do you run meetings? \"We typically have two types of meetings - one about work items and priorities which are best discussed by working off a task board like Zenhub/GitHub, and brainstorming meetings that are more open-ended. While it is great to have robust discussions on various topics, it is important to designate an owner for the agenda item who can listen to all the arguments and everyone's feedback, but make the final decision.\"Everyday work uniform? \"Jeans and T-Shirt.\"How do you make time for family? \"I try to get back home by 6 p.m. every day so that I get to spend some time with them before my kids go to sleep. I also carve out some time to spend with my wife where we usually end up watching some TV before starting to work again at night.\"Best stress reliever? How do you unplug? \"The best stress relievers for me are playing tennis and listening to comedy. Instead of the typical garage startup, our office is a pool cabana. We have a tennis court next door. When the weather is good, it's great to get a half an hour of tennis in during the day.At home I love playing with my kids - we usually play tennis or cricket inside our house or in the backyard, and watching our favorite shows on TV with my wife.\"What are you listening to? \"In the morning, during my commute, I listen to the radio. My favorite radio station is Movin' 92.5 FM which plays the latest music and I love their morning show, 'Brooke and Jubal in the morning.' I find that listening to comedy in the morning puts me in a good mood for the rest of the day. I also listen to various podcasts on startups and user growth. My favorite podcast for startup-related topics is 'This Week in Startups.'\"Daily reads? Favorite sites and newsletters? \"I read the headlines on CNN and MSNBC, and get some of my news from Facebook. I also keep abreast of tech news at GeekWire, TechCrunch, and I subscribe to various startup-related newsletters like the Launch Ticker, the CB Insights newsletter, Term Sheet, First Round Review and Founder Hacks.\"Book on your nightstand (or e-reader) \"These days, I mostly read non-fiction books - many of them related to growing our user base and building products. Recent books I've read include Traction by Gabriel Weinberg, Play Bigger by Al Ramadan, Pre-suasion by Robert Cialdini and Payoff by Dan Ariely. The last non-business book I read was \"When Breath Becomes Air\", which is a very moving real story of the life of Dr. Paul Kalanithi who chronicles his journey as a doctor and his battles with cancer.\"Night owl or early riser? What are your sleep patterns? \"I am definitely a night owl. I try to sleep by 12:30 a.m., and I get up around 6:30 a.m.\"Where do you get your best ideas? \"I get my best ideas when I've been thinking about the problem for several days, usually when I get up in the morning having thought about solutions to the problem the previous night.\"",

He has been developing transparent evaluation and ranking systems for hospitals for over 30 years, something that has historically been lacking in the field. Pine sits on Mpirica's board and MPA is also an investor in the company.Mpirica's platform combines Pine's system with health insurance claims data gathered from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to come up with rankings for hospitals.

Stackery is a software tool, not a framework, and in addition to organizing and deploying code, we're really focused on connecting the underlying infrastructure and maintaining application health, particularly for large-scale applications.\"Stackery's unique approach to serverless development caught the attention of Voyager Capital Partner Diane Fraiman.\"On Feb. 10, Nate Taggart was in my office in Portland and he presented the best 30-minute, no-deck pitch that I had seen in 10 years,\" she said on stage at Demo Night. \"What Nate basically told me was that he and his co-founder, Chase Douglas, were going to build Stackery to disrupt the DevOps cloud infrastructure market with a serverless toolset ... On March 28, Voyager Capital put down a term sheet.\"Stackery is planning to expand its team of three to about twelve over the next year. The Portland-based startup delivered one of our favorite pitches at Demo Night. Read more about Stackery here and check out the other companies in the Techstars Seattle 2017 class here.",

    "content": "Redfin CTO Bridget Frey delivered the keynote before a class of male CEOs pitched during Techstars Seattle Demo Night. (GeekWire Photo / Monica Nickelsburg)\nIt's no secret that tech has a diversity problem. In fact, the lack of gender equity at tech events has become so quotidian that I almost didn't notice that each of the nine CEOs pitching on stage at last night's Techstars Seattle demo event were men.Gender inequity is a pervasive problem in the startup world. Just 17 percent of venture-backed companies in the first quarter of 2017 had at least one female founder, according to a recent study. The same was true for all of 2016 and the number has stagnated since 2012.Redfin CTO Bridget Frey addressed the issue head-on, as the keynote speaker at Techstars Seattle Demo Night.\"It's a really hard problem,\" she said. \"It takes a lot of effort and it's something that's hard to work on when you're at the beginning of starting a company; when you are thinking about getting your first prototype out the door; when you're thinking about getting funding. How do you make time to also think about building a diverse team?\"Although it was encouraging to hear from a woman who has broken down gender barriers and excelled in her field, as the rest of the program showed, she's still very much a minority.It's an issue that GeekWire struggles with too, as we seek out a diverse range of industry leaders to speak our events. But it's important not to let the ubiquity of the problem translate into complacency.Chris DeVore, managing director of Techstars Seattle, is well aware of how much work there is to be done. It was the impetus for a blog post, titled \"Failing, Frustrated + Asking for Help,\" that he wrote when this year's Techstars Seattle class was selected.\"My commitment to working with founders from underrepresented groups isn't just a way for me to feel good about myself or earn PR points for Techstars,\" he wrote. \"It's a deliberate strategy to back the most ferocious and relentless founders I can find, the ones who will walk through walls to deliver for their teams, their investors and themselves. I am failing in this work. And I'm asking for your help.\"DeVore ensured that members of the Seattle Female Founder's Alliance (SFFA) were seated up front during the event. Leslie Feinzaig, the group's founder and a Techstars Seattle mentor, wants to help the accelerator become more diverse.\"It is a problem that is bigger and broader than Techstars, and I don't believe there is a single solution nor a short-term one,\" she said. \"The SFFA is proving that the pipeline of female founders is a lot bigger than we thought -- we have 70 members today, an additional 30 applicants in due diligence, and new founders popping up every day -- and that's in less than two months. So, I think the next steps for us are to help female founders with applicant readiness, and partner with Techstars and other accelerators who are trying to create a truly inclusive environment.\"In 2015, the national Techstars umbrella announced a series of diversity goals, including doubling the number of women in the applicant pool and mentor network, publishing diversity data, and training staff on \"unconscious bias.\" The organization also created The Techstars Foundation, a non-profit that promotes diversity in the startup world through grants, scholarships, and sponsorships.But as DeVore noted in his blog post, Techstars Seattle is falling short of those goals. Here's what he says happened with the 2017 class:DeVore is asking members of the community to send him feedback on how Techstars Seattle can improve diversity, not just in the application pipeline but in the final class of startups that go through the program.Techstars Seattle plans to take that feedback and translate it into changes to the program later this year.\"Einstein famously said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results,\" DeVore says. \"I'm committed to achieving different results in our diversity recruiting, so I need to start doing some different things.\"",

(Boundless Photo)\nBoundless, a Seattle startup that aims to help people navigate the U.S. immigration process, has come out of stealth mode and announced $3.5 million in seed financing.The round was led by Trilogy Equity Partners, and Foundry Group, Founders' Co-op, Two Sigma Ventures and a group of strategic angel investors also participated. Boundless, a spinout of Seattle-based startup studio Pioneer Square Labs, will use the cash infusion to build and launch its first products, grow its engineering team and foster partnerships.Boundless' co-founders boast major tech credentials and five of the company's six staffers went through the immigration process themselves.In February, Boundless CEO Xiao Wang left his job as a senior product manager at Amazon, where he helped build and launch Amazon Go, the Seattle retailer's ambitious new convenience store operation to co-found and run Boundless. Wang came to the U.S. from Nanjing, China at three and went on to earn advanced degrees from Stanford and Harvard Business School before jumping into leadership roles in tech. He co-founded Boundless to ensure immigrants, like himself, have access to the same opportunities he had.Boundless' co-founders include President Doug Rand, who was assistant director for entrepreneurship in the Obama White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Chief Technology Officer Serdar Sutay. Sutay is an immigrant from Turkey, and he has led engineering teams at Chef and Microsoft.Boundless is working on its first product, which is focused on family immigration issues. It will emphasize helping U.S. citizens and Green Card holders apply for visas for their spouses. Prior to launching its first product, Boundless is looking to work with individuals and families in the Seattle area going through the spousal visa process.\"The immigration process is opaque, intimidating, and high-stakes,\" Wang said. \"As an immigrant, I know how frustrating the waiting process can be, particularly when your family's future is on the line. I am dedicated to giving everyone the information and tools they need to confidently and successfully navigate the legal immigration process.\"Boundless comes as President Donald Trump's immigration policies, including stalled travel bans from some majority Muslim countries, and possible changes to the H1-B work visa program, are sending shockwaves of anxiety through the tech community, which relies on a diverse talent pool.Boundless is Pioneer Square Labs' fourth spinout.

    "title": "Techstars Seattle Demo Night: Our favorite pitches from 9 up-and-coming startups",
    "content": "Nine startups pitched on stage during Techstars Seattle Demo Night. (Techstars Photo / Tim Mezen).\nAfter three months of intense work on their products, business models, and pitches, the Techstars Seattle 2017 class was finally ready to step into the spotlight.Nine innovative startups -- in a diverse array of fields ranging from serverless development to the seafood marketplace -- presented at Techstars Seattle Demo Night at the Museum of History and Industry last night.Now in its eighth year, Techstars Seattle is an incubator that provides early-stage startups with mentorship, guidance, and a $100,000 investment. It's part of the international Techstars organization.\"We now have more than 100 companies that have gone through the Techstars Seattle program since we started in 2010 and it's just one measure of those companies' progress, post-program they have raised, collectively, almost $400 million in capital,\" said Techstars Seattle Managing Director Chris DeVore during the event Wednesday.Each startup made a compelling case but a handful of pitches stood out from the pack. Continue for our favorites pitches, photos from Demo Night, and read more about each team in recent installments of our Startup Spotlight series.Hazel CEO Wisam Abdulla delivered his pitch with the confidence of an entrepreneur who believes in his product 100 percent.His enthusiasm, combined with a clearly identified problem, explanation of how his startup is solving it, and demonstration of early traction made Hazel's pitch one of the strongest in the bunch.Hazel makes enterprise software that helps companies get a bird's eye view on how well its managers are performing and provides ongoing feedback and training resources to help leaders improve.\"We've designed a new and truly effective way for companies to develop and enable their managers,\" Abdulla said.Hazel polls employees via Slack and other messaging tools to find out a manager's strengths and weakness. The service then provides resources to help leaders improve over time and encourages strong managers to become mentors for others who need help.The service costs $50 to $100 per manager, per month. Abdulla and his co-founders came up with the idea for Hazel when they were building Canadian payroll startup Rise. Their customers constantly complained about how hard it was to train great managers.Abdulla experienced this struggle firsthand, in his first leadership role. When a top player on his team departed, he was left wondering what he could've done differently as a manager.\"We help companies develop and enable their managers in a personalized ongoing and engaging way so that no one ever has to manage like I did in my first year,\" Abdulla said during his pitch.It's no easy feat pitching something as esoteric as \"solutions to build production-grade serverless applications\" to a crowd that's not exclusively software engineers. But it was clear from Stackery CEO Nate Taggert's conviction and a ringing endorsement from Voyager Capital's Diane Fraiman, that the startup is building something powerful.Stackery provides tools to help developers make apps that operate with the same level of efficiency and security as legacy applications, without relying on a server.\"We're at the beginning of a major revolution in infrastructure technology,\" Taggart said. \"Serverless is transforming the way modern applications are built and delivered in the same ways that cloud disrupted the physical hardware market. We have an exceptional team and we know this space.\"Taggart and Stackery co-founder Chase Douglas started working together in 2013 when they joined forces to build the New Relic Browser. Before that, Taggart was a product manager at GitHub and Douglas was an engineer for IBM.\"We know how to get our product in front of developers,\" Taggart said.Swym CEO Arvind Krishnan impressed the crowd Wednesday with the amount of early traction his company is enjoying.The startup, which helps small and medium e-commerce companies track shoppers across devices, is seeing 30 percent month-over-month growth, adding 100 stores every week, according to Krishnan. All of those sellers are coming to Swym through Shopify and the startup plans to integrate with additional e-commerce platforms soon. Krishnan says Swym is on track to hit 10 million users in the next year.\"This is just the beginning for us,\" he said. \"The real opportunity that we're going after, the mid-to-large retailers, collectively did over $120 billion in sales last year. And these stores are running their e-commerce sites on a handful of platforms.\"Swym allows retailers to re-connect with customers who have started a shopping session on one device and picked back up on another -- even if they haven't logged in. The software detects patterns between devices and users, creating a user profile with information on their social media profiles and shopping preferences.Krishnan brings with him experience working in product management for Microsoft and Yahoo.\"Swym is changing the way consumer shop on mobile,\" he said.",

    "title": "Just 17% of startups have a female founder -- the same percentage as five years ago",
    "content": "The percentage of venture-backed startups with at least one female founder has plateaued at 17 percent for the past five years. (Crunchbase Graphic)\nThere have been increasing efforts over the past few years to close the gender gap in tech, and particularly in startups. A high-profile scandal inside Uber's engineering division, and constant efforts from women in business and tech positions, have made diversity front-and-center in the minds of many.So how much have the headlines, the hours spent networking and the push for diversity in hiring changed the landscape for women at the heads of startups? Not much, it turns out.A new report from Crunchbase's ongoing study of female founders found that just 17 percent of venture-backed companies in the first quarter of 2017 had at least one female founder. The same was true for all of 2016.In fact, that number has held steady since 2012 -- apart from in 2015, where it was just 16 percent.The report also found that women-led startups receive fewer investment dollars than male-led startups at every stage of the funding process. The gap is particularly large in late-stage funding, where startups with at least one female founder raised just 8 percent of rounds and 7 percent of total dollars.The lack of movement in the founder gender gap over the past five years tells us something many women already knew: There's no silver bullet to solve diversity challenges.Many of the factors that influence gender gaps in startups, and more generally in tech industry leadership, have to do with deeply ingrained social and cultural norms. Unfortunately, there's very little research to help companies, investors and founders address the problem.A recent study from TinyPulse also indicates startup leaders have a blind spot when it comes to culture: the study found that leaders consistently rated their company's culture better than their employees did.The same study found that startups with female founders tended to grow faster, possibly because more diverse workforces are consistently found to lead to better results.",

Now the company is taking it up a notch with the help of machine learning.The Seattle startup today rolled out a new revenue planning product that uses machine learning to crunch historical data and better predict specific \"what if\" scenarios -- like increasing marketing spend for outbound calling, or reducing event sponsorship budgets, for example.Bizible CEO Aaron Bird called it the biggest product launch since his company started in 2012.\"We've been solving this problem indirectly since we launched, but now we've got to the point where we have a really good view of causality for marketing activities,\" Bird told GeekWire. \"The next level for us is to use all of that rich data we have about causality, layer on machine learning, and use that to predict the future around what is going to happen with your marketing efforts.\"Here's an example of what the new product looks like to a user (click to enlarge):Bird explained that most B2B marketing teams try to forecast by taking averages of conversation rates, velocity, deal size, and other factors. But this isn't the most effective way of planning for the future, he said.Bizible's machine learning algorithms help provide a projected revenue for every contact, lead, and opportunity based on each piece of historical data measured at a granular level.\"If you don't have a good understanding of causality in the past, then you can't do a good job of planning the future,\" he noted.Bird added that the new product is particularly valuable for B2B marketers who deal with longer sales cycles and need to forecast for several months out to the future.Bird, a former Microsoft program manager, started Bizible in 2011 and took it through Techstars in 2012. The company, which has raised $10.5 million to date, now counts more than 280 customers and expects its revenue to double this year. Bizible also just moved into a new office in Seattle where it employs 65 people -- that's up 50 percent from January -- and hiring will continue throughout 2017.",

(Cardiac Insight Photo)\nConsumer wearables, like smart watches and Fitbits, are becoming ever more popular. But wearable medical technology has remained somewhat absent from the scene, despite huge potential for improving patient care and potentially lowering healthcare costs.Kirkland, Wash.-based Cardiac Insight is hoping to break into that market with Cardea Solo, a lightweight disposable electrocardiogram (ECG) test that monitors a patient's heartbeat. The company has raised $4.5 million to develop and  commercialize the device and announced today that it has been approved for use by the FDA and is now available to healthcare providers.The company has raised $4.5 million to develop and  commercialize the device and announced today that it has been approved for use by the FDA and is now available to healthcare providers. Several existing private investors took part in the round.Cardiac Insight has been developing Cardeo Solo for several years, and it could reportedly cost as little as $20, making it highly accessible to patients.The Cardea Solo can be used to monitor the cardiac health of patients who have \"transient symptoms,\" like periodic lightheadedness or chest pains, which cannot be replicated in a doctor's office, Harlow said\"It's a very small, disposable monitor,\" Harlow said. \"A person can wear it for seven days, they can shower with it. It's worn under the clothing and it's very light, so you wouldn't observe it if someone was wearing it.\"The patient would then take the device back to the physician, who can print out a review of the patient's heartbeat over the time it was worn, Harlow said. The report can help doctors identify irregularities like atrial fibrillation or tachycardia, both of which can be signs of serious heart problems. The device is now available for purchase by care providers.A wearable ECG test is also produced by the San Francisco-based iRhythm, which went public in October. Unlike Cardiac Insight, iRhythm sells the test as a service instead of a device, acting as a go-between for patients and doctors.Cardiac Insight was spun out of the University of Washington in 2008 by Harlow and UW cardiologist David Linker. In 2015 the company acquired Cardea Associates and their device, CardeaScreen, which tests for heart problems in young athletes. It was brought to market last year and later rebranded as the Cardea 20/20 ECG. ",

QuoteWizard CEO Scott Peyree told GeekWire the layoffs were due to constrained spending by the insurance industry, where the company makes its money, and that the company was looking for more sustainable business solutions.Now QuoteWizard says it is projecting revenues of $75 million to $80 million for the year, and it posted a net profit of over $1 million in March. It's also hiring again for some positions. Peyree said the turnaround was both because of an upturn in insurance spending and because the company has started to see payoffs from tech and strategy investments.The 100-person company is now in the running for the Bootstrapper of the Year award at this year's GeekWire Awards, taking place May 4th at Seattle's MoPOP.\"The psychological impact of running a company where it is not only your own blood and sweat, but also all of your (and your partners) own money provides a focus and desire to succeed that you don't get when taking outside investment,\" Peyree told GeekWire earlier this week.The new CarrierCompare tool allows users to directly compare car insurance plans from 30 insurance providers, giving objective assessments on elements like consumer satisfaction and financial strength.\"We developed CarrierCompare to be much more than just a company database,\" QuoteWizard Content Manager Adam Johnson said in a press release.\"When users access a company page on CarrierCompare, they also have the option to directly compare it alongside another insurance company. This allows consumers to easily evaluate the policy options, potential discounts, strengths, weaknesses, and more, all free of charge.\"The bootstrapped startup has been family owned since its founding in 2006 and, for a time, was one of the fastest growing companies in Washington state.",

Tech titans, like Amazon and Walmart, are able to devote far more resources to their digital products than smaller companies have at their disposal.That's where Swym comes in. The Seattle startup has a platform that allows online retailers to provide features similar to Amazon's shopping history or Expedia's \"Scratchpad\" tool.Using Swym, retailers can track shoppers behavior across multiple devices, allowing them to follow-up with customers the next time they visit the website. If for example, a shopper adds an item to her cart while browsing on mobile, the retailer can remind her next time she visits the site on her laptop. Swym's technology works even if the shopper hasn't logged into an account.Watch the video below for an overview of how the product works.\"Consumer shopping journeys are becoming increasingly multi-device, and their expectations for what makes for a good shopping experience are constantly evolving,\" said Swym CEO Arvind Krishnan. \"It's becoming clear that brands that don't put digital convenience at the forefront will not stand much of a chance in the new landscape.\"Swym is a product of the TiE Silicon Valley incubator.

Swym helps e-commerce brands engage better with their mobile shoppers by accurately mapping a shopper's journey across devices, and using that context to deliver a truly personalized experience for them.\"Inspiration hit us when: \"We were frustrated by the mobile shopping experience offered by most retailers - it seemed pretty ordinary and hardly personal. Meanwhile, services like Netflix, Spotify, and Flipboard were delivering a 'wow' experience by making it all about the user, and what the user cares about. When we first encountered the Expedia Scratchpad, we thought all e-commerce sites should have that assistance capability and our vision started to come together for how we bridge those two worlds of e-commerce and personalized assistance.\"VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"It's been an interesting journey -- we were incubated at TiE Launchpad in Silicon Valley, raised some angel money subsequently, and are now part of Techstars Seattle. After a few failed experiments around the right path to scale, we've seen some incredible growth in the last eight months and are very excited about the road ahead.\"Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Being able to map the shopper journey across devices and leveraging that to deliver a personalized experience for them.\"The smartest move we've made so far: \"While the opportunity we are going after is broad and complex, it was important to focus initially on a specific segment and prove out our hypothesis. We made a bold call a few months ago to focus solely on the Shopify platform as our first stop, and that has worked out really well for us.\"The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"Trying to build a self-serve offering initially for a market segment that wasn't quite ready for self-serve. A few initial false positives sent us down the wrong path early on, but thankfully we course corrected before it was too late.\"Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"With a fair bit of Microsoft DNA in the team, there is always an inherent Gates bias, but we also feel his influence is already a part of who we are. And given our vertical and the focus on the customer experience, we'd hugely value having Jeff in our corner. Amazon's been absolutely amazing at demonstrating how relentless customer focus can be a massively successful strategy, and we definitely look to them for inspiration in more ways than one.\"Our favorite team-building activity is: \"We love our weekend 'hackathons' - every couple of months, we vote on a fun feature/module we want to build together, camp out at some remote, exotic location to build it, and don't get out until we are done. It'll be more challenging to keep this going as the team grows, but it's done wonders for team chemistry.\"The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Three things actually - passion for making a big impact, a relentless focus on getting things done, and a strong culture fit with the team.\"What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"You are going to hear \"no,\" a lot. Don't let that faze you - you are on this path for a reason.

The cash will be used to help the startup grow its app that provides a direct, interactive link between designers and consumers.Carney, who owns an independent clothing boutique that gives her a direct connection to designers, said the company will also use the funds to bring on new and established designers to Fashwire's platform.The company previously attempted a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter but canceled it to accept outside investments.Here's how the app works. Designers post pictures of new pieces to Fashwire and the app's users rate the piece, giving it a simple thumbs up or thumbs down. That feedback is returned to the designer in real-time, allowing them to tap into consumer trends as they are designing.On the flip side, consumers get a window into the design world, and as extra motivation, they can earn points and rewards for giving feedback.Here's a video from Fashwire that demos the app:The company joins an increasingly crowded field, with Seattle-based startups like Glamhive, Garmentory and Fitcode also taking a tech-focused angle on the fashion market. Big names like Nordstrom and Amazon are also looking for ways to innovate in the fashion world.Carney said Fashwire is now raising its Series A round and preparingfor a beta test ahead of its wider launch in August. So far it has 6,000 users and 1,400 designers signed up to be in the beta.Fashwire plans to make money by charging fashion designers a subscription fee; other revenue engines include advertising, sponsorships and product offerings.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Here's how Migo wants to become a search engine for on-demand transportation",
    "content": "Migo CEO Jeff Warren.\nA decade ago, if you were trying to get around in a city without a personal vehicle, there were a few options. You could utilize public transportation like a bus or subway; hail a taxi from the street; walk; bike; or have a friend drive you around.Fast forward to 2017, and technology has changed the game. Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft are prevalent in nearly every large U.S. city while car-sharing services like Car2go and BMW ReachNow are quickly gaining popularity. Consumers now have access to a bevy of transportation choices, all powered by your smartphone.But how do you know which is the cheapest, or which option will get you to your destination the fastest? Does it make sense to use car-sharing if surge pricing for apps like Uber and Lyft is in effect? What's the best option in your vicinity? And what services are even available in the city you're in?This is the problem Migo wants to solve.The Seattle startup continues to build out its app that acts as a real-time search engine for on-demand transportation. GeekWire wrote about Migo's $1.5 million investment round in February, but CEO and founder Jeff Warren talked more about the company's vision and technology in a recent interview.The app, which is still in beta mode with users in Seattle -- you can sign up for the beta here -- aggregates different transportation options, with real-time data on price estimates and wait time. It lets users hail and pay for a ride all from within the Migo app.Warren is a veteran of Expedia, where he led groups working on mobile products, regional marketing, and more. He also spent time with the travel giant's metasearch team, which built software that helped Expedia drive transactions and expand its brand across the world. Companies like Kayak, Trivago, and TripAdvisor have built entire businesses around the idea of metasearch.Warren's team at Migo, which includes former Expedia colleagues, is \"tuned toward understanding consumer search patterns,\" he noted.\"There are lots of parallels in personal transportation,\" Warren said.But Warren doesn't describe Migo as a \"Kayak for on-demand transportation\" and strays away from calling it a pure aggregator. He likens it more to a \"Netflix for personal transportation.\"\"It's all about discovery,\" he explained. \"You'll go on Netflix and watch your favorite show, but then it will get to know you and allow you to discover things you wouldn't otherwise. That's how we think about Migo -- it's definitely aggregation, but it's also just as much about discovery.\"Warren said the lightbulb went off when he started looking at transportation trends in cities. He said there are now 9-to-15 e-hailing options, on average, in cities across the U.S. and Canada, with many sprouting up in the past year or so. Urbanization trends suggest that usage of these services will only increase over the next decade, with fewer people relying on personal vehicles.\"What has evolved is a really rich ecosystem of personal transportation options in all these cities,\" Warren noted.Having so many more choices is good for consumers, but Warren realized that they often times aren't aware of all the options available, and even if they do, people don't typically like switching between 10 different apps. Also, based on the company's research, the \"best\" service for a specific user changes throughout the day and depends on time, location, and overall usage by other customers.That's why Migo's mission is about discovery.\"There are a lot of options,\" Warren said. \"It's just hard for people to know it.\"Migo hooks into APIs from apps like Lyft to funnel available options into its own app, allowing the user to search, book, and pay for a ride all within Migo. For apps that do not have APIs, Migo has developed its own virtualization platform that lets it re-represent external app data into Migo itself.Services like Lyft, Car2go, and Seattle Yellow Cab are on the app, but one particular service -- Uber -- is not.Warren said that in order to get all providers on Migo, and particularly the dominant ones, \"you have to have a value proposition for them: new customers or incremental business.\"\"Over time, just like we saw with Expedia, everyone will join, but we have to be at scale where we're interesting to everybody,\" he added.Migo makes money by charging a per-hail fee and a customer creation fee.Warren said that his team has discussed incorporating public transit data into its app, but for now it is focused on on-demand transportation providers.\"I don't think we can realistically take on the fragmented market of personal transportation and public transportation simultaneously,\" he said.There are several other competing services in this space: Ride Guru and Ride Fair, to name a few. Another one, RideScout, launched in 2013, called itself the \"Kayak of transportation,\" and was acquired by Daimler AG last year.But Warren thinks Migo's timing -- there are more mobility options than ever -- is the differentiator.\"The biggest and most fundamental difference is the ecosystem,\" he said. Migo has raised $2 million to date and employ 5-to-10 people.",

    "content": "Pluto VR lets you talk to other people within virtual reality apps. (Pluto VR Photo)\nPluto VR, the Seattle-based virtual reality startup co-founded by PopCap Games co-founder John Vechey, has raised $13.9 million in a Series A funding round.The company, which is developing applications for people to communicate within virtual reality, will use the cash infusion to continue research and development, roll out its alpha test to more customers and support additional platforms.Seattle-based Maveron led the round, with participation from Madrona Venture Group of Seattle, Trilogy Equity Partners of Bellevue and other individual investors. Maveron co-founder and General Partner, Dan Levitan, will join Pluto's board of directors.Maveron, founded by Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz and Levitan in 1998, has already backed three VR startups -- Virtuix, an active VR motion gaming platform; VicariousVR, a connected VR social network; and Against Gravity, a Seattle-based startup behind the hit VR game \"Rec Room.\"Anarghya Vardhana, a senior associate at Maveron, explained to GeekWire in February why the firm is so bullish about VR/AR.\"We see this as a way in which people interact with the world around them; with each other; with entertainment; with work,\" she told GeekWire. \"It's going to be a big computing shift, just like we saw a computing shift with the personal computer and cell phone.\"Pluto VR wants to be the application we use to talk to other people who are also wearing a virtual or augmented reality headset. The three-year-old Seattle startup is developing something like Skype or Facebook Messenger -- a communication app that can run on its own, or on top of other experiences -- but for virtual reality.\"The purpose of Pluto is to help humanity transcend physical location,\" Vechey said in a statement. \"While digital technologies today allow us to connect instantly from anywhere in the world with text, voice or video, they aren't necessarily bringing us closer together. With Pluto, you'll be able to connect with anyone anywhere, as if you were together in person.\"GeekWire visited Pluto's Seattle headquarters late last year and checked out its VR communication system. Pluto was a Seattle 10 company in 2015, and it employs 17 people at its Ballard office, which was previously occupied by pet insurance company Trupanion. It's much too large of a building for your typical 17-person startup, but it's perfect for Pluto given the technology it is building. The extra space and individual offices allow the company to better test its software.From its own app control panel, Pluto lets you create your own avatar, control the opacity of each person, mute mics or make \"calls\" to other people without needing an avatar, and more. For now, Pluto only uses avatars that show faces and hand movements -- which are trackable with headsets and accompanying controllers.Vechey said the company has no immediate plans to release its product more broadly, and that Pluto VR is focused on getting the little things right with alpha customers and rolling out slowly.",

Getting more VR experiences on the market was the impetus for the Viro Media, a startup he co-founded with longtime partners Raj and Vik Advani and Robin Har in 2015. Their goal is \"democratizing VR development,\" Moon said.Viro just closed a $2.5 million funding round to bring on more developers and accelerate that vision. The cash will go toward building out Viro's framework, which enables developers to create virtual reality apps and experiences using programming tools they already know.\"Our stack is our own 3D render engine combined with React Native so it's a familiar open-source framework from Facebook that lots of web and mobile developers are familiar with,\" Moon said. \"Now they can leverage their skills to start building for VR.\"The round was led by Lowercase Capital, SoftBank NYC, and Eniac Ventures with participation from Presence Capital, Box Group, Betaworks, Rugged Ventures.Prior to Viro, the company's four co-founders launched and built UpNext, a 3D mapping startup that sold to Amazon in 2012. The team stayed on at Amazon for a few years, helping to incorporate the technology into Kindle tablets and the now-defunct Fire Phone.\"We have always been very interested in 3D visualization technologies and when we saw VR, we immediately knew this is where we wanted to go,\" Moon said. \"We started building apps on some of the game engines and while we believe they're great tools, they didn't service the need we were looking for.

    "content": "The core Nextio team: Andy Nelson; co-founders Anoop Gupta (CEO) and Aravind Bala (CTO); Vikas Manocha; John Tippett; and Bentham Chang. (Nextio Photo)\nA new professional messaging service called Nextio aims to challenge a key feature of LinkedIn by turning the economic model on its head -- giving the recipients of messages most of the money paid by marketers, recruiters and others seeking to reach them.The Bellevue, Wash.-based company, formerly known as Telo, was co-founded by CEO Anoop Gupta, a former technical assistant to Bill Gates who previously led Microsoft's Unified Communications Group; and CTO Aravind Bala, a former Microsoft partner engineering manager who worked on products including Bing and Office.Nextio is launching today. Here's how the messaging feature works.Gupta and Bala say the idea is to align the interests of senders and recipients to deliver better value to both sides, making promotional messages more relevant and effective, and compensating the recipients of those messages for their time and attention.The suggested price per message ranges from 10 AUs ($1) to 100 AUs ($10), although recipients can also enter a custom amount.Nextio's approach is based on the concept that attention is the new currency, Gupta says.\"This is not a way people are going to get rich,\" said Gupta, putting the numbers in perspective. \"Many people will feel more comfortable donating to charities, but if the younger kids want beer money, that's good, too.\"However, this is a big market. Marketers, recruiters and others pay hefty premiums to get their messages out. Messaging is a core feature of LinkedIn's premium plans. Microsoft paid more than $26 billion to acquire the business social network last year. Facebook, which made more than $27 billion in revenue last year, charges brands to elevate their posts to reach more users.\"There's big money spent in getting to you,\" Bala said. The money will be spent somewhere. It can be spent on the middleman or it can be spent on you.\"Another big difference from LinkedIn: Everyone on Nextio is visible to others, eliminating the need to pay a premium for additional visibility into the people beyond your social circle. The service is free to end users.To help build a critical mass of users, Nextio also offers a feature called Career Insights, which uses natural language processing and machine learning to analyze a database of millions of public profiles -- showing users how people in similar positions have advanced their careers. It's designed to give people unique insights into the education, skills and experience they need to get ahead.In some ways, Gupta and Bala are competing against their former company with their startup, with LinkedIn now part of Microsoft. For end users, Nextio is not a replacement for LinkedIn's broader set of features, but the concept does pose a potential threat to its business model.Gupta and Bala both left Microsoft in November 2015 and came up with the Nextio idea in early 2016. Microsoft announced its agreement to acquire LinkedIn in June 2016. Nextio, then known as Telo, raised $2.2 million in funding in November 2016 from investors in Seattle and Silicon Valley. Nextio has a core team of six people, in addition to contractors.",

He's a firm believer that VR is next computing platform. He calls it an \"internet-sized opportunity.\"Investors seem to believe in his vision too. Against Gravity recently raised $5 million from Sequoia, First Round, Acequia, Vulcan, Maveron, and others.Fajt cut his teeth in VR for five years at Microsoft where he was an executive producer and principal program manager on HoloLens. He holds a Bachelor's degree in computer science from Cornell University.Grant Farwell has watched eSports take off in the past few years and he saw a big opportunity in this new market. The result was Matcherino, a platform that allows eSports fans to raise money to see their favorite gamers duel or pay to compete against the pros.Shortly after graduating from Techstars Seattle, Matcherino raised a $1.25 million seed round led by Madrona Venture Group.\"When many, many thousands of fans want to see certain professionals battle against each other and are willing to chip in money to make it happen, they need a technology platform to make it as easy as possible,\" Farwell told GeekWire. \"That is what we provide.\"Farwell graduated from Roger Williams University with a Bachelor's degree in economics.Ben Gilbert is a founding partner of Pioneer Square Labs, a \"startup studio\" that turns ideas into new companies and helps them get off the ground. But his entrepreneurial work goes further back than that.Gilbert is the former head of the Microsoft Garage, Microsoft's internal technology incubator, and co-founder of Madrona Venture Labs. He's been working in tech for nearly 15 years -- an impressive feat for a 27-year-old.Gilbert graduated from Ohio State University with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering, Entrepreneurship.Garett Ochs is always looking for problems that could be solved with technology -- the true mark of an entrepreneur. Shortly after graduating from the University of Washington, he built a phone case with a mirrored kickstand after many unsuccessful attempts to take a group selfie at a bar with friends.Now he's at the helm of Otto Robotics, a startup in stealth mode that's creating automated solutions for the restaurant industry. In January, Otto Robotics raised $1.5 million in private equity from investors like Draper Associates and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan Capital.Before Otto, Ochs was a mechanical engineer for Planetary Resources and Oculus. He has a Bachelor's degree in engineering and mathematics from UW.Yifan Zhang and Adam Stelle are pooling their combined startup experience to build Loftium. The startup, which is in stealth mode, promises to give home buyers \"a down payment in exchange for Airbnbing an extra bedroom for 12-36 months and splitting the income with us,\" according to the Loftium website.Zhang previously co-founded fitness app Pact and e-commerce site Styleta. She has a Bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard. Stelle was the former COO at Startup Weekend, founding partner at UP Global and entrepreneur in residence at Pioneer Square Labs.

(Coastline Image)\nYou'd be hard-pressed to find a marketplace more analog than fishermen selling seafood straight from the dock at the crack of dawn. Coastline Market sees that as a big opportunity.The Vancouver, B.C. startup has developed a digital marketplace that connects restaurants and retailers with local fishing operations. The platform allows customers to place and track orders, pay online, and find out where and how their seafood was harvested.Coastline CEO Robert Kirstiuk got the idea after watching dock workers sell the day's catch. He started asking more questions about the industry and quickly realized he could make the process more efficient using technology.Twenty-five restaurants and six fishing boats in Vancouver already use Coastline's platform. The startup is currently working through the Techstars Seattle 2017 class.We caught up with Kirstiuk for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire.Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"We connect restaurants and retailers to local commercial fishermen. We help eliminate middlemen with our online platform.\"Inspiration hit us when: \"I was visiting family in New Brunswick, Canada when I wondered why some fishermen preferred to sell direct off the dock instead of selling directly in the city.

This radically reduces the environmental and capital cost of preserving seafood, while providing clarity and transparency throughout the supply chain.\"The smartest move we've made so far: \"Moving to Seattle to accelerate our company through Techstars.\"The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"We hastily built our initial prototype without customer feedback, and ended up delivering a narrow-sighted solution with poor product-market fit. In the end, we had to discard the old codebase and start from scratch.\"Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Gates.

    "content": "Siren co-founders Susie Lee, left, and Katrina Hess. (Lance Mercer Photo)\nSound the alarm for women looking for something other than traditional dating apps: Siren is shutting down.The Seattle-based app, which billed itself as an alternative to sites such as Tinder and Match.com with a focus on empowering women, is closing its doors after running out of money.Siren co-founder Susie Lee penned a blog post Tuesday detailing the reasons for the company's shutdown. She noted that Blackrun Ventures, which last year invested $225,000 as part of Siren's seed round, had never \"completed their obligation.\"\"Instead, we received small, unpredictable amounts, with the other investors courageously stepping forward,\" Lee wrote. \"Through the dedication of these committed individuals we were able to continue development, however we could never plan beyond a few months, hindering growth, milestones, and new funding opportunities.\"In an interview with GeekWire, Lee said that \"all closing docs had been signed, but [Blackrun Ventures] never completed their commitment.\"\"Instead, they issued small, unpredictable tranches, often with months in between, despite sometimes daily requested updates and repeated assurances,\" Lee noted.Blackrun Ventures, which invested as part of its women-focused investment arm, still lists Siren on its portfolio page. We've reached out to the firm for more details and will update this post when we hear back. Update: On Friday, Blackrun responded to GeekWire and provided this statement:\"Blackrun Ventures joined a number of investors to participate in Siren's $500,000 seed funding round. As the lead investor, we committed $225,000, of which 75% was disbursed over the last 12 months following the completion of due diligence.We were committed to providing the remainder of the investment to support Siren's expansion, and sent our consultant to work with the team on their strategic direction. Unfortunately, the founders made a decision on April 4th to close down the company.The dating app market is crowded and highly competitive, but our reasons for investing in Siren were strategic, and we were won over by the vision and passion of the company's founders. Nevertheless, while we still see potential for the business, particularly internationally, we respect their decision.\"\"Despite the uncertainty shadowing us, we did our best to build on our momentum, doing everything within our power to stay afloat,\" Lee wrote in the blog post. \"But without a way to harness and distribute funds for expansion, we simply could not grow fast enough. The efforts of two co-founders alone were not enough to compete with the well-funded companies in this space. Unfortunately, this comes at a time when Siren showed strong traction--relocation and expansion to New York, the formation of key partnerships, and user success stories that let us know we were onto something special.\"Founded in 2014 by Lee and co-founder Katrina Hess, who served as COO, Siren differentiated itself from other dating apps by prioritizing women's safety and allowing users to engage through their answers to daily questions provided by local businesses and local cultural icons. The app relied on conversation as a starting point rather than long profiles or photo surfing.\"We've created the first mobile platform designed for unexpected and constructive flirting,\" Lee told GeekWire in 2014.After winning the GeekWire App of the Year award in 2015, Lee and Hess relocated Siren to New York City this past September as entrepreneurs-in-residence at the New Museum's incubator program, NEW INC.Lee said the company was \"pre-revenue,\" but had a three-pronged revenue model vision that included online-to-offline partnerships with local businesses, paid subscriptions, and \"psychometric data analysis of aggregate user responses.\"The app had 38,000 registered users, with an 80 percent response rate to initial messages, Lee noted. Siren had raised $960,000. Its only current employees are the two co-founders, who are both now back in Seattle.Here's Lee's full blog post:It is with heavy hearts--and eyes to the future--that we must announce that Friday, April 7, 2017, Siren will be closing our \"doors.\"While it's not unusual for a startup to run out of money, the way we ran out was as unexpected as it was devastating. At the beginning of 2016, we closed our round with a lead investor whose mission was to support female-centric companies and who saw the potential in Siren's clear differentiation in a saturated market. Yet, as of this writing, a full calendar year later, they have not completed their obligation. Instead, we received small, unpredictable amounts, with the other investors courageously stepping forward. Through the dedication of these committed individuals we were able to continue development, however we could never plan beyond a few months, hindering growth, milestones, and new funding opportunities.Despite the uncertainty shadowing us, we did our best to build on our momentum, doing everything within our power to stay afloat. But without a way to harness and distribute funds for expansion, we simply could not grow fast enough. The efforts of two co-founders alone were not enough to compete with the well-funded companies in this space. Unfortunately, this comes at a time when Siren showed strong traction--relocation and expansion to New York, the formation of key partnerships, and user success stories that let us know we were onto something special.Indeed, we are enormously proud of Siren's accomplishments and impact. One of our goals was to change the course of this industry--an industry historically run by men, rampant with harassment, objectification, and immaturity at every level. And as newer, better funded companies like Bumble and Hinge market themselves as relationship-friendly alternatives to Tinder, we can see how our early and persistent efforts to humanize the online dating space have influenced the conversation, and we hope this industry continues to grow in that direction.Every day our Question of the Day (QOTD) hosts brought a creative new question to the table, and as a result, Siren has amassed one of the best repositories of quality ice-breakers in online dating history. At the end of our run, our QOTD hosts included Arianna Huffington, Anita Sarkeesian, and Esther Perel. Working with these inspiring women was a dream come true for us, and we only wish we had the runway to match the rest of our hustle.Siren was a lightning rod for progressive spirit in the tech community, bringing together a dynamic group of advisors and investors whose fundamental integrity and respect for women's issues is unparalleled and unique. It was only after meeting hundreds of people in tech that we could truly appreciate the courage and forward-thinking determination of everyone who signed on to help Siren make the tech world a more intuitive, humane place. Our advisors and investors rallied us on and supported us in our darkest days, and here at the end, they are with us, restating how honored they are to have been part of this venture.Siren's story inspired over 200 pieces of press, from the front page of the Seattle Times to CNN, NPR and the Guardian, to Bustle, the Stranger and The Establishment. Durex reached out to us to partner on a marketing campaign #Connect that garnered over 37 million views. We won Geekwire's App of the year, beating Starbucks and Alaska Airlines in 2015. We presented at TEDx. We spoke at Grace Hopper, the world's largest conference on women in technology, and we partnered with experimental marketing group Hello Velocity on a viral Tinder hack that satirized the objectification inherent in the swipe-to-reject model. We became entrepreneurs in residence at the New Museum's incubator, NEW INC in New York City. And we accomplished all of this with a marketing budget of zero dollars and a team that never grew beyond 2-4 core members.Some founders of social networks have revealed that they began to dislike their members as they grew, a sentiment we found surprising, as we have always loved our community: a creative, optimistic, and thoughtful group who supported us from the very beginning, kindly reporting issues, enthusiastically sharing their beautiful success stories, and thanking us for helping them find someone who saw them in a real, intimate, and deeply human way.One woman told us that she had not been able to date for over seven years, and met a wonderful, kind man on Siren who had renewed her faith in relationships.Another wrote, \"In March 2015, I introduced myself to someone. I'm happy to say two years later we're still enjoying each other's company and refer people to your app all the time. Thanks for a great, easygoing way to introduce yourself online.\"Some jobs require a leap of faith to imagine that you are doing something meaningful in the world, but every time our members share a success story or their wedding photo with us, we knew the work we were doing was important. These are the people we knew we were fighting for. It was their chance, unexpected encounters that let us know our mission was worthwhile, and it is for that community most of all that we grieve this loss.Siren's ethos of fostering real conversations in a comfortable space based on mutual respect will live on in our future projects forever. Follow us individually to hear what happens next, and thank you so very much for your enthusiasm, your partnerships, your hope for our success, and your sharing in our every triumph and struggle. We can't thank our community enough for standing beside us and showing the world that Siren's mission was a vital presence in the history of online dating.Goodbye, and thanks for everything.Susie Lee & Katrina Hess\nCo-founders of Siren",

(Crelate Photo)\nCrelate, a startup with offices in Bothell, Wash. and Bethesda, Md., has closed a $1.2 million investment round led by the Alliance of Angels.The startup, which makes software for recruiters, plans to use the cash to grow its business and development teams. The funding will also allow Crelate to bring on a new CTO so that co-founder Aaron Elder to move into the role of CEO. Clint Simon, a startup vet who has worked with Elder at several previous businesses, will be joining the team as CTO\"Through all of my previous companies, I've always playing the CTO role, it is especially rewarding for me to be able to step back and guide the growth strategy for Crelate,\" he said.Elder and co-founders Mark Barrett and Michael Speca have worked together for nearly two decades at companies like Ascentium, Avanade, and BES Capital.\"They've had a couple of successful prior exits (i.e. they founded and sold a couple of startups in the past and made money for everyone involved), and this is a domain they understand well,\" Alliance of Angels Managing Director Yi-Jian Ngo said when GeekWire asked why the organization invested. \"In addition, there was also some market validation in the form of paying customers.\"Crelate's tools help recruiting and staffing agencies track job candidates, follow-up on leads, and schedule interviews.Over the next few years, Crelate aspires to expand beyond recruiting and build tools for talent management and workforce engagement.\"Problems that become even more challenging with the rise of freelancing, contingent staff, and the need for on-demand employment,\" said Elder. \"We believe we can facilitate the full lifecycle of this increasingly complex and agile employment landscape.\"Crelate currently has 14 employees across the two coasts.",

    "content": "Solving the New York Times crossword in the Puzzazz app, switching automatically between digital pen and pencil using Apple Pencil, while watching a movie using Apple Split View on an iPad. (Puzzazz Image)\nPuzzle technology company Puzzazz has a history of developing novel input techniques for people who solve crosswords and other puzzles on mobile devices, and it's continuing the tradition with the latest update to its digital puzzle bookstore and puzzle-solving app for Apple's iOS.The newly released Puzzazz 5.0 comes with a feature that let solvers using an Apple Pencil or 3D Touch automatically switch between virtual pencil and pen input modes depending on the amount of pressure they put on the screen. A lighter touch results in virtual pencil mode, while a harder press activates pen mode, eliminating the need to manually switch between the two modes.The company says it's the first such usage of pressure-sensing technology. The feature works in Puzzazz with the Apple Pencil on iPad Pro and with regular finger input on iPhones that support 3D Touch.Virtual pen and pencil input have been available previously in the Puzzazz app, but not the ability to switch between them based on pressure. Virtual pencil input helps solvers remember which letters they were less confident about, and it doesn't count those answers against them when determining if they've correctly solved the puzzle. If the puzzle is completely filled in with pen with at least one wrong entry, it's marked incorrect.In testing, solvers were able to discover how the new pressure-sensitive switching worked without reading any documentation, a testament to the amount of work that the Redmond, Wash., startup put into the feature.\"We knew we wanted it to feel natural, but getting from that basic idea to something that feels right meant building, testing, tweaking, and iterating until it worked naturally and smoothly,\" explained Roy Leban, Puzzazz CEO and founder. \"Nobody had ever done this before, so it wasn't like we could look at what others had done.\"In addition, the updated app works with Apple's Split View feature on supported iPad models, for solving a puzzle in a portion of the screen while watching a video or other content side-by-side with the puzzle. Puzzazz also supports the iPad's Slide Over feature, letting solvers search for answers on the web without leaving the app.Puzzazz is akin to Kindle for puzzles -- an app for purchasing puzzle e-books and solving a wide variety of puzzles. It recently surpassed 100 puzzle e-books in its store. The app offers free daily KenKen and Sodoku puzzles, and gives New York Times digital crossword subscribers a high-tech platform for solving the popular NYT puzzles.Support for the New York Times puzzles was simplified and improved in this latest version. Other new features in the latest Puzzazz update include Bluetooth keyboard support, the ability to rate puzzles, and support for Quick Actions -- the option to use 3D Touch to go straight to the NYT crossword or featured titles from the iOS home screen.The app continues to offer Puzzazz's previously released \"TouchWrite\" feature, which lets puzzle solvers trace letters and numbers in large form across the screen, automatically recognizing and inserting the characters into the fields of a crossword, Sodoku or other puzzle. TouchWrite is a previous Innovation of the Year winner in the GeekWire Awards.",

    "content": "Arivale CEO Clayton Lewis and co-founder Lee Hood, center, accept the award for Startup of the Year at the 2016 GeekWire Awards. (GeekWire Photo)\nThe 2017 GeekWire Awards are less than a month away, so that means it's time to vote for the iconoclastic tinkerers, entrepreneurs and business leaders who are reshaping the way we live, work and play.We're kicking off online voting today, and we're doing it in style with one of the biggest award categories: Startup of the Year.This year's finalists are looking to revolutionize everything from transportation to retail to auto maintenance. The finalists also include a Fred Hutch spin-out that's pioneering a treatment for Leukemia, and a well-funded cloud tech startup that's led by the co-creators of Kubernetes.It's one of the strongest finalist groups we've ever seen. Now, it's up to you to help pick the winner.To qualify for this award, startup companies had to be based in the Pacific Northwest and four years old or less. We received dozens of nominations from GeekWire readers, and our illustrious judging panel helped us winnow the group to the five finalists. You can read more about each company and cast your ballot for one of the five finalists for Startup of the Year in the poll below.Over the next two weeks, we're opening voting in 14 GeekWire Awards categories, with GeekWire readers choosing their top picks from finalists selected by our panel of judges from community nominations. Check back on GeekWire each day to cast your ballots. All of the winners will be revealed at the GeekWire Awards -- presented by Wave Business -- on May 4 at the Museum of Pop Culture.Tickets are on sale for the big Awards show, but we sell out each year, so don't snooze if you want to join the fun. Tickets available here.A big thanks to League for sponsoring the Startup of the Year category.

You'll be refreshed and limbered up by the time the Awards hit on May 4th! Convoy: 10-4 good buddy! This Seattle startup is making inroads in transforming the trucking industry, creating a more efficient way to match truckers with the loads they carry. It's an $800 billion industry in the U.S., and Convoy has some big believers. Led by former Amazon general manager Dan Lewis, Convoy raised $16 million in venture capital last year from a who's who in the tech industry, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, Greylock and others. It also scored a major coup earlier this year when it poached Tim Prouty -- formerly of Uber and Isilon -- as its engineering leader.Heptio: You don't see many startup teams with the technical chops found at Heptio, which emerged last year with an $8.5 million series A investment from Accel and Madrona Venture Group. Heptio co-founders Craig McLuckie and Joe Beda were two of the original founders of the Google-based Kubernetes project, big names in the world of cloud computing and containerized software. Before that, they cut their teeth at Microsoft. Now, at Heptio, they see an opening to create a set of services around Kubernetes, an open source technology that helps developers manage large fleets of containers. It's geeky stuff, and Heptio sees an opportunity. \"It became clear to Joe and me that there's a gap we'd like to fill, which is providing this very neutral, open, community-friendly company to continue to evolve the agenda we started when were were inside Google,\" McLuckie told GeekWire last fall.Nohla Therapeutics: A 2015 spin-out from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Nohla Therapeutics is looking to transform the treatment of blood cancers through unique universal donor cellular therapies. The company, which uses technology originally pioneered by scientist and Chief Medical Officer Colleen Delaney, received a ringing endorsement last year when it scored a $43.5 million Series A investment from Arch Venture Partners, 5AM Ventures, and The Jagen Group, bringing total funding to $65 million. It also tapped pharmaceutical veteran Kathleen Fanning as its CEO earlier this year.ReplyYes: Seattle has a history of pioneering retail technology. And ReplyYes, led by startup vet and former Amazon general manager Dave Cotter, is looking to make the next stride in how products are sold. A spinout of Madrona Venture Labs, ReplyYes describes itself as a chat commerce startup, essentially making it easy for retailers to sell products via text message. It's first offering, The Edit, is focused on vinyl record sales, and allows customers to purchase records by simply replying \"yes\" to an offer. \"It's ridiculously frictionless,\" Cotter told GeekWire last year. ReplyYes has raised $6.5 million in startup financing.Wrench: Going to the auto mechanic shop to get your car fixed might rank right up there with dental visits. So, what if the auto mechanic came to you? That's the idea behind Wrench, a Seattle startup that brings car maintenance to your front door. Wrench, which raised $4 million in funding last month and is led by Seattle native and former InfoSpace exec Ed Petersen, currently operates its on-demand car mechanic service in Seattle, Phoenix, San Diego and Portland. Dubbed an Uber for car mechanics, Wrench's network of mechanics will work on cars in driveways, parking garages or office parking lots, with the company saying it can complete about 80 percent of maintenance issues on site. The company employs 30 people.",

    "content": "Madrona Venture Group's S. Somasegar and Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia previously worked together as Microsoft executives. (Madrona Venture Group Photo)\nSnowflake Computing, the Silicon Valley-based cloud data warehouse startup that just announced a new engineering center in the Seattle region, has closed a $100 million funding round led by ICONIQ Capital, with Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group coming on board as a new investor.The additional funding will be used to expand Snowflake's data warehouse-as-a-service internationally, further develop its technology, and grow its engineering team with a \"special focus\" on building its new operations in Bellevue, Wash., the company said in announcing the funding this morning.\"We're growing like crazy,\" said Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia in an interview this week. \"It's a big world we're in, and it's time for us to expand and grow.\" It's a huge market that's only growing every day as there's more data in the world.The additional funding underscores the strong investor interest in new enterprise technologies built natively for the cloud. The additional $100 million brings the San Mateo, Calif., company's total funding to $205 million. Previous investors Altimeter Capital, Redpoint Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures and Wing Ventures also participating in the new Series D funding round.Madrona's participation as a new investor also represents a reunion for Muglia and S. \"Soma\" Somasegar, a Madrona managing director who worked with Muglia for many years at Microsoft. Somasegar led Microsoft's Developer Division, while Muglia was president of the company's Server & Tools Business.Although this is a later-stage investment than Madrona typically makes, a variety of factors made it a compelling deal for the firm, Somasegar said in an interview.\"We get excited about people who are doing great things in the cloud, and this is one of the great companies in terms of what they are doing in the cloud and for the cloud, right from day one,\" Somasegar said. \"It's a huge market that's only growing every day as there's more data in the world.\"Confidence in Muglia and the Snowflake leadership team also played a significant role in Madrona's decision, Somasegar said. Snowflake was founded in 2012 by database architects and Oracle veterans Benoit Dageville and Thierry Cruanes. Its third co-founder, Marcin Zukowski, is credited with inventing vectorized query execution in databases. Its head of engineering, Sameet Agrawal, spent many years at Microsoft, heading the SQL Server Relational Database Engine.\"I have a tremendous amount of respect, admiration and appreciation for Bob,\" Somasegar said. \"Having that deep database background with a seasoned business leader like Bob makes for a great team. The team is awesome.\"Snowflake's new engineering office in Bellevue also positions Madrona to provide additional value to the company given the venture capital firm's presence in the Seattle region, he noted.Even though Snowflake's cloud data warehouse runs on AWS, it competes with Amazon's own Redshift data warehouse -- not an uncommon situation in the modern world of cloud technology. In a post about its participation in the round, Madrona cites a recent GigaOm analyst report that ranks Snowflake as the top cloud analytics database over Google BigQuery, Teradata, Azure Data Warehouse and AWS Redshift.Muglia said the new funding will allow the company to expand its sales reach, hiring more people in the U.S., while also covering geographies such as Europe and ultimately Asia. Snowflake currently has salespeople in London and plans to expand into other parts of Europe this year.At its Bellevue engineering office, the company is starting with team of four engineers and one product manager, but it's targeting at least 10 to 15 engineers this year and could eventually have as many as 50 to 100 engineers in the office, Muglia said previously.Snowflake declined to disclose the valuation placed on the company as part of the new investment round.",

    "title": "Data storage and analytics startup Qumulo raises another $30M, total funding up to $130M",
    "content": "Qumulo CEO Bill Richter. (Madrona Venture Group Photo)\nQumulo has spent the past five years building out its cloud-based platform that helps companies store and manage their data usage. Now the company is ready to attract enterprise customers from around the world and become a globally-recognized brand.The Seattle startup today announced a $30 million investment round led by new investor Northern Light Venture Capital, with participation from previous investors like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Madrona Venture Group, Top Tier Capital Partners, and Tyche Partners.This follows a separate $32.5 million investment in June of last year. Total funding in the 5-year-old company is now $130 million.Qumulo helps clients in a variety of industries like film production, oil and gas, life sciences, and more not only store data, but also monitor it with real-time analytics.Qumulo CEO Bill Richter, who joined the company this past November, said the fresh investment is \"all about fueling growth.\"\"This round is all about taking a best of breed product that's built for the modern world, marrying it up with a world class leadership organization, and really going out and prosecuting a large, growing, and uncontested market,\" Richter told GeekWire.Richter took over for Qumulo co-founder Peter Godman, who is now CTO. The two colleagues previously worked together as executives at Isilon Systems -- as did Qumulo's two other co-founders Neal Fachan and Aaron Passey -- which sold to EMC for $2.25 billion in 2010, marking one of the biggest acquisitions in Seattle tech history.Richter, also a venture partner at Madrona Venture Group -- one of Seattle's top venture capital firms and one of Qumulo's earliest backers -- said he's more bullish about Qumulo compared to what he experienced at Isilon.\"Our opportunity is so much bigger than Isilon because the rate of data creation in the world is only accelerating,\" he said. \"The problem is even more pronounced; the market is so much larger; and the choices are much fewer for customers.\"The \"problem\" Richter referenced is all about how to manage and monitor a company's unstructured data usage. Qumulo helps companies understand where the consumption of resources is coming from and learn why so much data exists in the first place.Qumulo's Core product helps answers questions like, \"What was my data like six months ago?\" or, \"What data do I need to back up?\" or, \"What is driving my data growth?\" Qumulo Core can run on commodity hardware, dedicated appliances, or in virtual machines.\"Every business out there is becoming a digital business,\" Richter noted. \"Data is becoming the most important asset for any organization.\"Qumulo has more than 100 customers including companies like Crafty Apes, which used Qumulo to help with the 2D compositing for the opening scene in La La Land, and Sinclair Oil, which uses the technology for its new digital repository.Richter said Qumulo is in a $10 billion market, with few competitors given the complexity of the problem and potential solutions. He said three qualities -- software-defined (can run both on-premises and in the public cloud); built for modern scale; data analytics -- help separate Qumulo from other similar products.\"Customers today have really lousy choices,\" he explained. \"They can buy legacy solutions built in the 1990s or early 2000s from companies like Dell, Hitachi, or Net App, but those systems just fall over under today's definition of scale. They were never built to be able to store and manage information like the type of data we have today.\"Richter said some companies can rewrite their applications and try to leverage public cloud solutions like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure -- Qumulo views them as \"strategic partners\" -- but that most don't have the time, money, or expertise to do so.Qumulo employs 150 people and recently made a few key hires. In November it brought on tech industry vet Eric Scollard as its vice president of worldwide sales, and in February it hired Amazon and Chef veteran Jay Wampold as its vice president of marketing.\"There's been a lot of momentum around the leadership team and bringing in a new level of horsepower to really grow the business,\" Richter noted.As for a potential public offering, Richter said Qumulo \"certainly has the opportunity\" and will raise additional capital at some point in the future.\"But we're not really focused on things like an IPO,\" he said. \"We are focused on growing a long-term, highly successful and independent company. This financing round gives us a lot of flexibility and fuel to grow.\"Feng Deng, founding managing director of China-focused Northern Light Venture Capital, described Qumulo as a \"high-growth company at the crossroads of innovation and disruption.\"\"We are seeing a massive explosion in digital file data worldwide,\" Deng said in a statement. \"Qumulo addresses the challenge of unstructured data growth and management that incumbents have found impossible to solve. Northern Light is committed to helping entrepreneurs build world class companies through our expertise and resources and Qumulo fits that investment profile as a high-growth company at the crossroads of innovation and disruption.\"",

    "title": "Distelli aims to improve multi-cloud software development with new open-source container registry",
    "content": "Rahul Singh, CEO and founder of Seattle-based cloud infrastructure automation provider Distelli.\nBuilding and deploying software to run in the cloud is a challenge, particularly when customers want to run their applications in multiple clouds. It's also clear that a multi-cloud world is where the industry is headed, with Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy telling a University of Washington audience earlier this year that \"there are going to be multiple successful players\" in the word of the public cloud.Seattle-based cloud infrastructure automation provider Distelli CEO and founder Rahul Singh has been watching that trend, and has launched a new open-source container registry called Europa to allow customers to more easily use Docker images stored in a container registry on both on-premises data centers and cloud environments from multiple providers.The popular Docker container technology is now vital in developing software optimized for the cloud. Docker allows developers to bundle together pieces of an application to run smoothly across different platforms and devices. Singh, who worked at Amazon for nine years and was one of the earliest to join the AWS team before founding Distelli, says he understands the customer need for running in multiple clouds. With Europa, Distelli wants to provide the tools and technology to make that easier.\"Many customers use AWS but want the flexibility and freedom of using multiple cloud providers depending on their use case, business and needs,\" he said in an interview with GeekWire. \"The consequence of using multiple clouds is that your code and data may be isolated in one cloud and inaccessible in another.\"He said that Distelli wants to provide an effective bridge between these clouds as customers increasingly use Docker images as the primary way to package and deploy their work.\"Docker images are stored in a container registry and all the major cloud providers have one. Our enterprise customers want to use images stored in one cloud provider's container registry across multiple clouds,\" said Singh. \"They want this flexibility without losing key capabilities like fine-grained access control, audit trails and approvals. That is why we built Europa.\"Singh said Europa allows enterprises to store their Docker images in a container registry in one cloud, but easily push images from that registry to multiple clouds and keep them in sync.\"This makes it easy to build a docker image and then easily deploy it to ECS (Amazon EC2 Container Service) from ECR (Amazon EC2 Container Registry) but also deploy it to Google Container Engine (GCE) via the Google Container Registry (GCR),\" he added. \"This freedom and flexibility of being able to use multiple clouds is good for the customers and good for the cloud providers because it opens up so many possibilities that ultimately drive innovation and better software faster.\"Distelli, which raised $2.8 million in a round of funding from Andreessen Horowitz in 2015, is also making Europa open source.\"Open source drives adoption which eventually leads to evangelism (if the product is good) which in turn leads to sales,\" he explained, suggesting that he believes open-source products are becoming mainstream and that customers are changing the way they look at open-source products. \"The one myth of open source is that open source is lower cost - primarily because the licensing costs are zero. This is a myth because in a large company the licensing costs for software are dwarfed by the cost of engineering time and opportunity costs of time spent building your own solution.\"Singh said that Europa is available in three versions - a free Community edition, a $39 per user per year Premium version and an Enterprise edition at $99 per user per year. Only the Community edition is open source.Of course, Distelli is by no means the only company driving strategies for greater and easier use of containers -- or multiple clouds.Microsoft announced in February that it was broadening its support for the open source Kubernetes container manager, while IBM made a series of announcements at its InterConnect conference in Las Vegas last month underscoring its commitment to helping customers run and manage data in multi-cloud environments.Editor's note: Distelli CEO Rahul Singh will be one of the featured speakers at the GeekWire Cloud Tech Summit on June 7th in Bellevue. Additional speakers and details on this inaugural event here. ",

    "title": "Guest Post: I launched the 2.19% Founders Alliance to help women in tech help each other",
    "content": "VentureKits Founder Leslie Feinzaig launched the Seattle Female Founders Alliance to help women in tech get ahead. (Photo by Meryl Schenker)\nI don't actually want to talk about how hard it is to be a woman in tech. I realize this is an unoriginal statement. Unfortunately, with time and experience, I've had to face the reality that our industry is not a meritocracy. Even though I want to believe it is.Last summer, inspired by my career in tech and the birth of my daughter, I started a company with a mission to introduce kids to entrepreneurship, so that all kids can have a more equal chance to become tomorrow's leaders. In the process, I learned firsthand what I had only heard about before.I thought it was hard to be a woman in technology. It pales in comparison to what you face as a female startup founder.And while venture-scale entrepreneurship is hard on anyone, consider this: only 2.19 percent of venture capital invested in 2016 went to female-founded companies. In other words, what is already a moonshot for men is orders of magnitude harder for women.The good news is that there is no shortage of people trying to help. I feel tremendous gratitude to all of them: mentors, investors, bankers, executives, connectors, lawyers, advisors, recruiters, event organizers, journalists, non-profits, activists, and more. I thank you all sincerely. Please, don't stop doing what you're doing.But it's hard for me to sit on the sidelines for long on an issue that affects me so personally. Like any entrepreneur, I would rather fix a problem than wallow in it. So I gave it some thought and decided to try something simple, a minimum viable idea: What if founders intentionally helped one another? What if we built an alliance that enabled our efforts to scale?I decided to lead by example, going out of my way to help every female founder by connecting with them, amplifying their message, and referring them to people who can really move the needle for their startup. Every time I did so, I asked them to pay it forward to other female founders.I realize these actions -- connect, amplify, refer -- could very well be the start of a future awesome acronym. But CAR? It's missing something. I have some ideas on what goes next. You can add yours in the comments.I also realize most people already do much of what I described. It's part of what you do as a startup advisor (in return for equity and sometimes cash), and many people do it for their friends for free. But if we always charge, and only help the female founders in our immediate circle, our efforts just won't scale. And without scale, we will never put a dent in the 2.19 percent.So, I started a private Facebook group and added all my female startup founder friends in and around Seattle. Then they added their friends, and they added their friends, and then there weren't many more women left to be added, because there are just not that many of us around here to begin with (see 2.19 percent). It didn't take long for group members to take the initiative and organize ways to help each other. All of the sudden, founders who had never met in person were having a direct and positive impact on each other within days of meeting online.We now call ourselves the Seattle Female Founders Alliance (I like to call us the 2.19 percent Alliance). As of today, we are 60 (and counting) startup founders, startup CEOs, and founders who have had an exit. The group includes every female startup founder or CEO to win a GeekWire Award and nearly every female founder or CEO to raise a major round locally in the last three years, as well as up and comers that most of you haven't heard of... yet.Wanna join? It's super easy! All you have to do is identify as a woman and start a venture-scale company or social enterprise, and work on it full time (or have a successful exit by the time you join). It must be legally incorporated, have an online presence, or other solid evidence that you really took the leap. If you check all those boxes, fill in this form and we'll be in touch. If you're not a female founder, but you support our mission, we want to hear from you too.Once you join, you will meet some of the most amazing women I have ever come across. You will most likely experience their active support straight away. You will get a chance to meet some in person at our private meetups. And you will benefit from the events we are collectively organizing -- like our inaugural Founders Showcase in May, a private event for Seattle's investing community to meet Seattle's Female Founders.But this isn't just a networking group. Joining comes at a price: a price you have to pay forward.You'll have to connect with other founders, learn about their company and ask how you can help.You'll have to amplify all the other founders' voices and messages. Sometimes you'll have to share the spotlight.You'll have to refer other worthy founders to needle-movers, like investors, media, customers, conference organizers, and potential employees. Imagine if you walked out of every investor meeting having name-dropped three other alliance members. Now imagine we all did the same, every founder, at every meeting, with every investor.Individually we are drops of water. Together, we're a thunderstorm.Seattle female founders and CEOs, and female founders of the world: We need each other. Let's help each other succeed. Join us and pledge to connect, amplify, refer, and the other thing(s) that are missing from the future awesome acronym. Let's break the 2.19 percent, and not just by a little.And when we do, let our startup stories and battle scars have no more to do with our gender, and everything to do with our relentless quest for customer love, ROI, employee happiness, and positive societal impact.",

(Hazel Photo)\nAs Wisam Abdulla and his co-founders were building Canadian payroll startup Rise, they encountered a common complaint from customers again and again.Help with payroll was all well and good, they said, but how could they better manage their employees and foster company culture?Hazel is Abdulla and his team's answer. The Vancouver, B.C. startup uses software to help managers identify their weaknesses and improve as leaders.\"They say that employees don't leave companies, they leave managers -- and the research agrees,\" Abdulla said. \"And yet most manager training and development solutions are outdated and ineffective; they're often one-day courses that do little to change management long-term. Our goal is to give managers the tools and resources they need to grow and develop, based on the areas where their teams need them the most.\"Hazel is currently incubating in the Techstars Seattle accelerator. We caught up with Abdulla for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire.Explain what you do so our parents can understand it: \"Great managers build more engaged, enduring teams. Hazel gives clarity on where managers are struggling and tools to develop their skills.\"Inspiration hit us when: \"After hearing similar feedback hundreds of times in a row, we knew we were really onto something. The first four weeks of Techstars are designed to help you ensure that you're pointing in the right direction before spending the last eight weeks speeding forward.We spent our first four weeks talking to as many HR leaders and mentors as we could. We quickly realized that the biggest pain facing HR leaders (and their companies) today is developing their managers. In fact, every company we talked to said that they struggle to bring new managers up to speed, and that struggle ultimately leads to pain within the organization.\"VC, Angel or Bootstrap: \"Angels first, then VCs. We believe that great managers can be transformative to every organization. It's a big problem space that we're excited to solve, and solving it would mean building a big business, which would require VC backing.\"Our 'secret sauce' is: \"Our competitors in this space offer assessment without assistance or assistance without assessment. We show managers where they can improve based on employee feedback, use that feedback to drive personalized growth plans that help them level up, and then use feedback data to show real improvements.\"The smartest move we've made so far: \"Joining Techstars. It has been an amazing experience so far. The feedback from mentors and the pressure to execute have helped us challenge our assumptions and be more decisive in our approach.\"The biggest mistake we've made so far: \"A few months ago, we hired someone who wasn't a good culture fit. At the time, we discussed it as a team and decided we'd compromise on fit in order to benefit from this highly-skilled person's much-needed expertise. We quickly learned that it's better to work with people whose values align with yours, and ultimately decided to go our separate ways.\"Would you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: \"Zuckerberg. He has done an exceptional job of building a fast-growing behemoth without sacrificing a fair and engaging workplace culture.\"Our favorite team-building activity is: \"We have a tradition of sabering a bottle of champagne every time we hit a major milestone. We currently have 20 bottles by our pod waiting to be cracked open. Don't tell anyone.\"The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: \"Because we're still early and a lot is in flux we look for people who are comfortable with a high degree of ambiguity. Of course, we also look for people who align with our core values: craftsmanship, joy, openness, close the gap, and ownership.\"What's the one piece of advice you'd give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: \"You are the biggest cheerleader of your business.

    "content": "Ripl Chairman Andrew Wright and CEO Paul Ingalls.\nRipl is raising more cash as the company sees more traction with its app that lets people create visual marketing content.The Seattle startup has reeled in another $3 million from existing investors. Trilogy Equity Partners led the round, which pushes total funding to $7.5 million to date. Other backers include angel investors like Mike Galgon, Richard Fade, Geoff Entress, Rudy Gadre, Charles Fitzgerald, and others.Ripl's app lets small businesses -- restaurant owners, fitness instructors, real estate agents, etc. -- create visual content that they can use for social media marketing. It's a free app, but users can pay $9.99 per month to access premium features like additional designs, custom logos, music libraries, scheduled posts, and more.Since last year, the company's paying customer base has grown by 20X and it just passed 1 million installs of the app, with more than 250,000 active small business users on the platform. It is currently the fourth-highest grossing photo and video app in the App Store.Ripl CEO Paul Ingalls told GeekWire that the vision going forward is to not only provide a way for small business owners to create social media content, but to give them a \"marketing team in their pocket.\"\"We believe we can provide a platform that simply and skillfully reduces the complexity of marketing while keeping the price point at less than three lattes a month,\" he noted.Ingalls said he and his 15-person team are big believers in the impact entrepreneurship can have around the world, both from an economic and social standpoint. He sees Ripl as one way to reduce barriers of entry for small business owners and help them sustain their operations.\"By providing the skills of a marketing team to these entrepreneurs, we can help increase the success rates of their businesses,\" he said.Ripl COO Clay McDaniel said the company will add new features like personalized recommendations and new languages as it aims to give users a holistic marketing tool on their mobile devices.\"Our team fervently believes that entrepreneurship is going to be an engine of business growth over the next several decades on a global scale,\" McDaniel said. \"The mobile internet revolution enables control of your own economic destiny.\"Ripl went through a series of pivots before eventually landing on Ripl. Ingalls and Ripl Chairman Andrew Wright, who previously worked together at Redmond-based Smilebox and Seattle-based RealNetworks, originally tried to crack into the sports content business back in 2012 with an app called Fanzo. They quickly realized that Fanzo was not differentiated enough from other sports-related services and shifted to the first iteration of Ripl, which helped social media influencers leverage their online fanbase to make money.Ripl began to see some traction, but the app wasn't seeing enough user growth or monetization uptick. The startup decided to narrow its focus on one pillar of the app -- visual content creation -- and that's what ultimately led to what Ripl is today.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Study: Startup ecosystems across the country are bouncing back -- but there's more work to be done",
    "content": "Studies show entrepreneurship is on the rise. (Shutterstock Photo)\nThe Great Recession struck a major and lasting blow to entrepreneurship but the nation's startup ecosystem appears to finally be recovering.That's according to a new study from the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI), a moderate think tank and policy advocate, and TechNet, an advocacy group comprised of tech CEOs.The study (aimed at persuading local and federal governments to enact policy that promotes innovation) analyzed government data and job listings to determine the health of startups in the U.S. and the impact they have on job growth and the overall economy.Bureau of Labor statistics from 2015 to 2016 reveal that new establishments -- that is new startups or businesses that expand to new locations -- are finally increasing after years in a recession valley.\"The creation of new establishments finally accelerated in 2015 and 2016 -- not just in the leading tech hubs, but in smaller states and communities as well,\" writes PPI chief economist Michael Mandell. \"Overall, the number of private-sector establishments increased by 2.5 percent in the first three-quarters of 2016, the fastest rate of growth since before the Great Recession, and just below the 2.7 percent average rate of the 1990s.\"Researchers also studied the content of job listings on Indeed.com, to find out how frequently the word \"startup\" appeared. They claim the presence of the word -- even in listings from big companies that claim to operate like startups -- indicates a culture that values entrepreneurship. The presence of the word \"startup\" increased by 60 percent between 2014 to 2016, according to the study.PPI and TechNet are encouraged by these numbers because they see an increase in startup creation as a big driver of jobs.Mandell also notes that this growth isn't just taking place in coastal hubs like San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, and New York. Unsurprisingly, those tech centers dominated the study's top 10 list of metro areas where \"startup\" appeared most frequently in job listings.But Mandell says it's equally important to look at the regions lower on the top 25 list as up-and-coming centers of innovation and entrepreneurship.A 2016 Kauffman Index Report backs up the PPI's findings that startup ecosystems are bouncing back. The study also supports the theory that startup growth is spreading across the country, beyond traditional tech hubs. Washington D.C., Columbus, Ohio, Nashville, Tenn., and San Antonio, Texas, were all on the Kauffman Index's top 10 list of metros with the highest growth in entrepreneurship activity. The Kauffman study calls this phenomenon \"The Rise of the Rest.\"\"From Chicago to New Orleans, Nashville to Los Angeles, vibrant new companies are being formed that have the potential to become significant job creators -- particularly if nourished and supported by the right public policies,\" Mandell writes.Nudging the government toward those public policies is the impetus for the study. The PPI is imploring the federal government to reconsider rules governing crowdfunding and investing, to double down on STEM education and R&D, and to reform immigration policy to promote entrepreneurship.\"The recent acceleration of establishment growth suggests that [economic] dynamism may be slowly starting to revive -- but it is not enough,\" Mandell says.",

Rosedale previously built online virtual world Second Life; his new company is similar, but geared toward virtual reality. It raised an $11 million Series A round led by Vulcan Capital in February 2015 and reeled in another $22 million this past December.\"Our partnership with High Fidelity opens up the creation of VR interactive characters to far more people,\" Sanocki said. \"Now you don't need to be an game developer to build an interactive character -- a user can simply create one on High Fidelity by editing a text file, or if you're more technically inclined, you can extend it using JavaScript.\"High Fidelity users will be able to create characters that respond to voice, gestures, and other human social cues, similar to how Limitless' technology was used in this VR experience.\"VR worlds are made more alive and believable by emotional connections to characters within them.\" Philip Rosedale said in a statement. \"We want to give people the ability to easily create interactive characters, getting as close as possible to the magical experience of having other living people in the space with you.\"Sanocki said the partnership will \"give us a glimpse into the future of VR.\"\"High Fidelity's users are generally pro-sumers with basic technical knowledge, and range from educators to enthusiasts to professional animators,\" he said in a statement. \"Our integration within High Fidelity further validates that our storyteller-first approach to interactive characters is ready for widespread adoption.\"In October, Limitless rolled out its animated character development toolset for developers to leading film and animation studios.

    "title": "'Uber for car repair' startup Wrench raises $4M for service that brings a mechanic to your vehicle",
    "content": "Wrench says its mechanics serviced more than 1,000 cars during a test run this summer. (Via Wrench)\nInvestors like what they see in Wrench.The Seattle-based on-site car repair startup today announced a $4 million Series A round led by Madrona Venture Group, which previously co-led the company's $1.2 million seed round last year.Angel investors like super angel Rudy Gadre; TravelBank co-founder Ching-Ho Fung; former Dwellable CEO Kirby Winfield; Versium founder Kevin Marcus; and angel group Vashon Partners also participated.Wrench will use the fresh cash to hire mechanics, fuel marketing programs, and expand its presence on the west coast. The 1-year-old company currently operates in Seattle; Phoenix; San Diego; and Portland.Much like Uber brings you a ride and GrubHub brings you food, Wrench brings you a car mechanic. Using its website or smartphone app, customers can input work they need done on their vehicle and when and where they would like mechanics to go. Anything from an office parking lot to a downtown parking garage to a customer's driveway is fair game, though Wrench will not work on cars parked on the street for safety reasons.A certified mechanic with at least five years of experience will perform work at a customer's home or office, with upfront fixed price quotes. Wrench says it can do more than 80 percent of all car repair and maintenance work that can be done outside of a shop.Much like Uber or Lyft, tips aren't required. Examples of jobs include replacing brake pads; fixing an ignition problem; diagnosing exhaust issues; and more.The company initially limited its services to oil changes, tune-ups and basic brake repair, but high demand led Wrench to expand services to cover almost anything that a shop or dealership would provide.\"Wrench continues to invest in its technology, which provides a huge advantage in this industry, and the hiring of the highest quality mechanics,\" Wrench CEO Ed Petersen told GeekWire.Wrench, which employs 30 people, will also add new services for customers and ink more partnerships to bolster its on-demand marketplace. Total funding to date is $5.3 million.Wrench said it saves people an average of 2.4 hours of travel and wait time; it also claims to be as much as 30 percent less expensive than car dealership service bays, while its prices are on par with independent car repair shops. Its service is backed by a 1-year, 12,000 mile guarantee on both parts and labor.Peterson has been working with the same team for more than a decade. He and some his current colleagues founded and sold Intelius, a public record search company, and TalentWise, which does background checks and other screening services.The car repair industry is pegged at around $60 billion. There are other companies like Wrench -- namely, Your Mechanic, which just raised $24 million earlier this month. And then there's Fiix, which just launched out of Y Combinator.\"U.S. consumers spend more than $60 billion annually on car repairs and maintenance and the service model hasn't changed meaningfully since the invention of the oil change shop,\" Madrona Managing Director Len Jordan said in a statement. \"Wrench applies modern mobile, internet commerce and data analytics techniques to this market and delivers a physical service that consumers need multiple times a year.\"",

    "content": "Steven Koltai speaks at InBIA in Seattle on Monday. (GeekWire photo)\nCan entrepreneurship promote political stability and peace in countries around the world? Steven Koltai certainly believes so.The long-time startup junkie, who was most recently a senior advisor for entrepreneurship at the U.S. Department of State under former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, spoke at the 31st International Conference on Business Incubation hosted by InBIA, a global network of entrepreneurs, in Seattle on Monday.After launching two companies and working as an investment banker, management consultant, and media industry executive, Koltai took a job with the U.S. government under Clinton in 2009 and helped create the Global Entrepreneurship Program, which focused on job creation via entrepreneurship in Muslim-majority countries.Koltai, who now runs his own consulting company, rehashed some of the main takeaways from his book, Peace through Entrepreneurship.\"I wrote this book based on one simple premise: joblessness is the single biggest cause of political unrest and violence in the world,\" Koltai said. \"And the single best way to create jobs is through entrepreneurship. There is a straight line connection between entrepreneurship, jobs, political stability, and peace.\"Koltai is focused on how the U.S. can help spur entrepreneurship in developing countries, many of which do not have the resources or cultural norms that help promote startup creation.Unsurprisingly, many people ask him why the U.S. should be involved in job creation abroad, rather than doing the same at home.He said this type of outreach directly impacts the U.S. itself -- particularly with security. Koltai noted how \"all of the wars since World War II, we have lost.\"\"We probably should have learned that traditional warfare is not making us safer; it is not making the world more peaceful,\" he explained. \"So maybe we could take a tiny, tiny, tiny portion of what we spend on what is by far the the largest discretionary spending area of government, and spend it on an alternative method of security creation, which is job creation.\"Koltai provided evidence of how joblessness in different countries going through crisis creates unrest -- that in turn can threaten international security, he said.\"Huge rates of unemployment generally drives people, especially young people, to desperation,\" Koltai said.He also showed how countries that invest and encourage entrepreneurship can create wealth much faster than those who do not, both on an individual basis and on a national economy basis. For example, Singapore and Jamaica shared many similarities in 1965 -- island countries, British colonies, similar populations, same per-capita income, etc.But fast forward to today and Jamaica is one of the poorest countries in the world while Singapore is one of the wealthiest.\"Part of the driver of that wealth was a focus on entrepreneurship and improving the business climate that existed in Singapore,\" Koltai said. \"From a purely economic standpoint, it was transformative.\"Koltai hopes that the U.S. will spend more of its foreign aid budgets on entrepreneurship promotion. He said the U.S. spends less than countries like Canada, Sweden, and The Netherlands in absolute dollars.\"Not only do we spend very little, but we spend it very badly,\" he added.So how do cities and countries promote entrepreneurship? Koltai developed a \"Six + Six Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Model,\" which highlights the six actions he believes is required to create more jobs and companies (click to enlarge):\"We believe that only through this comprehensive, holistic approach can true progress toward a healthy entrepreneurial ecosystem be achieved,\" Koltai writes on his site.",

    "content": "MetaJure founder Marty Smith believes the company's software can help legal aid providers be more efficient. (MetaJure Photo)\nMany tech companies wait until they grow into big corporations before thinking about corporate social responsibility. But MetaJure, a Seattle startup that provides software to help lawyers manage their documents and email, is starting early.As early as the company's Series A funding round, in fact. MetaJure is using its $2.6 million round as an opportunity for what its founder and director Marty Smith calls \"social investing.\" For every dollar MetaJure raises, the equivalent value (in the form of the company's product) will go toward legal aid providers around the country.\"A 'social investment' is any investment that seeks to produce a financial return to the investor while also producing a social good. Usually, the social good is produced as the company grows, as might be the case by investing in an alternative energy company wherein over time, carbon dioxide emissions are increasingly reduced. We felt, however, a strong sense of urgency to make an immediate difference so we decided to bring an 'impact investing' component into play as well, namely where a person's financial investment causes an immediate social impact.\"The program led to the installation of MetaJure's technology at Georgia Legal Services, Pine Tree Legal Assistance in Maine, Colorado Legal Services, and Legal Aid Society of Orange County. MetaJure also plans to equip Arkansas Legal Services, Utah Legal Services, and the Northwest Justice Project, in Washington, with its product in the next few weeks.In addition to the software, MetaJure provided installation and support training. MetaJure also agreed to continue licensing the software to the legal aid providers as long as they continue using it.MetaJure always planned to give back through philanthropy once the business was fleshed out and profitable but the company's leadership saw a more immediate need that couldn't wait.\"Recent political events have compounded the problem by increasing the need for legal advice on hate crimes and immigration,\" Smith said. \"At the same time, President Trump's proposed budget eliminates all funding for the Legal Services Corporation, the primary source of financial support for legal aid throughout the country.\"When MetaJure's series A closes, the company will look at other ways to support legal aid providers. One option under consideration is donating the software on a law firm's or legal department's behalf in an amount equal to their purchase.The company has raised about $7 million to date. Beyond supporting legal aid, MetaJure plans to use the fresh cash to bolster its sales efforts.\"MetaJure's board believes access to justice is a foundational pillar of our democracy,\" Smith said. \"Not surprisingly, we felt a strong desire to see what we could do to make a difference today.\"",

(GeekWire photo)\nYou'd be hard pressed to find a bigger believer in the value of startups than John Harthorne.The MassChallenge CEO gave the opening keynote at the 31st International Conference on Business Incubation hosted by InBIA, a global network of entrepreneurs, in Seattle on Monday.In 2009, Harthorne helped launch MassChallenge, a global non-profit organization that runs five accelerators around the world which are unique because they don't take equity from startups. More than 1,200 companies from a wide variety of industries -- alumni include Tellus Labs; Adhesys Medical; TapLink; and others -- have gone through the program and went on to collectively raise $1.8 billion in funding while creating 60,000 jobs.Before starting Boston-based MassChallenge, Harthorne worked in a variety of industries before landing a consulting gig at Bain & Company. It was then when he realized that the \"system\" was too selfish and greedy -- \"everyone was fighting over slices of pie and there weren't enough people making pie,\" he noted. Harthorne and his co-founder Akhil Nigam thought there needed to be an easier way for people to launch businesses.\"Entrepreneurs are the salvation of humanity,\" Harthorne told the crowd. \"These are the value creators, the pie creators. They not only create a business, but many times, an entire industry.\"MassChallenge, which is funded largely from corporate sponsors like Microsoft and GE who get access to its startups, aims to remove friction from the startup creation process, placing the companies at the center of an innovation ecosystem that also includes government, investors, universities, media, foundations, and more.\"The goal is to organize everybody and create a model that engages all of them,\" Harthorne explained. \"It's like if you make a cake, you can't just say, let's put more eggs and get more cake out. The recipe has to be balanced. You need all these players to do more stuff and include them. And the realization is that all of them benefit from a startup.\"Its accelerators -- in Boston, London, Switzerland, Israel, and Mexico, with seven others launching by 2020 -- offer access to mentorship, office space, and a chance to win part of $3 million in equity-free cash awards.\"Our model, goal, and mission is to create a factory for startups,\" Harthorne explained. \"We're trying to create thousands of startups globally to try and change the way people interact with the economy, to be more creative and focused on adding value.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",

McDonald spent more than two years and $2 million on professional fees trying to figure out where the money went.\"When he started, you couldn't trust the books and accounting systems or financial statements, so Tod had to go to the source of all monetary inflow and outflow bank activity to get conclusive answers,\" said Valid8 CEO Chris McCall.They knew there had to be a better way.

The tools are designed to simplify the process for auditors, lenders, and other professionals who need to make objective decisions based on bank statements and financial records.\"When we recognized the value of applying a high level of scrutiny and understanding up front before bad things happen, Valid8 was born,\" McCall said.The two-year-old startup is currently working through the Techstars Seattle accelerator.

    "content": "Atlas Informatics CEO Jordan Ritter. Photo via Atlas.\nAtlas Informatics has cut nearly a third of its staff.Atlas CEO Jordan Ritter, who was previously a co-founder of Napster, confirmed the layoffs in an email to GeekWire on Monday. The Seattle-based startup now employs 23 people, down from 34 this past November when it raised a $20.7 million investment round.The company's software acts as a personal search engine, running in the background on users' computers to capture an encrypted record of their activity across different apps and services. The idea is to help users quickly locate information within files, emails, and other personal data.Atlas came out of stealth mode in November 2015 as the first company spun out of Seattle startup innovation studio Ivy Softworks, also started by Ritter. The idea for Ivy Softworks was to create an \"innovation studio\" -- not an accelerator or incubator -- that keeps the same employees together to work on product after product.As Ritter explained to GeekWire in 2014, in his view, it was inefficient to spend time recruiting a whole new set of A-team players or finding new office space every time a new business idea emerges.When Atlas first spun out of Ivy Softworks, all of the employees from Ivy Softworks shifted to work for Atlas. Last year, Ritter said that Softworks \"has been put on pause for now, but the business continues to exist.\"Now, Ritter says its \"full focus is on Atlas.\" Here is his statement.As you know, we've been in a transition from a product-oriented innovation studio to a lean, business-focused startup. To complete the transition we let go 10 of our valued colleagues, whose dedication and efforts I'm tremendously thankful for. Our recruiter is working with them to find their next role, many of whom will be securing opportunities in the next week. Our full focus is on Atlas, which we launched in open beta into November, and we have since received a strong reception from users, media and the market. This positive feedback has validated our approach to personal search, and accelerated our development of contextual suggestions, a new kind of technology that intelligently suggests what you need in the moment and proactively organizes your digital life for you.A web archive from January shows 11 employees who are no longer listed on Atlas' \"about\" page, including several engineers and a product designer who had been at Atlas for more than three years. The company has no open positions on its jobs page.This past November, Atlas raised $20.7 million from Microsoft, Aspect Ventures, and Nathan Myhrvold, the Intellectual Ventures co-founder and former Microsoft CTO. Microsoft invested on behalf of the company itself, not its Microsoft Ventures arm.At the time, Atlas also released its first product, Atlas Recall, in open beta for Mac users, along with an iOS companion app. The company is also working on a Windows 10 version of the product.",

Nelson also happens to be pregnant.\"I heard, again and again, various themes from leading angel investors or more seasoned entrepreneurs on how we wouldn't be able to raise it if I told people this fact or failed to hide my pregnancy,\" she said.She considered their advice, then decided to toss it out the window. Nelson and Peltola are launching The Riveter to challenge bias just like this. Their vision is a co-working space where women don't feel excluded from the business world because of their gender.\"I thought about what we are building and why,\" she said. \"We want to change the game for women founders and freelancers and if I'm truly going to walk the walk, part of that is being honest about who I am and where I am in my life. So, I told our investors and potential investors. Although morning pitches have been a little bit hard because of morning sickness, I've found absolutely no resistance to funding a pregnant founder.\"The Riveter has raised $565,000 of a $600,000 seed round to open a flagship facility in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. A soft launch is planned for mid-April and The Riveter will officially open its doors May 1. The space will have nine offices, room for 120 collaborative desks, a fitness studio, meditation room, retail space, and other amenities. Daily yoga classes, wellness seminars, and community events are key to Nelson and Peltola's vision.The duo met a few years ago when they were both new to Seattle and new to motherhood. They came from different backgrounds (Peltola was a social worker) but faced similar challenges related to juggling careers and parenting.\"Two topics kept coming up for both of us over the years: how do you do it all thousands of miles from family and what do you do when you want to 'off-ramp' from the full-time career but 'on-ramp' into something different?\"They started kicking around the idea of going into business together and checked out a few local coworking facilities.\"We kept running into spaces built by and for men -- foosball, ping pong, and beer kegs,\" Nelson said. \"As professional women in our 30's, we weren't finding any community, and certainly couldn't find the programming we wanted to help with business skills or a place where we could focus on wellness.\"These \"bro-working\" spaces, as Nelson describes them, inspired the co-founders to build a female-focused collaboration center where they would be happy working every day. Then they started thinking bigger.This fall, The Riveter will open a second location in Bellevue, Wash. From there, the company will raise a second investment round of $3 to $4 million. The Riveter is planning to use those funds to open up an additional 19 locations along the West Coast by 2021.Although the space is designed as a haven for female founders and freelancers, men are also welcome there. The Riveter has taken on male employees and encourages its members to bring diverse teams into the facility.The Riveter will sell monthly memberships for $375 and up, $30 day passes, and hourly drop-in passes that cost $75 for 10 hours. The Riveter will also offer community memberships for women who don't need office space but wish to attend events.\"Women want more community, more interaction, more events ... and that's what we're doing,\" said Nelson. \"We're creating amazing programming to bring our community together, feature women entrepreneurs, and help women get over the pain points in building their own businesses.\"",

Its first product is a credit card updater for online accounts, giving customers an efficient way of keeping their payment methods up-to-date, along with better visibility of their cards.The idea is to help people easily update online payment information on various websites when replacing a credit card that was lost, stolen, or expired. This can be a frustrating and time-consuming process that is becoming more common with the increasing number of online services people are using on a daily basis that requires credit card information, from Amazon.com to Uber to Spotify to Netflix.Switch just launched early access to its free service last month.\"Today, credit and debit cards are the dominant payment solutions for consumers,\" Switch CEO Chris Hopen said in a statement. \"Switch is the first ever consumer payment solution that automates both the challenge of secure account access and the 'card on file' problems users face every day.\"Switch also offers end-to-end encryption, two-factor authentication, and additional features as part of its security offerings.Hopen founded Switch with former colleague David Pool.

    "title": "Search fund founders discover 'best kept secret' for women who want to become entrepreneurs",
    "content": "After nearly a decade of friendship, Martinique Grigg, left and Clara Veniard launched search fund Grant Peak Capital. (GeekWire Photo / Monica Nickelsburg)\nThe visibility of International Women's Day and the Women's March movement has the tech community asking a familiar question: Why aren't there more female entrepreneurs?The answer is complicated. Women often identify as more risk-averse than men, they can face higher expectations for domestic work, and they typically earn less than men, making it more likely that they will be the partner to leave the workforce when children come into the mix.It's a tough problem, but two Seattle women, who have balanced high-powered careers and parenthood, may have found a solution.Clara Veniard and Martinique Grigg, two former Amazon employees who have held a variety of leadership roles, are joining forces to launch a new search fund, Grant Peak Capital. They believe a search fund -- a vehicle for people with business experience to raise capital and acquire one or more small companies -- is a great way for women to take the entrepreneurial plunge.\"I think this is a common situation for women of our age,\" Grigg said. \"We've amassed this experience, we may have other priorities in our life, and we're looking for a way to have some more control and really take advantage of the experience that we've earned over the years and ... reap the rewards of that hard work by having an ownership position in the company. That was really appealing to me.\"Their search fund is named for a peak on Washington's Mount Baker where Grigg and Veniard finally met after years of walking remarkably similar paths. Both women attended Dartmouth College for undergrad and Harvard Business School without ever meeting. They moved to Seattle independently and random chance brought them together on Mount Baker. Veniard recognized Grigg's husband, a fellow Dartmouth alumni, and the rest was history.\"She worked at the Gates Foundation and then went on to work at Amazon for six years and I had worked at Amazon,\" Grigg told GeekWire. \"You keep following me!\"\"You set the path. I shall follow,\" Veniard teased.A little over a year ago, when Veniard was on maternity leave from Amazon, she approached Grigg with the idea for Grant Peak. Grigg, just coming off a six-year stint as CEO of The Mountaineers, was excited about the opportunity.Since then, the duo has been actively searching for the right company. They're focused on Pacific Northwest businesses with a valuation between $5 million and $20 million. So far they've been looking at companies in consumer goods, business software, and software as a service. They're planning to contribute a substantial amount of personal equity, supplemented with investments of around $100,000 each from up to 20 \"soft-pledged\" backers.\"Frankly, we feel a little oversubscribed in terms of interest,\" Veniard said.Veniard and Grigg are a bit unique as female founders of a search fund with extensive leadership experience. They feel like that's an advantage both for raising capital and closing an acquisition deal.\"There are some questions around why more women don't do this, don't seek to buy small businesses and one hypothesis is, people typically want to sell a business to people that look like them,\" Veniard said.But women own 28 percent of all businesses nationwide, according to census data. That number appears to be growing, especially among small businesses in the U.S.\"So we have time and time again come across businesses that are owned by women that are so excited to meet women that are going to buy their business, that they feel like are going to understand how they approach their business, understand the culture of their company, that just look like them,\" Veniard said. \"So they are much more willing to do a deal with us, versus someone who might have a slightly better offer but it's an all-male team and they just don't have that same camaraderie with.\"Grant Peak's founders hope their story can inspire other women to take ownership and leadership roles in small businesses.\"This is like the best-kept secret out there,\" Grigg said. \"And guys are doing this all the time!\"",

    "content": "John Kueber. (uZoom Photo)\nuZoom is raising more cash as it builds out its 1-to-1 live video streaming platform and expands into e-commerce.The Seattle startup has reeled in an additional $1.5 million from Broadmark Capital and angel investors.uZoom, which raised a $560,000 seed round last year, launched this past June with its marketplace for live streaming video, connecting people who want to see something in the world with those on the ground that are actually there.For example, during last year's Summer Olympics, uZoom provided a way for people to use their smartphones to live-stream from a bevy of locations -- swimming competitions, late night festivities, beaches, etc. -- and give viewers from around the world an alternate method to see what was going on in Brazil.The idea is that people will pay a nominal fee to see something streamed live by a \"Zoomer,\" with uZoom providing the platform to make it happen.\"Whether you're curious about what it's like to go out to dinner in Japan or you'd like a first-hand look at an elk hunt in Montana, uZoom is a platform full of new experiences and opportunities through live streaming,\" the site reads.Some of the top categories on uZoom include \"street tours,\" \"neighborhood advice,\" \"current events,\" \"local sports,\" and more.Originally founded by digital media vet Martin Rincon, uZoom tapped Dean Graziano as its CEO last year. This past November, Graziano stepped down and was replaced by digital media veteran John Kueber, who was previously at Jrrny.com.Kueber told GeekWire that uZoom continues to raise more money that will be used to fund its consumer platform as well as \"another initiative related to shopping/e-commerce that will be announced in the coming weeks.\"Here's a shopping-related video the company recently posted that may signal what's in store:uZoom employs eight people and has raised $2 million to date.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
