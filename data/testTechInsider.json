In a new report on job creation, Apple has broken out how many jobs it's helped create that are \"attributable to the App Store ecosystem\" -- so, app makers. Apple says that out of the 2 million jobs its created nationwide, more than 1.5 million are related to building apps. As part of the report, Apple picked three apps that were built in each state. While some are hyperlocal, like an Oklahoma-centric weather app or a regional bank in West Virginia, others have millions of users each day.

    "title": "The go-to headphone brand for DJs just came out with a great Bluetooth pair",
    "content": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.AmazonV-MODA is best known for being one of the go-to headphone brands for DJs. The company sent me a pair of its newest model, the Crossfade 2, and it's clear why it earned that distinction. From their physical design to their sound profile, these headphones are meant to make you look and feel cool.It's worth touching on the design of these headphones, because it's clear V-MODA put a lot of thought into it. Instead of circular ear cups, V-MODA's are diamond shaped, which makes them look more distinct. The combination of black leather and hard plastic looks sleek. But V-MODA didn't sacrifice comfort for aesthetics; these headphones are smaller than most over-ear headphones I've tried, but they still have enough padding to be comfortable. I mentioned V-MODA's association with the DJ industry earlier, and it's instantly apparent why once you start listening to music. Both high and low frequencies are boosted, which doesn't mean music sounds bad, but it does sound a little artificial. Anyone who has spent time at a nightclub or concert is familiar with the sound of PA speakers. That same type of sound is captured in these headphones. Listening to pop music -- the genre these headphones were made for -- was a fun experience. I felt like I was in a club, which was the whole point. Folk, rock, country, and acoustic music also sounded very good, but it was clear where these headphones excelled.Live music also sounded excellent, and listening to live tracks made me feel like I was hearing what I would have heard at the show itself.How much value you'll get out of these headphones really does depend on your musical genres of choice. As I said earlier, V-MODA did a good job making headphones that sound very good for all music, but great for specific genres. If you care about aesthetics and love to listen to upbeat pop music, V-MODA's Crossfade 2s can turn your commute into a late-night out. People looking for a more general pair of Bluetooth headphones might find a better option elsewhere.If you want to see more from Insider Picks, we're collecting emails for an upcoming newsletter.

Here's what to do.Following is a transcript of the video:Reaction time and speed are key for survival. A sinking car will not immediately submerge, which means there's a small window of opportunity to act.Don't try to open the door. Water pressure makes this extremely difficult to do. And even if you could open the door, this would allow more water to come in and make y our car sink faster. Instead, quickly roll down your side window, unbuckle yourself, and climb out. If you were too slow to react, the water pressure could pin your doors and windows shut. That means you'll have to break a window. Don't try the car's front windshield as it's built to resist impacts. Instead, go for the side windows. Use your foot and kick at the top of the window or remove the headrest from your seat and jam it where the window meets the door.You can also use a glass breaking tool like ResQMe to quickly break the window. It can easily be stored in the glove compartment or on your keychain. If the car is upside down and your seatbelt is locking you in, the tool can even cut you free.After breaking the window, immediately take a deep breath of air and swim out through the rushing water toward safety.

To learn more and subscribe, please click here.US pay-TV businesses lost 762,000 subscribers in Q1 2017, the worst subscriber loss in the first quarter ever, according to MoffettNathanson estimates.The data point also represents the worst ever annual growth rate, with customers shrinking by 2.4% year-over-year (YoY), and that rate of decline has been accelerating for the past two quarters. There's no question that consumers are starting to cut the cord at the fastest pace ever, and pay-TV companies can no longer downplay the threat new streaming services pose to their business models. Here are a few more takeaways from the report:Lackluster demand is not the driver -- it's increasing supply of high-quality over-the-top streaming alternatives. Consumers have more options than ever before when it comes to watching video and TV, from Hulu Live and YouTube TV to Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, and it seems as though this is just the beginning of a mass exodus from traditional TV offerings.Over the last few years, there's been much talk about the \"death of TV.\" However, television is not dying so much as it's evolving: extending beyond the traditional television screen and broadening to include programming from new sources accessed in new ways.It's strikingly evident that more consumers are shifting their media time away from live TV, while opting for services that allow them to watch what they want, when they want. Indeed, we are seeing a migration toward original digital video such as YouTube Originals, SVOD services such as Netflix, and live streaming on social platforms.However, not all is lost for legacy media companies. Amid this rapidly shifting TV landscape, traditional media companies are making moves across a number of different fronts -- trying out new distribution channels, creating new types of programming aimed at a mobile-first audience, and partnering with innovate digital media companies. In addition, cable providers have begun offering alternatives for consumers who may no longer be willing to pay for a full TV package.Dylan Mortensen, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, has compiled a detailed report on the future of TV that looks at how TV viewer, subscriber, and advertising trends are shifting, and where and what audiences are watching as they turn away from traditional TV.

    "title": "Millennials are still most likely to share content on Facebook",
    "content": "Facebook may have lost some of its cool factor over the years as newer networks like Instagram and Snapchat gained widespread fanfare -- but it's still the number one destination for sharing content among millennials. In fact, over half of millennials say Facebook is where they're most likely to share content, according to BI Intelligence's 2017 Digital Trust survey, head and shoulders above any other social platform. The fraction of users who fall into the demographic is relatively consistent across social platforms, except for Snapchat, which skews heavily toward millennials.Millennials are also more likely to share on Facebook than Gen Xers and baby boomers -- knocking down a common argument that Facebook is for \"old people.\" Younger users are typically the driving force behind a social platform's popularity in the early stages, and incumbents can easily lose their attention when a new one pops up. As a result, mature platforms must fight to keep hold of this demographic, which is highly coveted by marketers. Facebook winning this battle speaks to its ability to keep millennials engaged even as they are wooed by younger platforms like Snapchat.BI IntelligenceWhile Snapchat is a teenage and millennial hotbed, it's for ephemeral messaging between close friends, not for sharing other content found online. A whopping 63% of Snapchat's daily active users fall into the millennial demographic, and another 22% are teens aged 13-17 -- but they're not sending posts or links to articles. Snapchat users create their own content, or \"Stories,\" meaning the platform is populated with content that's largely user-generated. Brands should utilize Snapchat for the authentic interactions of its users, but Facebook is better suited for casual sharing at scale.For brands and advertisers, getting people to share content can help spread their marketing message more organically than ad targeting. This underlines the importance of native advertising, and the potential in targeting millennials on Facebook with relevant content they are willing to share. Devoting more native ad spend to Facebook can also help make ads on the platform less annoying, while encouraging greater engagement.Moreover, Facebook's sheer size means brand messaging has the potential to go viral. While this could prompt some brands to do some serious damage control if the message is ill-conceived, positive content that is shared and trending on Facebook can benefit them tremendously. Facebook's massive scale is second to none, and if brands can successfully make a message go viral, they may enjoy lower advertising costs, mainstream media exposure, and faster lead generation.Click here to sign up for more BI Intelligence content like thisBI Intelligence's Digital Trust survey examines consumers' perception of major social platforms.

    "content": "Benjamin Zhang/Business InsiderIn 2016, Honda unleashed its new 10th-generation Civic sedan to rave reviews -- even taking home the crown as the 2016 North American Car of the Year. It was a refreshing return to form for the Civic after the steady-selling, but critically panned, ninth-generation model.Last year, Honda sold nearly 367,000 10th-gen Civics in the US -- making it the second-best-selling car in the country. And for good reason: It's comfortable, roomy, loaded with tech, and incredibly fuel efficient. In fact, a few of my friends were among those who bought new Civics last year and are head over heels in love with them.But I, for one, was never truly smitten with the new model. Perhaps it's the lackadaisical continuously variable transmission that muffles any and all dynamism from the driving experience or the infuriatingly ill-conceived infotainment system or even the oddly proportioned rear-end styling.You see, when it comes to Civics, I'm a traditionalist. That means I'm partial to one with a peppy four-cylinder engine, a lively transmission, and nimble driving dynamics wrapped up in a user-friendly package.Recently, Honda dropped off the latest variant of its hot-selling compact -- the Civic Sport -- for Business Insider to check out.Our Civic Sport came with no optional extras, which meant the $22,135 base price is also our as-tested price.Here's how it fared.",

    "title": "Hackers used a long-neglected vulnerability in phone networks to empty victims' bank accounts",
    "content": "Jason Baker/Wikimedia Commons (CC) There's a major vulnerability in the way phone networks talk to each other -- and hackers have used it to drain victims' bank accounts. What's more: The issue has been known about for years, and public demonstrations have highlighted the issue, but nothing had been done about it. A number of German customers of telecom network O2-Telefonica were stolen from using the \"SS7\" vulnerability, according a report from German-language newspapers Suddeutsche Zeitung. (We first heard about it via The Register.) So what's the issue, and how does it work? Signal System No. 7, or SS7, is how phone networks talk to each other, ensuring customers don't lose service, and is used all over the world. But you can also use it to spy on people -- reading their messages, tracking where they go, and redirecting calls. So if an attacker gets access to the SS7 network, they can do real damage. That's exactly what happened in Germany. It's not not clear who the attackers were, or how they obtained their access (though SZ said it could be had for \"just under EUR1,000\"), but the report does detail how they hit their targets. First, the victims were targeted with phishing emails that tricked them into giving up their logins and passwords to their online banking accounts. But this wasn't enough to steal money from their accounts, because the Germans had a form of two-factor authentication activated. This meant the bank texted them before each money transfer to seek approval -- theoretically preventing hackers from stealing cash even if a victim's login details are compromised. Now this is where the SS7 attack comes in. Over the \"past months,\" the attackers reportedly logged into the victims' accounts, tried to transfer funds, then redirected the two-factor text messages to themselves. They confirmed the transfers, drained the accounts, and the victims couldn't do anything about it. You phone's security is bro Ben Carleton/Flickr (CC) Issues with SS7 have been known for years. In 2014, researchers demonstrated how it can be used to track people and intercept their communications. And in 2016, US congressman Ted Lieu was (with his consent) hacked as part of a demonstration of SS7's flaws for CBS. But the issue continues today, and can theoretically be used to eavesdrop on calls, track people via their phones, and intercept text messages. And criminals are awake to the possibilities -- as the German incident starkly illustrates. Ted Lieu has put out a sharply worded statement about the news, warning: \"Everyone's accounts protected by text-based two-factor authentication, such as bank accounts, are potentially at risk until the FCC [Federal Communications Commission, a US government agency] and telecom industry fix the devastating SS7 security flaw. Both the FCC and telecom industry have been aware that hackers can acquire our text messages and phone conversations just knowing our cell phone number. It is unacceptable the FCC and telecom industry have not acted sooner to protect our privacy and financial security. I urge the Republican-controlled Congress to hold immediate hearings on this issue.\"",

    "title": "A leaked document shows exactly how the government wants to spy on emails, calls, and messages",
    "content": "Home Secretary Amber Rudd. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth The UK government is trying to give itself more power to spy on your phone calls, emails, and messages. That's according to a technical paper written by the Home Office and leaked to the Open Rights Group, and first reported by The Register. You can read the full document below -- but be warned, there's lots of legal jargon. The paper is a draft, meaning the government has sent it out to relevant companies like mobile and internet providers and is asking for feedback. But a law called the Investigatory Powers Act means it can do all of this secretly -- so if it hadn't been for one of those companies leaking the draft paper to Open Rights Group, you would never have known about it. The draft paper gives us a lot of insight into the kind of extensive spying powers the Home Office would like. Here's the summary: ORG According to the new regulations, if the government asks an internet provider or mobile company for information about you, that company must hand it over in one working day. The government would need a warrant, and the information might include actually listening in on your calls, reading your messages, plus \"secondary data\" like the times you make calls and your phone number. Once the government has issued a warrant asking for someone's information, it really wants that information in near real-time. ORG The Home Office doesn't say in the technical paper why it wants all these powers, but it's easy enough to guess from recent news stories. In the case of real-time information, take Home Secretary Amber Rudd criticising WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption, which means the government can't read messages. Khalid Masood, the terrorist who attacked Westminster in March, used WhatsApp shortly before launching his attack.The Telegraph reported that security services did eventually gain access to his WhatsApp messages and dismissed them as unimportant. So clearly end-to-end encryption wasn't a total barrier. But according to the public timeline of events, it seems to have taken about a month. That's why access to near real-time communications matters. ORG Another requirement is that companies remove \"electronic protection\" when it comes to handing over data. Translated, that probably means inserting a backdoor of some kind. Again, the government doesn't state how this might work. It also doesn't seem to understand that compromising encryption makes innocent people more vulnerable to hackers as well. The government also said it wants companies to consider spying demands whenever they build new products. You probably already know that communications companies have equipment designed for mass government spying, it's just that no one really likes to talk about it. US provider AT&T famously had a secret room where the NSA, the US spying agency, had installed equipment. The UK government wants companies to keep equivalent spying equipment up-to-date, but the paper doesn't go into much detail about what that kit might look like. ORG The second part of the draft paper deals with spying on your post. The government wants any \"UK licensed postal operator,\" like the Royal Mail, to open, copy, and reseal post without the recipient knowing about it. This might even apply to companies like Amazon. Ofcom, the body which licenses postal operators, has not immediately responded to a request for clarification. Jim Killock, director of the Open Rights Group, said in a statement that the government might try and force companies like WhatsApp to \"limit their encryption\" -- all in secret. \"The public has a right to know about government powers that could put their privacy and security at risk,\" he said. \"There needs to be transparency about how such measures are judged to be reasonable, the risks that are imposed on users and companies, and how companies can challenge government demands that are unreasonable.\" Because this is a consultation, companies could still challenge some of the proposals in this paper. But as the Open Rights Group said, there isn't a \"clear route of appeal\". Here's the full nine-page document:",

Snapchat is opening itself up to advertisers of all sizes with new buying tools. The move could help considerably grow Snap's fledgling ad business, which is expected to reach $1 billion (PS774 million) in revenue this year. 6. Amazon is expanding its presence in Cambridge with a new R&D lab for 400 staff. When the new lab opens, Amazon's existing research and development facility in the city will be used exclusively for Prime Air, which is Amazon's delivery drone initiative. 7.

    "title": "Why the iPhone is losing ground in China",
    "content": "South China Morning Post Cheap \"me-too\" smartphones are no longer the only thing Apple can blame for iPhone's falling sales in China as the country's most successful manufacturers are quietly gaining ground in the premium market as well. Apple, which has long dominated China's top 10 bestselling high-end smartphone list, saw the most number of Chinese rivals break into the category priced over 4,000 yuan (US$579.9) in the quarter ended in March, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research. Apple still occupies five spots in the top 10 list with its iPhone 7 Plus 128G being the top seller among all premium smartphones in China, the world largest smartphone market. However, four Chinese models - three from Huawei Technologies and one by Vivo - have made it into the list with one spot left for Samsung Electronics. \"The top 10 premium phone list was practically a duopoly by Apple and Samsung until Huawei became the first Chinese game changer in the high-end crowd about one year ago. The first quarter of 2017 is the first time that we see Vivo get into the list,\" said James Yan, Beijing-based research director of Counterpoint Technology. Chinese smartphone brands have been tightening their grip in China, grabbing local market share and squeezing out Apple and Samsung by producing cheaper phones with not so cheap features. But an increasing number of them, such as Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, have started to take the high-end market seriously as competing aggressively for razor-thin margins in the low-end market is no longer in their best interest. Research from IDC shows the average selling price of Android phones in China continued to rise in the first quarter of 2017 largely due to the increasing desire of consumers for key flagship models made by Huawei, Oppo and Vivo - China's top three smartphone makers in terms of shipments for the quarter ended March. South China Morning Post \"Consumers are seeking to upgrade their smartphones to seek a better user experience and these companies offer models that can meet their demand,\" said IDC in a research note released on Thursday. IDC also said the key flagship models released by these Chinese companies have more upgraded specifications such as dual cameras and OLED screens that have driven up average selling prices. Apple, which reported on Wednesday its fifth consecutive quarter of revenue decline for its greater China business, has seen a double-digit fall in iPhone's first-quarter sales in China, which was a major source of growth before last year. Data from IDC showed that it ranked fourth in the China market in the first quarter with 9.2 per cent market share compared with 11 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016. \"But we believe that Chinese consumers are holding out for the launch of Apple's 10-year anniversary iPhone at the end of the year, and this will help Apple to see a rebound in the China smartphone market,\" said Tay Xiaohan, a senior market analyst with IDC Asia-Pacific.

    "title": "Fox hit with harassment lawsuit alleging host was fired after calling internal hotline",
    "content": "A woman walks by a sign showing Fox News Channel TV anchor Bill O'Reilly outside the News Corporation headquarters in New York City. Thomson Reuters A Fox News employee on Thursday sued 21st Century Fox, alleging she was fired after reporting instances of sexual harassment to the anonymous company hotline. In the lawsuit, attorneys from Wigdor Law said that Fox News Radio correspondent Jessica Golloher was \"marginalized and subject to discrimination\" based on her gender. The suit alleged she was fired after attempting to contact the network's harassment hotline, a resource that has been touted by the company following a spate of recent harassment allegations. Golloher's lawsuit named Fox News, 21st Century Fox, and Fox News Radio Vice President Mitch Davis and Director of Programming Hank Weinbloom as defendants in the case. The Fox Radio correspondent claimed in the lawsuit that she was downgraded to \"secretarial\" status and forced to cover frivolous issues like the \"panty protest\" during the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Further, the lawsuit alleged that Davis told Golloher to send him photos of her reporting for a piece, but said that photos she sent him were \"horrible\" and that she was \"much better looking in person.\" Davis was reportedly fired from a job at ABC two decades ago after sending a sexually explicit photo over his company computer network. Before the case was filed, 21st Century Fox issued a statement to Deadline claiming that the allegations expected to be contained in the suit were \"without merit.\" On Thursday, it said: \"Jessica Golloher's claims are without merit. Her allegations of discrimination and retaliation are baseless. We will vigorously defend the matter.\" A source familiar with the matter said the independent law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, which is investigating claims of sexual harassment at the network, reached out twice to Golloher, but did not receive a response. Further, the source said her contract was not renewed amid budget cutbacks that eliminated the Fox News Radio position at the network's bureau in Jerusalem, where she was a correspondent. The lawsuit is one in a series brought by Wigdor against the network in the wake of former host Bill O'Reilly's departure from Fox following new allegations of past sexual harassment. Eleven current and former employees sued Fox News in late April, alleging widespread instances of racial discrimination. \"I could no longer sit in silence, collect my paycheck, and act like I didn't experience racial bias on my own level as an on-air personality,\" Fox News anchor Kelly Wright told reporters in April, saying he was asked to be a \"Jim Crow caricature\" on air. Fox has undergone a major shakeup in leadership that saw the departure of O'Reilly and former co-president Bill Shine. The network has not appeared to take a major ratings hit amid the turmoil. Fox remained the top rated network last month, though ratings dipped slightly for MSNBC and Fox on a month-to-month basis for the first time since the 2016 presidential election.",

With $124 billion, Microsoft had the most profits among S&P 500 companies kept outside the US last year, according to fourth-quarter company filings compiled by UBS.

However, in mid-April, a Markets Insider analysis found that Buffett's IBM investment had lost $787 million in value since he first invested circa 2011.The reason for the IBM sell-off: He's \"revalued it somewhat downward\" from six years ago, when he first bought into the company, as \"big strong competitors\" continue to take wind out of the tech titan's sails. He says he sold when the stock crested $180, but has stopped selling now that it's around $160.While Buffett didn't appear to name names, cloud computing providers like Amazon Web Services have placed a lot of pressure on server-focused companies like IBM -- the same dynamic that led IBM competitor Dell to its mega-merger with fellow server titan EMC.It hasn't been an easy 2017 for IBM, either.

    "content": "Kevin HartKevin Winter/GettyNEW YORK -- YouTube plans to produce a slate of original video programs to air on its website, as the Google-owned company seeks to retain its audience amid competition from the likes of Netflix, Hulu, and Facebook.During a presentation at New York's Javits Center on Thursday, YouTube boss Susan Wojcicki showcased some of the new programs, which she said were something that YouTube advertisers had been asking for.The shows will feature big-name celebrities like Ryan Seacrest and comedian Kevin Hart, and will be available exclusively on YouTube's free, advertiser-supported website, and not on the company's subscription-based premium service, YouTube Red.YouTube is the world's most popular video streaming website, but much of the content is unpolished, created by amateurs and occasionally offensive -- a problem that has come to the fore in recent months as advertisers discovered that their ads appeared alongside violent and racist videos. More than 250 brands reportedly pulled their spending.\"We apologize for letting some of you down,\" Wojcicki said on Thursday. \"We can and we will do better.\"The effort to bankroll high-quality original programming for the site marks YouTube's third attempt at playing a more direct role in shaping the content on its site, and underscores the challenge of finding the right formula for success in video streaming. YouTube initially spent more than $100 million in 2011 to help launch channels anchored by big names like Madonna and ESPN. That initiative was not entirely successful, and YouTube took another shot a few years later, this time relying on home-grown YouTube stars instead of celebrities. Now it appears that YouTube has reversed course yet again, and believes that celebrity talent is a key to success at a time when rivals like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu are pouring large amounts of money into professionally-produced original programs.YouTube is still investing in its homegrown talent too, with YouTube stars involved in the majority of roughly 40 original programs the company is rolling out for its various platforms.When describing why YouTube was undertaking this celebrity-driven initiative now, YouTube's business chief Robert Kyncl said it was because completely ad-supported series were \"becoming more and more rare.\" He said increasingly more premium video was going to subscription services, and that YouTube sees these shows as a way to partner with advertisers to \"buck this trend.\"In total, YouTube announced 6 new original shows with stars including Demi Lovato, Ellen DeGeneres, comedy duo Rhett & Link.Here is the descriptions of the shows, from YouTube:",

    "title": "Justice Department opens criminal investigation into Uber's use of questionable software",
    "content": "REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has begun a criminal investigation into Uber's use of a software tool that helped its drivers evade local transportation regulators, two sources familiar with the situation said. Uber has acknowledged the software, known as \"Greyball,\" helped it identify and circumvent government officials who were trying to clamp down on Uber in areas where its service had not yet been approved, such as Portland, Oregon. The company prohibited the use of Greyball for this purpose shortly after the New York Times revealed its existence in March, saying the program was created to check ride requests to prevent fraud and safeguard drivers. The Times report triggered a barrage of negative publicity for the company. The criminal probe could become a significant problem facing the company that is already struggling with an array of recent business and legal issues. An Uber spokesman and the Justice Department declined to comment. Uber lawyers said in letters to Portland authorities, which Portland made public in a report last week, that the Greyball technology was used \"exceedingly sparingly\" in that city, before the service was approved there in 2015. The nature of any potential federal criminal violation, and the likelihood of anyone being charged, is unclear. The investigation is still in its early stages, the sources said. Bloomberg news service reported the existence of a federal probe last week, but did not identify it as criminal. Uber received a subpoena from a Northern California grand jury seeking documents concerning how the software tool functioned and where it was deployed, one person familiar with the request said. That indicates a criminal investigation is underway. The second source confirmed that was the case. A subpoena from a grand jury is a formal request for documents or testimony concerning a potential crime. It does not, in itself, indicate wrongdoing or mean charges will be brought. The ride services company's board has retained an outside law firm, Shearman & Sterling LLP, to conduct its own internal investigation into what transpired, those two sources and a third said. A Shearman spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment. Uber, a venture capital-backed firm most recently valued at $68 billion, has long had a reputation as an aggressive startup. Reuters Staff It has been battered with multiple controversies over the last few months that have raised questions about Chief Executive Travis Kalanick and led him to say he needed \"leadership help.\" The technology at issue in the criminal probe helped Uber tag some users so that they saw a different version of its standard app, the company said in a blog post in March. Uber said Greyball obscured the real location of Uber cars in various circumstances, including the possibility of physical threats or merely to test new features. The program was part of a broader Uber system, called Violation of Terms of Service, that analyzed credit card, device identification, location data and other factors to predict whether a request for a ride was legitimate, current and former employees said. The technology was used partly to prevent fraud and protect drivers from harm, the company blog post said. If a ride request was deemed illegitimate, Uber's app showed bogus information and the requester would not be picked up, the employees told Reuters. However, the Greyball technique was also used against suspected local officials who could have been looking to fine drivers, impound cars or otherwise prevent Uber from operating, the employees said. The system might have gone farther than suggested by Uber's terms of service for app users. For example, it mined credit card information to see if the owner was affiliated with a credit union used by police and checked social media profiles to assess the likelihood that the person was in law enforcement. After the Times exposed the program in March, regulators who had been unable to catch Uber in places where it was banned accused the company of obstructing their inquiries. Transportation officials in Portland investigated and reported last week that Uber had used Greyball to evade 16 Portland Bureau of Transportation officials, denying them dozens of rides, in December 2014 before Uber was authorized to operate there. The city said it found no evidence that the behavior was repeated when Uber re-entered the market in April 2015. Uber said it used the Greyball technology in December 2014, while it was operating without approval, because it was \"deeply concerned that its driver-partners would be penalized financially\" or otherwise for their driving.

    "content": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. REUTERS/Shu Zhang Facebook shareholders seeking to block Mark Zuckerberg's plan to create a new class of non-voting stock will have their day in court. A trial for the lawsuit challenging the plan is on the calendar and is set to kick off on September 26, 2017, Facebook revealed on Thursday. The class action lawsuit seeks to block Facebook's plan to reclassify its stock structure and create a new class of non-voting shares. The new shares are designed to concentrate Zuckerberg's majority voting rights even as he sells his shares to fund his philanthropic efforts. If the shareholder plaintiffs prevail, Zuckerberg will have to find a different way to fund his commitment to give 99% of his fortune away before he dies. Facebook could also still choose to settle the case outside of court. The September trial will take place in the Delaware Chancery Court, according to a form Facebook filed with the SEC on Thursday. Facebook declined to comment and representatives for the plaintiff's lawyers didn't immediately return a request for comment. So far, the lawsuit's discovery process has surfaced controversial text messages between Zuckerberg and Facebook board member Marc Andreessen, who the plaintiffs have accused of surreptitiously coaching Zuckerberg through a negotiation process to win board approval for the stock change. The texts also indicate that Zuckerberg has seriously considered holding some form of public office. Zuckerberg, who cofounded Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, already has complete control of the company, with roughly 60% of the voting power, according to Facebook's most recent proxy filing. The new structure, with the non-voting shares, would allow Zuckerberg to continue to maintain control for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, Zuckerberg's desired stock reclassification is pending the outcome of the lawsuit. Interestingly, the stock structure trial is only one of two big cases on the docket for Facebook this year. The company is also facing a lawsuit from Social Ranger LLC, which has sued Facebook for antitrust violations related to virtual currency services. Facebook said in its 10Q filing Thursday that the case, which it believes is without merit, is schedule to go to trial on June 12, 2017. Here's what Facebook said about that case: \"The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and seeks treble damages and an injunction. The court denied our motion to dismiss; our motion for summary judgment is pending. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend against all claims asserted. Trial is scheduled to begin on June 12, 2017. Because the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, we believe it is reasonably possible that we may incur a loss in connection with this matter. However, we do not believe a material loss is probable and we are unable to estimate a reasonable range of loss, if any, that could result were there to be an adverse final decision, and we therefore have not accrued a liability for this matter. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur in this case, it is possible that the impact could be material to our results in the period(s) in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable.\"",

    "content": "Oracle is as famous within the tech industry for its legal department as it is for its ubiquitous database software. The company's lawyer-heavy reputation was immortalized in this classic comic by Googler Manu Cornet: Manu Cornet/Wikimedia CommonsAt a media event at Oracle's Silicon Valley headquarters, co-CEO Mark Hurd told Recode's Kara Swisher that the switch to cloud computing -- where customers rent functionally unlimited supercomputing power and applications from companies like Oracle -- has required Oracle to rethink this approach, at least a little. (Swisher's full conversation with Hurd will be featured in a forthcoming episode of the Recode Decode podcast.)Hurd uses the example of ride-hailing app Lyft, a flagship customer of Oracle's accounting and financial cloud software.\"Historically,\" Hurd says, Oracle would write \"big contracts\" for customers, the procurement department would vet it, lawyers for both sides would negotiate the terms, and that would be that. But startups like Lyft don't have a formal procurement department, or the same kind of IT buying process as those big Fortune 500 companies. Oracle co-CEO Mark HurdOracleIt means \"we can't show up with lawyers and stuff,\" says Hurd. And so, Hurd explains, Oracle took all the terms that would be in the normal contract, and made it something in which a customer can simply \"click to accept\" -- sort of like the iTunes consumer terms of service.In the standard contract negotiation process, says Hurd, customers would usually ask for special terms, and \"80% of the time, if if you asked, you got them.\" Now, Hurd says, Oracle includes most of those special terms into that \"click to accept\" contract, streamlining the whole process. This move makes it easier for Oracle to bring customers on board, quickly, Hurd says -- which is good, given the company's ambitious, but somewhat controversial, play to topple Amazon Web Services, the intensely profitable arm of the Amazon retail empire, currently considered the cloud to beat. Indeed, Hurd credits much of Amazon's success with its ability to bring customers onto their platform without ever having to talk to a salesperson: \"I think they've done a good job creating a frictionless acquisition process for customers.\"Visit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

The company sold 50.8 million of its flagship product this past quarter -- that's a massive number for most companies not named Apple, but a tad below the 52 million or so analysts were expecting.And as this chart from Statista shows, it continued an ongoing trend of iPhone sales growth staying relatively flat year-over-year. After last quarter brought a momentary rise in sales -- boosted in part by Apple counting an extra week during the period -- this quarter's figure fell slightly below where it was a year ago.To be clear: Apple is doing fine. Beyond the obvious fact that it's still selling a massive number of iPhones every quarter, its revenue is up in most of the world, and its services business is extracting more and more cash from the big user base it already has.But it's been clear for some time now that the boom caused by the iPhone 6 has tailed off. To hear CEO Tim Cook tell it, part of the sales slowdown is due to sheer anticipation for the iPhone 8. The bigger problem, though, may be the company's ongoing decline in China, its main growth engine in recent years. The iPhone has taken a big tumble in the region in terms of market share, falling to just 9.6% last year.

    "title": "A strange technique that involves observing your own brain activity could be the future of treating depression",
    "content": "Getty Images/Dan Kitwood A non-invasive technique that stimulates a part of the brain known to be involved in depression could have major benefits for people with the disorder, a recent study has found. The technique involves having a person observe the activity of their own amygdala, and consciously try to increase that activity by recalling positive memories. It's called fMRI neurofeedback. Kymberly Young, the leading author of the new study and an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, says the experiment, while small, yielded promising results. For the study, Young divided 36 adult volunteers with depression into two groups -- one that did the neurofeedback on their amygdalas and a control that did a fake neurofeedback exercise on a part of the brain not involved in emotional processing. People in both groups had their brains scanned by an fMRI to pinpoint the location of either their amygdala or the control region of the brain. The researchers then showed the participants a signal from the part of the brain being measured and had the participants try to regulate the strength of that signal by recalling happy moments. After two sessions, 12 out of 19 participants who tried fMRI neurofeedback showed a significant decrease in a standard rating scale of depression after two sessions, compared with just two people in the control group. \"We're at the stage where we are showing this is effective,\" Young says. One of the reasons Young and her team believe the treatment could be so successful is because of the known role that the amygdala plays in depression. The amygdalas of depressed people tend to more responsive to negative emotional cues, like a photograph that reminds them of a frightening situation, and less responsive to positive emotional cues, like a happy childhood memory. Young therefore aims to see whether increasing the amygdala's responsiveness to positive recollections might help reduce depressive symptoms. But fMRI neurofeedback, she warns, should not be equated with EEG neurofeedback, a technique that involves teaching people to control their own brain waves (allegedly) using an EEG machine. Unlike fMRI neurofeedback, EEG neurofeedback uses electrodes placed on the head to get a rough approximation of the brain's electrical activity across certain bands. If an fMRI is Google Maps for the brain, Young says, EEG is a rough, hand-drawn street map. As a result, \"we can get at deep brain structures such as the amygdala that EEG neurofeedback simply can't get to,\" she says. While fMRI neurofeedback is still incredibly new, EEG neurofeedback has been around for years, and dozens of companies across the globe market it as a way to cure serious mental illnesses like depression and ADHD and boost athletic performance. The method is backed by education secretary Betsy DeVos, who has invested in an EEG neurofeedback provider called Neurocore. But Young is doubtful about that technique, and concerned that confusion between fMRI neurofeedback and EEG neurofeedback could end up harming some of her research. \"Nobody's really doing any controlled studies of EEG neurofeedback,\" says Young, \"so it's likely that what they're seeing is just a placebo response.\" Young's next step will be to pin down how to transfer what her team is learning from fMRI studies into a form of training or treatment that can be accessible for people who need it.",

    "content": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Instagram / @urbanearsAfter six years of making headphones, Urbanears has recently launched their first set of speakers.The company sent me one of the higher-end models -- called Baggen -- to try out and I've been very impressed.With an emphasis on aesthetics, connectivity, and sound quality, Urbanears makes a strong case for replacing a traditional stereo for most people.The Baggen has a minimalist design that will fit into whichever room it's in easily. It comes in a handful of colors, some of them nontraditional for speakers. The model I tried was pink, and it drew the eye of the few people who have come into my apartment recently. I mean that in a good way; this speaker looks modern and more like a piece of furniture than audio equipment. Flipping the speaker on its side reveals a place to plug in a power cable and an auxiliary input if you'd like to hook up a turntable or other analog wired device. The Baggen isn't portable. It has to be plugged in at all times, which differentiates it from most wireless speakers currently on the market, but there's a good reason for that.Urbanears designed this speaker -- and its smaller sibling, the Stammen -- to be connected together for multi-speaker setups. That can't work consistently if the speakers aren't always on and synced with one another, so it was a trade off worth making for audio options in this price range. Speaking of connectivity, the Baggen supports every major wireless audio standard I've come across: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Chromecast, and Airplay are all options. For a majority of testing I connected via Bluetooth, which was easy enough to set up. I was able to connect to the speaker through Wi-Fi, too, but it took multiple attempts and required me to use Urbanears' app. Looks and functionality aside, the most important part of audio equipment is how it sounds, and the Baggen is the best-sounding speaker I've tested to date. To be fair, its $450 price tag suggests it should sound excellent, but its clear that Urbanears spent a long time sweating the details. The aim of high-end speakers is to make music sound balanced -- every instrument should be audible and distinct.That was the case during my tests; I was able to pick up very small details from my favorite songs. Music from all genres, whether it was recorded in 1967 or 2017, sounded excellent.For most people I know, the Baggen could easily serve as the only speaker they'd need. It's loud enough (too loud, at maximum volume for my small apartment) and sounds excellent. It's not going to replace a traditional stereo for real audiophiles, but that doesn't seem to be Urbanears' target market. In alignment with its look, you should consider the Baggen to be a piece of furniture, something static that performs its function very well.Regardless of how you like to listen to your music, or which genre you listen to, this speaker will likely impress you almost every time you use it.If you want to see more from Insider Picks, we're collecting emails for an upcoming newsletter.

    "content": "Media stocks took a dive this week, following bad news about subscriber numbers for pay TV (~400,000 below expectations) and worrying comments from Turner about the TV ad market. The subscriber decline, in particular, should concern cable and satellite TV companies. \"After two quarters of slight improvements, pay TV subscriber declines appear to have accelerated markedly in 1Q17,\" UBS analysts led by Doug Mitchelson wrote in a note Wednesday. One thing this could mean: The new streaming TV bundles (vMVPDs), such as YouTube TV and DirecTV Now, aren't the savior the industry was hoping for -- at least not yet. \"The cord cutting acceleration contrasts with the media bull case that [streaming TV packages] will stabilize or improve pay TV declines,\" UBS wrote. UBS gave a few potential reasons for the acceleration of subscriber losses: Whatever the reason, the decline is likely to spark fears that cord-cutting will finally start to get moving in a way that will hurt the pay TV industry. For instance, in a recent report on the future of ESPN, Morgan Stanley wrote that the growth of streaming TV services would cause \"subscriber erosion trends to improve.\" Basically, that these services would turn around the growth picture. That might not be the case. \"The industry can't resist change anymore,\" industry analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a note about cord-cutting, according to Variety. \"The future has arrived.\" Here is a chart from UBS that puts that into perspective, showing how subscriber declines have accelerated (both with and without new streaming bundles): UBS",

    "content": "A lot of things you use on a daily basis have their roots in DARPA projects that were intended for military purposes. Sharon Weinberger, the author of the book \"The Imagineers of War,\" describes a few of these inventions that you might not have been aware of, like the Roomba.Follow Tech Insider: On FacebookFollowing is a transcript of the video:So many of the things we use every day is linked to DARPA. Sort of the more common example today is the Siri app on the iPhone. That grew directly out of a DARPA-funded project that wasn't picked up by the military. The people working on it spun it off as an independent company, and it was bought by Apple and incorporated into the iPhone. I think, sort of, what made DARPA's reputation was computer networking. DARPA created the ARPANET, which was the first network of computers, which was later transitioned to the civilian internet. And that really cemented DARPA's reputation as sort of an innovation agency or genius factory. Other things that can be linked back to DARPA: GPS. So this is a tricky one. There's a lot of times that DARPA claims GPS as its invention. It's a little bit more complicated than that. DARPA, for a while, funded the predecessor to GPS called the Transit satellite. But DARPA did not invent GPS. But it gets a little bit of credit there. iRobot, the company that makes the Roomba, the robotic vacuum cleaner, basically exists today, and its underlying technology exists because of DARPA funding. So DARPA didn't specifically fund the Roomba, but it funded the company and its military work, which then eventually became the Roomba. What DARPA was interested in, and one of the things that got military funding, was the PackBot, which is made by iRobot, the same people who make Roomba, which was used for bomb disposal. I think the most important commercial innovation that is emerging today are autonomous cars, self-driving cars that we're just now seeing come into their own. That's linked directly back, not just to decades of DARPA funding in robotics, which DARPA did, but also, most importantly, or at least importantly to the mid-2000s, when DARPA started a series of robotic car races called the Grand Challenge. And that really is what jump-started the autonomous care industry. DARPA doesn't make money off of the products it funds. It's a little bit complicated, especially when dealing with patents and intellectual property. What DARPA gets, and what DARPA hopes to get, is products that will serve the military, that can be used by the military. But if a company wants to spin it off into the commercial realm, it it can and it does.",

    "content": "A Capital One Cafe employee uses an Apple Watch to communicate with coworkersYouTube/AppleWhen Apple reported its financial results earlier this week, its CFO Luca Maestri mentioned that the company had cut a deal with Capital One to buy Apple Watches for employees.Apple has consistently said that Watch is selling well, and CEO Tim Cook indicated that Watch was part of a multi-billion \"wearables\" business at Apple (along with Beats headphones), but gave no specifics about it.Still, there are indications that it's not a hot product, and is perhaps a real dud. For instance, some big names quietly dropped support for their Watch apps in recent weeks including Google Maps, Amazon, and eBay. So if enterprises are becoming interested in the Watch for their employees that could be a real boon.Capital One has been a showcase enterprise customer for Apple, and has outfitted some 30,000 of its 40,000-strong workforce with Macs and iPads, and developed a whopping 30 custom internal apps for employees to use to do their jobs.Capital One did not exactly buy 30,000 Apple Watches. But it did buy watches for \"hundreds\" of them, the company told Business Insider.The Watches were issued to all of the employees of its Capital One Cafe network, a combo coffee shop and bank, where people can learn about Capital One's financial products while sipping on a latte.The employees mostly use the Watches to communicate with one another. Each watch comes with its own phone. While all employees get their own Watch/iPhone combo, the devices are treated more like corporate PCs. They are left at the Cafe at the end of their shifts, and are not brought home or used by employees for personal purposes.Capital One worked with Apple to set up the Watches with the apps, a spokesperson tells us, and employees use the Watches for things like:\"Before using the watches, the ambassador would either stand in line with the customer, hand the customer a free coffee card, or leave the customer's side to order the coffee,\" the spokesperson told us.By using the Apple Watches, they can order coffee while chatting with customers anywhere in the cafe, and the drink is delivered.It's hard to say that this kind of restaurant/retail environment will be a breakthrough use for Watch, and lead to a large volume of sales. But it does generally showcase that a wearable device, instead of an iPad, could one day work in that market.In this promo video shot by Apple last month about how Capital One is using its products, they briefly show the Watch and the Cafe at 2:28.",

And unlike Free Basics, this program grants access to all of the web - or at least, as much as the Indian government allows.Following tests that began back in 2015, Express Wi-Fi is now live across nearly 700 hotspots in four Indian states of Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Meghalaya. Users can log on by purchasing physical and online vouchers that cost between Rs. 10-20 ($0.15 - $0.30) for 0.1GB a day, or Rs. 200-300 ($3.12 - $4.67) for 20GB for a month, from 500 brick-and-mortar stores in those states.India isn't the first country where Facebook has rolled out Express Wi-Fi: it's previously launched the service in Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria and Indonesia. The company plans to connect another 20,000 hotspots across India in partnership with telecom giant Airtel.That's a big move for Facebook: the social network says it's closing in on 2 billion users worldwide, and India, with its population of 1.3 billion, reportedly only has about 390 million people accessing the web at present.

    "title": "Bitcoin just soared to a new $1,600 high -- but the first investor in Snapchat thinks it could hit $500,000 by 2030",
    "content": "Jeremy Liew. Getty Bitcoin has been the top-performing currency in the world in six of the past seven years, climbing from zero to a new high value of about $1,600. But the cryptocurrency isn't anywhere close to its potential, according to Jeremy Liew, the first investor in Snapchat, and Peter Smith, the CEO and cofounder of Blockchain. In a presentation sent to Business Insider, the duo laid out their case for bitcoin exploding to $500,000 by 2030. Their argument is based on increased interest in bitcoin, thanks to: Remittance transfers, or electronic money transfers to foreign countries, have almost doubled over the past 15 years to 0.76% of gross world product, data from the World Bank shows. \"Expats sending money home have found in bitcoin an inexpensive alternative, and we assume that the percentage of bitcoin-based remittances will sharply increase with greater bitcoin awareness,\" the two said. Liew and Smith said increased political uncertainty in the UK, US, and developing nations would help elevate the level of interest in bitcoin. \"We believe bitcoin awareness, high liquidity, ease of transport, and continued market outperformance as geopolitical risks mount will make bitcoin a strong contender for investment at a consumer and investor level,\" the two said. Liew and Smith said the percentage of noncash transactions would climb from 15% to 30% in the next 10 years as the world becomes more connected through smartphones. The global smartphone penetration rate is 63%, and the total number of smartphone users is expected to increase by 1 billion by 2020. The GSMA, a trade body that represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, says 90% of these users will come from developing countries. This would make it possible for nearly everyone to have a bank in their pocket, and that should provide a boost for bitcoin as well. Liew and Smith say bitcoin could account for 50% of all noncash transactions. Here are the basic model drivers Liew and Smith used: But a lot could go wrong, too. News surrounding bitcoin has been rather negative as of late. China, which is responsible for nearly 100% of trading in bitcoin, has been cracking down on trading. The three biggest exchanges recently announced a 0.2% fee on all transactions and blocked withdrawals from trading accounts. The US Securities and Exchange Commission also rejected two bitcoin exchange-traded funds and will rule on another one in the future. It's not expected to be approved. However, Smith says bitcoin is still in its early stages. \"The SEC's ruling wasn't a surprise to us,\" he told Business Insider. He said that \"getting that sort of approval\" could take a long time. \"In the meantime, bitcoin is already simple to buy and hold, and as the asset continues to mature, we'll continue to see an increase in the development and deployment of surrounding products,\" he said. Markets Insider And while bitcoin hasn't been granted regulatory approval in the US, it is catching on elsewhere. On April 1, the cryptocurrency became a legal payment method in Japan. Another threat to its future is developers who are threatening to set up a \"hard fork,\" or alternative marketplace for bitcoin. This would result in the split of into bitcoin and bitcoin unlimited. However, Smith isn't worried. \"Bitcoin has strong economic incentives to prevent this,\" he said. \"If the last two years of healthy contention and debate lead to a conclusion, it's that bitcoin is incredibly resilient and stable. In fact, the bitcoin blockchain has operated for seven-plus years with no downtime, a feat no other back-end system operating at this scale can claim.\" But the cryptocurrency sees violent price swings uncommon among the more traditional currencies. Bitcoin rallied 20% in the first week of 2017 before crashing 35% on word that China was cracking down on trading. The cryptocurrency has regained those losses and is trading up about 67% so far this year. Get the latest Bitcoin price here.",

More than 26,000 contracts have already changed hands today, 42% more than the 20-day average.The bullishness may be in response to Snap's earlier announcement that it's releasing a self-service ads manager. The move is expected to broaden the number of advertisers who do business with Snap, which is already expected to see ad revenue of $1 billion this year.Snap will report quarterly earnings for the first time on May 10.

    "content": "BI IntelligenceThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here.Amazon jumped headlong into voice, and other tech leaders like Google and Samsung have followed suit.Facebook, though, is holding back its Messenger team from developing a voice assistant, according to Messenger product head Stan Chudnovsky, reports Recode.Voice control still has a number of issues in recognition and AI that are keeping some companies from embracing it as a control mechanism.Chudnovsky doesn't think that voice, as Facebook would use it, is up to the task of everyday use. Voice control isn't just about accurate recognition; a voice assistant needs to recognize not just the spoken words but also the intent behind those words, and be able to fulfill a user's request or respond to a query. If each of those three steps has a 90% success rate, that would mean that 73% of voice assistant requests would end in failure. Microsoft and IBM touted voice recognition rates of around 94%.Even as voice-controlled devices proliferate, there is the potential for missteps that could harm voice's growth as an interface. Some users are already wary of voice; buggy technology is the main drawback to voice assistants for 19% of respondents to a BI Intelligence survey.If users have frustrating interactions with voice assistants that control their connected devices, they could lose faith in voice as an interface altogether, despite the best efforts of tech companies.Advancements in a bevy of industries are helping intelligent digital voice assistants like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa become more sophisticated and useful pieces of technology. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are allowing them to accurately understand more information, while upgrades to mobile networks are facilitating quick transfers of data to robust clouds, enabling fast response times. In addition, the swell of internet connected devices like smart thermostats and speakers is giving voice assistants more utility in a connected consumer's life. Increasingly sophisticated voice assistants and the growing potential use cases they can assist in are driving consumers to adopt them in greater droves -- 65% of US smartphone owners were employing voice assistants in 2015, up significantly from 30% just two years prior. Consumers are also eagerly adopting speaker-based voice assistants, with shipments of Google Home and Amazon Echo speakers expected to climb more than threefold to 24.5 million in 2017, according to a report from VoiceLabs.However, there are still numerous barriers that need to be overcome before this product platform will see mass adoption, as both technological challenges and societal hurdles persist. Jessica Smith, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the voice assistant landscape that explains what's driving the recent upsurge in adoption of digital voice assistants. It explores the recent technology advancements that have catalyzed this growth, while presenting the technological shortcomings preventing voice assistants from hitting their true potential. This report also examines the voice assistant landscape, and discusses the leading voice assistants and the devices through which consumers interact with them. Finally, it identifies the major barriers to mass adoption, and the impact voice assistants could have in numerous industries once they cross that threshold.

    "title": "The CEO paying employees $10,000 to leave San Francisco explains how it's helping him build a $20 million business",
    "content": "Zapier cofounders, right to left: Wade Foster, Bryan Helmig, and Mike Knoop, circa 2012. Zapier Back in March, a company called Zapier made headlines when it announced it would pay $10,000 in moving expenses for new employees to leave the expensive San Francisco Bay Area -- the opposite of how it usually works. Now, Zapier CEO Wade Foster tells Business Insider, this \"de-location\" offer garnered Zapier 1,167 job applications in 10 days, a 32% increase from their normal rate. (He also says that \"Zapier\" rhymes with \"happier,\" in case you were wondering.) In general, Foster says, the de-location idea is just an extension of what makes Zapier so great: The company's 85-person team all works remotely from their homes all across the globe. You don't need to live in San Francisco to be a tech genius, or New York, or Austin, so why should you live anywhere if you don't want to? It helps with recruiting, Foster says, since candidates don't have to be in any one city to be considered for a position, and it keeps employees happy and productive by letting them live where and how they'd like -- especially since they can draw a Silicon Valley salary without having to live somewhere with sky-high rent. A map showing where around the world Zapier employees live and work. Zapier \"For us, it's more about letting [employees] set up the life they want,\" says Foster. \"There's massive amounts of smart people all over the world.\" That philosophy has led Zapier, a tool for integrating business software together, to some success. Foster tells Business Insider that Zapier is on a $20 million annualized run rate, a measure of how much revenue it expects to generate in a year. Furthermore, he says, Zapier has been profitable since 2014, after taking a relatively meager $1.3 million back in 2012. And today, Zapier is introducing a new product for businesses to keep it going. Zapier started back in 2011 as a side hustle -- Foster and his cofounders Mike Knoop and Bryan Helmig worked on it nights and weekends. Knoop and Helmig met because, at the time, they were the only people on HackerNews from Columbus, Missouri; Helmig and Foster met when they were in a Jazz quartet together. A few months in, and the team had enough users and revenue to get accepted into Silicon Valley's famed Y Combinator startup mentorship program, and moved to California. The Zapier team meets in Texas for their 2017 team offsite. Zapier While the three cofounders ended up settling in the San Francisco Bay Area, they decided not to open a formal office, but instead go the \"all-remote\" route. The idea was to streamline the business as much as possible in the early days, and the idea stuck. Foster says that this philosophy has also helped keep the company focused: With only that $1.3 million in funding under its belt, Zapier has never given up control to outside investors, which helps the company stay focused on what it does best. \"When you raise money, there's a tendency to try to be everything to everybody,\" says Foster. What Zapier actually does is help connect one piece of software or a web service to another. For instance, to use a Zapier example, you could have every single e-mail attachment from Gmail copied into your Dropbox, and then alert you in Slack that you have a new file to review. It's similar to the popular IFTTT service, but with more of a focus on work software, and Foster says that there are over 800 pieces of software that you can \"zap\" together from Zapier. That includes Facebook Pages, Microsoft Office 365, and GitHub. The new Zapier for Teams makes it easier to use the service as, well, part of a team. If you come up with a killer workflow -- say, to automatically e-mail every new hire all their new paperwork, while simultaneously sending a welcome message in Slack -- you can share it with your coworkers. Example Zapier \"Zap\" integrations Zapier Zapier is in the right place at the right time, Foster says, because the Silicon Valley tech boom has led to a whole range of startups making software that's hyper-specialized for different departments and job functions. Zapier presents a way to manage the chaos and have all those disparate tools work with each other. \"The cost of starting companies is going down,\" says Foster. \"It's easier than ever to target a specific vertical.\" And with so many apps, and so much software, coming to the workplace, Foster says that Zapier is a great way for products to find customers, and for customers to find products. \"It's kind of a no-brainer for companies to hook into Zapier,\" says Foster.",

    "content": "A bizarre and brilliant new video game is exploding in popularity right now. The game isn't even fully complete -- it's available in \"early access\" on Steam, for $30 -- but it's already grossed over $60 million. It's called \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,\" and, on the surface, it looks like a run-of-the-mill shooter. It's anything but. Bluehole Studios The player you see above is just one out of 100 people who are stuck on a deserted island that's rife with weapons. The objective: Be the last person alive when the match ends. You have one life, limited ammo, and can withstand a few bullets at most. It's an intense, smart, suspenseful game that, frankly, we can't stop playing. There's just one problem at the moment: It's only available on PC. At the beginning of each round of \"Battlegrounds,\" all 100 players parachute down to a deserted island. One person will make it out alive. SideArms4Reason/YouTube But there's good news on the horizon, as the game will head to home game consoles, Business Insider has learned. \"We have a team working already on looking to port it to at least the Xbox [One],\" the game's creative director, Brendan \"PlayerUnknown\" Greene told us in a recent interview. \"We're looking at both consoles of course, but we have no time frame for both.\" Since the game is still in \"early access\" -- playable and purchasable, but not complete -- it's going to be awhile before \"Battlegrounds\" makes its way from PC to consoles. But rest assured: It's coming. \"We have no time frame yet exactly on Xbox [One] or PlayStation [4], but we are looking at it,\" Greene told us. \"Battlegrounds\" takes place on a deserted island in a (fictional) ex-Soviet region. It looks like post-apocalypse Russia, basically. Bluehole Studios We do, however, have some idea of how far away it might be. Since Greene and his team at Bluehole Studios in Korea are planning to have the PC version completed in the next five months (\"or so,\" says Greene), an Xbox One or PlayStation 4 port (or both!) could be ready by the end of 2017. \"Ports to consoles isn't that hard,\" Greene said. It's a measure of the game engine that \"Battlegrounds\" was built with, which is called Unreal Engine 4. It's the software that Greene and his team used to build \"Battlegrounds,\" and it's particularly useful for making a game that will function on several different platforms (PC, consoles, mobile, etc.). \"It's a great engine to use for multiplatform,\" he said. Maybe most importantly of all, it sounds like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 ports of \"Battlegrounds\" are already in the works. \"We have a great producer and he can manage a lot of stuff,\" Greene said. \"We have the resources to focus on getting the PC version done, but also look at how quickly we can bring it to other platforms.\" Bluehold Studios That's not all that Greene and co. are working on. \"We have other game modes we want to add, and there's modding as well down the road,\" he noted. Lots to look forward to, it sounds like!",

    "content": "Yuriko Nakao/Reuters Ever since 1950 when Japan began tracking its population of children, the number has never been as low as it is today. New data from the Internal Affairs and Communications Ministry finds the population shrank by 170,000 kids from this time last year, to a new low of 15.71 million, The Japan Times reports. This is the 36th consecutive year the population has dropped. Japan's fertility crisis has been many years in the making. As older generations start to die off without younger generations starting families behind them, economists say Japan shows all the signs of a \"demographic time bomb.\" Without any intervention, Japan's economy will only continue to shrink. \"We will continue to put efforts into support for child-rearing,\" welfare minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki told The Japan Times in December of last year. Japan's fertility rate is among the lowest in the world, at just 1.4 births per woman. Sociologists have found populations stay steady when a country has at least 2.1 births per woman. Beneath that threshold, and countries are likely to see their populations start to decline, which Japan has. The trend has also led to another record-low, according to the new data: Japan's ratio of children to the rest of the population is just 12.4%. That marks the 43rd straight year of declines and places Japan's ratio at the very bottom of countries with 40 million people or more. Other countries do face similar problems, including the US, Denmark, China, and Singapore -- with fertility rates of 1.87, 1.73, 1.6, and 0.81, respectively -- although Japan's case may be the most severe. A 2016 study conducted by a Japanese research firm found that nearly 70% of unmarried Japanese men and 60% of unmarried Japanese women weren't in relationships. This is despite most people claiming they do want to get married eventually. Japan has gone to some great lengths to boost its fertility rate to the goal of 1.8 births per woman by 2025, as set by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. For instance, the country is letting men play with dolls to get accustomed to fatherhood. And the government is organizing speed-dating events to help young people meet. In the meantime, the time bomb has forced Japan to recognize the importance of innovation more than ever -- specifically, with robotics technology. Without strapping youngsters to do the work, machines may be the next best thing.",

    "title": "A new documentary gives us an up-close, creepy look at WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange",
    "content": "Julian Assange in \"Risk.\" Neon Coming off her Oscar-winning film \"Citizenfour\" about NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, director Laura Poitras returns with \"Risk,\" a profile of another controversial figure in the hacker community: WikiLeaks founder . Filming over six years, Poitras got access to Assange that she says in the documentary was beyond what she expected. The WikiLeaks head navigates his budding popularity while also fighting off allegations of sexual assault and rape. Those claims are why he has remained inside the Embassy of Ecuador in London since the summer of 2012, when the country granted him asylum. Poitras is a fly on the wall during some of the most important moments of WikiLeaks' existence: the series of leaks provided by Chelsea Manning, assisting Snowden to leave Hong Kong after news broke of his leaks, and, most recently, the leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential election (though there are accusations that Russia worked with WikiLeaks on the leaked election emails, Assange denies the charge). But then there's the glance at simply the man behind the site. Poitras portrays Assange as someone filled with contradictions, who is constantly paranoid and extremely vindictive. Poitras is under the impression through most of the movie that Assange doesn't like her, though he continues to give her an incredible window into his daily life. Assange disguising himself. Neon Poitras is even there beside Assange in the hotel room preparing for his secretive dash to the Embassy of Ecuador, which included his coloring his hair and sporting a goatee so he wouldn't be recognized as he sped on a motorcycle through London. Poitras also offers glimpses into how her life has been affected by being in Assange's inner circle. She speaks of being detained in airports, and there's leaked FBI audio of agents talking about her, saying the American filmmaker is \"anti-US.\" Then there's Poitras' involvement with Snowden. When Assange sees that Poitras was behind the footage of Snowden revealing his reasons for leaking, the WikiLeaks figurehead becomes enraged that Poitras didn't bring the Snowden info to him (it was released by The Guardian). It's just another example of Assange's creepy Jekyll-and-Hyde persona. This isn't the first movie about Assange. There was also the forgettable 2013 fictionalized movie \"Fifth Estate\" with Benedict Cumberbatch playing Assange. That same year, we got Alex Gibney's \"We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks,\" which delves more into the Chelsea Manning chapter of the group. But \"Risk\" gives us the most unfiltered look at Assange we've seen. In the end, it shows us a complex man you'll have more questions about than answers after seeing the movie. \"Risk\" opens in theaters Friday and airs on Showtime later this year.",

    "title": "Hong Kong could become the next 'demographic time bomb'",
    "content": "Kevin Frayer/Getty Images While Japan grapples with a fertility crisis decades in the making, roughly 1,800 miles away another population is just starting to feel the squeeze. Hong Kong is quickly becoming the next demographic time bomb. Economists use \"demographic time bomb\" to refer to places where consumer spending and the national birth rate are both low. Often, they're entangled in a vicious cycle: As people feel the economy tightening, they have fewer kids, leading to even less money flowing into the economy, and so on. In Hong Kong, the government is faced with a striking gender imbalance; women outnumber men at nearly every age bracket above 25. The imbalance is mainly due to men seeking women up north, in mainland China, as the women there are commonly viewed as less choosy than in Hong Kong, according to experts in gender studies. Each year, the city also brings in thousands of foreign domestic helpers (who are almost always female) from countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The two trends have coalesced into a tense climate for younger generations. \"I am very nervous. Finding a boyfriend in Hong Kong is extremely difficult, and there is a lot of pressure,\" 26-year-old Sarah Fung told Nikkei Asian Review. As is typical with other demographic time bombs, Hong Kong's population is rapidly aging. The average life expectancies for men and women are the longest in the world: 87 years for women and 81 years for men. That means fewer people working, but more people relying on social services paid for by the young. Meanwhile, fertility rates in Hong Kong are some of the lowest in the world. According to CIA data, the estimated birth rate is just 1.19 children per woman -- far below the rate of 2.2 children that experts say countries must hit in order to keep populations steady. The combination tends to make demographic time bombs worse. As seniors require more public funds, shrinking younger generations must bear ever-rising costs. These stressors make it even harder to start or grow a family, to say nothing of the baseline difficulties posed by the gender imbalance. The challenge is so great that Paul Yip, a University of Hong Kong demographer, told the Wall Street Journal in 2012 that, according to his research, 20% of Hong Kong's female population born today should expect to remain single for the rest of their lives. Hong Kong's government has tried to stem its crisis by bringing more women into the workforce, which research suggests helps fertility rates go back on the rise. Currently, 55% of Hong Kong women are in the labor force. The global average is 63%, according to OECD data. In that respect, Hong Kong is poised to help itself out. There are 852 men for every 1,000 women, and there will likely be one million more women than men in the next 50 years. In other words, there is no shortage of women to enter the workforce. What remains to be seen is whether Hong Kong embraces that untapped pool of labor or lets the demographic time bomb keep on ticking.",

    "content": "Into the Sunset: An F-35B during tanker testing over the Patuxent river corridor in October 2015. Lockheed Martin/Michael D. Jackson Retired US Marine Corps Maj. Dan Flatley will never forget the crushing feeling of helplessness he felt the first time he faced a stealth jet while he was flying in an F/A-18. \"I remember indelibly the moment in which the AWAC (airborne early warning and control plane) called out to me that there was a Raptor [an F-22 stealth fighter] in front of me at very close range that made me uncomfortable,\" Flatley told Business Insider in a phone interview. \"I had no way of targeting him, no way of defending myself.\" Despite years of training to stay focused and level headed under the extreme pressures of air-to-air combat, a sense of dread set in. Before even seeing the F-22, Flatley had already surrendered his composure, and therefore his ability to effectively fight back. Years later, Flatley would come to pilot the F-35 and even design the curriculum for training pilots in the fifth-generation fighter, where he would tap into the crushing psychological effect of fighting a plane you can't find. While the F-35 represents the most expensive weapons system of all time, and is a frequent target of government critics who chastise the program for going over budget and schedule, Flatley says the real strength of stealth fighters doesn't show up in any budget. \"What the public doesn't realize is how dominant the difference in information is,\" said Flatley. While the F-35 performs similarly to legacy jets in some areas like speed, turning, and range, there's a huge, ever-growing information gap between what the F-35 pilot sees and what an F-18 pilot sees. The F-35 features six cameras stationed around the jet and a helmet display that allows pilots to literally look through the jet as if it wasn't there. It features the only infrared radar on a US fighter since the F-14, and uses unprecedented sensor-fusion capabilities to paint an incredibly vivid picture of its surroundings for miles out. DVIDS On top of all that, it's stealth. So while the F-35 sees everything, it's seen by almost no one. Legacy jets, with the help of AWACs \" may have a general idea that there's an F-35 out there, but they don't know exactly where we are,\" said Flatley. The distinct information disadvantage causes pilots to get tunnel vision, according to Flatley. \"Everything they see becomes the F-35 out there,\" said Flatley. \"Every radar hit, every communication is about the stealth jet. They want to illuminate or eliminate a threat they can't handle.\" The fear and paranoia caused by the presence of stealth jets in a battle has a widespread effect on adversaries that \" includes extremely capable legacy jets and certainly includes everything available to adversaries,\" said Flatley of updated F-16s, F-15s, and even enemy air defenses like Russia's S-400. Lt. Col. Benjamin Bishop completes preflight checks before his first sortie in an F-35A Lightning II, March 6, 2013, at Eglin Air Force Base. US Air Force photo Even extremely capable operators fall prey to the F-35's psychological advantage. \"It has nothing to do with their skill or technology. They're at such a technological disadvantage,\" said Flatley. \"I've seen guys in F-18s turn directly in front of me and show me their tails cause they have no idea I'm there.\" In the end, \"It aggregates to a completely inept response to what we're doing in the air,\" said Flatley. \"People are so hellbent on shooting down the stealth fighter that they invariably make mistakes that I can exploit.\"",

    "content": "Gizmodo By the slimmest of margins, cell-phone users may have cemented the death of landline phones, new data from Centers for Disease Control show. In US homes, 50.8% of people are now wireless-only, meaning they rely on a smartphone or mobile phone as their primary form of communication. The remaining 49.2% still use traditional landlines that plug into a wall. That new ratio, drawn from surveys conducted from July-December 2016, reflects a small but important change from the same period in 2015: It is the first time wireless phone use has surpassed that of landlines. The results showed that today's number of wireless-only homes is 2.5 percentage points higher than it was a year prior. The survey included 19,956 households as part of the CDC's National Health Interview Survey, which tracks how many people still use landlines in order to capture the most accurate picture of public health. \"The wireless-only population are more likely to engage in risky behaviors,\" Stephen Blumberg, an author of the report, told STAT reporter Andrew Joseph. \"They're more likely to smoke, to drink heavily, to be uninsured, to not wear seat belts. Without including them, the reported numbers of people doing those things appeared smaller than they really were.\" For instance, more than 70% of all adults 25-34 years old and who rented their homes used wireless phones only. Conducting phone surveys by calling only people with landlines would ignore that pool of respondents. According to the Associated Press, people with landlines express a variety of reasons for keeping them -- and sometimes it just comes down to what's familiar. \"My parents had landlines, as did their parents,\" Martin Axel, a retired hospital administrator in Seal Beach, California, told the AP. \"It's probably a habit. It just feels more comfortable to me.\"",

    "content": "BI IntelligenceThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here.Apple reported uninspiring FY Q2 2017 (CY Q1 2017) earnings on Tuesday largely as a result of sluggish demand for the iPhone. Global iPhone sales reached 51,000 in Q1, remaining mostly flat from the same quarter last year.This affected overall revenue for the quarter, which grew 5% year-over-year (YoY) to reach just shy of $53 billion, up from $50 billion in Q1 2016. CEO Tim Cook blamed iPhone 8 rumors for the less than stellar iPhone sales. The news was unsurprising considering that the global smartphone market has cooled over the past 12 months.Nevertheless, Services and Other Products -- Apple's peripheral segments -- are showing significant growth, offering a bright light amid the dark cloud of iPhone sales:The wearables segment -- Apple Watch, Beats, and AirPods -- is performing particularly well, according to comments made by Cook during earnings call. Although the company doesn't break out this segment by product, Cook noted that the combined 2016 revenue of Apple's wearables equates to a Fortune 500 company. Considering that Burlington Stores (No. 500 on the Fortune 500 list) generates $5.1 billion in annual revenue, it's safe to assume that Apple's total wearables likely generate at least this much on an annual basis.Apple's Q1 2017 performance suggests that the foundation the company has been laying over the past two years is finally gaining traction among consumers. With global premium smartphone shipments stagnating, Apple's ability to generate revenue outside of iPhone sales is imperative to its future bottom line. To achieve this, the company is expanding existing platforms such as its app ecosystem, creating the iMessage App Store for mini apps launched within the iMessage interface, as well as pushing further into areas like healthcare through its ancillary products, such as the Apple Watch. It's likely that these formerly peripheral segments will become increasingly important moving forward.Cloud computing -- on-demand, internet-based computing services -- has been successfully applied to many computing functions in recent years.From consumer-facing, web-based productivity apps like Google Docs to enterprise database management suites, the tools businesses rely on are increasingly moving to the cloud.But developing a cloud strategy is no easy task. Public cloud solutions will likely come to dominate the market over the next decade, but business constraints, such as security concerns and the limitations of existing infrastructure, make it difficult for companies to fully adopt the public cloud right now.That means that hybrid clouds, in which multiple cloud implementations (including public and private) are connected, will remain popular for the time being, at least until these constraints are addressed. The tech giants that dominate the IaaS market -- Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, and Google -- are constantly expanding their offerings to address current business constraints as they compete for market share.Christina Anzalone, senior research analyst at BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on cloud computing that evaluates the current business considerations for the various cloud solutions and provides an outlook on the state of the market.Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: In full, the report:Interested in getting the full report?

    "content": "Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski Neilson Barnard/Getty President Donald Trump and top adviser Jared Kushner reportedly offered to officiate \"Morning Joe\" hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski's wedding. Vanity Fair reported Thursday that according to Scarborough, the president suggested in January that the couple be married at the White House or Trump's Mar-a-Lago club. \"Jared interrupted and said, 'Hey, you know what? I've got my license. I could marry you,'\" Scarborough told Vanity Fair. \"'Why would you marry them? They could have the President of the United States marry them,'\" Scarborough said Trump interjected. Though Brzezinski dismissed the possibility of being married at the White House, it is unclear whether the offer would stand today. The once-cozy relationship between the couple and the president appears to have hit a rough patch since he took office. Both Brzezinski and Scarborough have been increasingly critical of some administration figures and policy decisions, ripping his rollout of the travel ban earlier this year, and barring one of his top advisers from the show. Brzezinski told the Los Angeles Times earlier this year that she and the president are no longer on speaking terms, which she blamed on her gender and outspoken criticism of Trump. \"He just won't even engage,\" she said. \"Joe will punch him in the face and he'll come back for more.\" The romance between the two hosts has been widely rumored for years, though they've shied away from publicly discussing it before announcing their engagement in Vanity Fair. Indeed, congratulated by Harold Ford Jr. on Thursday's \"Morning Joe,\" the two hosts blushed and pivoted to the show's ratings. \"Thank you, good good,\" Brezinski said when Ford congratulated the couple. \"Numbers have been up lately, show's going well,\" co-host Willie Geist replied. \"It is, thank you,\" Brzezinski said. \"That's it.\"",

The host wasted no time in touching on the social-media campaign using the hashtag \"#FireColbert.\" \"Welcome to 'The Late Show.' I'm your host, Stephen Colbert. Still? I am still the host? I'm still the host!\" he began Wednesday's episode. The uproar was the result of comments he made during Monday's passionate \"Late Show\" monologue, which went viral online. In it, he stood up for CBS reporter and friend John Dickerson, whose interview with Trump was cut short by the president after he was repeatedly questioned about his allegations that President Barack Obama had ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower during the campaign. Among the insults Colbert directed at Trump, he said, \"The only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin's c--k holster,\" which raised the eyebrows of many viewers. \"Now, if you saw my monologue Monday, you know that I was a little upset at Donald Trump for insulting a friend of mine,\" Colbert said on Wednesday night. \"So at the end of that monologue I had a few choice insults for the president in return. I don't regret that. He, I believe, can take care of himself. I have jokes; he has the launch codes. So it's a fair fight.\" What may have started as outrage from LGBTQ rights supporters in response to the \"c--k holster\" comment that they considered homophobic was then adopted by Trump supporters who jumped on the #FireColbert campaign in response to the entire monologue and the host's ongoing sharp criticism of the president. Colbert has faced a campaign for his termination before, during his Comedy Central days, over a joke some viewed as racist. And in light of the new Trump joke, he did want to make sure his viewers knew exactly where he stood on LGBTQ rights. \"So while I would do it again, I would change a few words that were cruder than they needed to be,\" Colbert said. \"I'm not going to repeat the phrase, but I just want to say for the record, life is short, and anyone who expresses their love for another person, in their own way, is to me, an American hero. I think we can all agree on that. I hope even the president and I can agree on that. Nothing else, but that.\" Watch Colbert address the controversial comments below:",

Here's what one of the emails looked like: BI At least hundreds of thousands of people got emails purporting to be a Google Doc shared from a contact, but it turned out to be a scam. If someone clicked on the fake Google Doc, the bug would email itself to their entire contact book. That's how it went viral. The worm ended up affecting fewer than 0.1% of Gmail users, a Google spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement on Thursday. Gmail has at least 1 billion monthly active users, so that suggests the worm could've affected as many as 1 million users. Luckily, Google says that if you clicked on the Google Doc phishing link, you don't need to do anything else right now to protect yourself. Google said it has disabled the offending worm, and I personally found that Gmail started marking the worm's emails as spam. Here's Google's full statement: \"We realize people are concerned about their Google accounts, and we're now able to give a fuller explanation after further investigation. We have taken action to protect users against an email spam campaign impersonating Google Docs, which affected fewer than 0.1% of Gmail users. We protected users from this attack through a combination of automatic and manual actions, including removing the fake pages and applications, and pushing updates through Safe Browsing, Gmail, and other anti-abuse systems. We were able to stop the campaign within approximately one hour. While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed.

    "content": "A Japanese student in a classroom from in Ofunato city, Iwate prefecture. Kyodo/Reuters In the US, dress-code violations might include an offensive t-shirt or a mini skirt. In Japan, a dye job can do you in. According to a new survey published by Tokyo news outlet The Asahi Shimbun, 57% of public high schools in the city require students to prove that their hair color is natural. The measure is designed to uphold strict Japanese standards regarding physical appearance: In addition to prohibiting students from perming or dyeing their hair, many Japanese schools mandate crisp, respectable dress and don't allow overly long or unkempt hair. According to Asahi Shimbun, 98 of the 170 schools surveyed by the paper had such a policy in place. The number of children who'd been made to prove their hair color was real ranged from a few to a few dozen during the most recent school year. \"Some students insist that their hair is natural even though it is dyed,\" one teacher told Asahi Simbun. \"We ask their parents to confirm these claims as their responsibility.\" Unlike the US, Japan's population is fairly homogeneous. As a result, the culture often places a premium on uniformity -- even slight deviations from the norm tend to stand out, and provoke criticism in more conservative circles. Natsuko Fujimaki, a Tokyo-based entrepreneur, says this is where the Japanese concept of majime comes into play. The term refers to a preference for order, tidiness, and often perfectionism. It tracks closely with a desire to stay reserved and sensible in comportment. \"They try to follow the rules for everything,\" Fujimkai tells Business Insider. In order to prove that a student's hair is natural, schools will often ask parents to submit childhood photos depicting the kid's hair color. In less extreme cases, parents only need to verify in writing (with a signature) that their child's hair hasn't been treated in any way. The practice is not new. Even a decade ago, some schools required students to prove they hadn't dyed or curled their hair. In extreme cases, schools would even require foreign-born students to dye their hair to conform to the rest of the student body as part of a forced assimilation process. \"Every week teachers would check if Nicola was dyeing her hair brown,\" a Brazilian-born student named Maria told Japan Times of her sister, Nicola, in 2007. \"Even though she said this is her natural color, she was instructed to straighten and dye it black. She did so once a week. But the ordeal traumatized her. She still has a complex about her appearance.\" Hair dye and perms aren't the only beauty choices subject to Japanese dress-code standards. Many male students can't wear spiky or messy hairstyles, allow their hair to cover their eyes, or let it grow past their collars. Some schools require female students to pin their hair back \"in a way that does not interfere with classroom instruction,\" as one school's code put it. According to Asahi Shimbun, Japan's falling birth rate plays a role in these rules. With fewer students to fill the schools, public and private schools have started competing for parents' attention. One strategy they've adopted: Highlight their strict hair policies to show how majime they are about education, in hopes parents will be impressed by the rigor. Some critics say the requirement that students prove their hair is natural violates their privacy. Meanwhile, advocates allege it does the students a favor, since one verification process can prevent headmasters from constantly asking whether a child's hair is real. They say asking for initial proof ends up sparing kids even greater psychological harm.",

Apple claims their laptop batteries can complete 1,000 full \"charge cycles\" before experiencing any degradation, but if you've been using your MacBook Air regularly, you might be noticing it already.If the only problem with your older computer is the battery, there's no reason to spend the money on a new one. Instead, you can buy a replacement battery and fix the problem yourself.I'm recommending Egoway's battery replacement pack because it's positioned as a kit; instead of just selling a battery, Egoway also includes a set of instructions and the two screwdrivers you'll need to perform the upgrade. It might not sound like a big deal, but Apple uses proprietary screws that are difficult to get out without the right tools. Performing this upgrade won't be tremendously difficult, but it will require that you take part of your computer apart. iFixit has a set of step-by-step guides for every MacBook Air battery replacement, and I cannot recommend their guides highly enough. If you're not comfortable performing this upgrade yourself, consider looking up a local computer repair shop, or asking a more tech-savvy friend. Regardless of who does the upgrade, fixing problems with your existing computer will always be a more economical choice than buying a new one. My final word of caution is that performing this upgrade will void your Applecare warranty if you have one. On the other hand, Egoway's battery comes with its own 18-month warranty, which would be a coverage improvement if you're working with an older machine that doesn't have Applecare.A full list of MacBook Air models this battery is compatible with is listed below.

    "content": "Austrian Airlines economy class. Flickr/ Austrian Airlines The middle seat -- especially in coach -- is one of the most dreaded and common scenarios in flying. It's cramped, it's inconvenient, and it's often the only seats available on flights -- particularly if you book at the last minute. In the past, an easy way to ensure you get an aisle or window seat is to book the flight early. However, airlines have figured out that their customers have an almost universal hatred for the middle seat. Not only that, airlines have come to realize that many are actually willing to pay to avoid it. For instance, Delta's cheapest tickets these days fall under its Basic Economy class which only allow passengers to select their seats after checking in -- at which point the window and aisle seats are likely to be already gone. This means passengers will have to buy more expensive main cabin tickets in order to select seats at the time of booking. On the other hand, Southwest -- which doesn't assign seats -- charges passengers $15 for the privilege of boarding early. Southwest Airlines doesn't assign seats. LM Otero/AP Although it is impossible to completely rule out the possibility of ending up in the middle seat, there are several ways to avoid it without having to pony up extra dough. First, in spite of the revenue generating fees airlines have come up with, booking early is still the best way to ensure you don't end up sandwiched in the middle. In addition to an increased likelihood of getting an aisle or window seats, booking early will also net you cheaper ticket prices. According to a study by Expedia, the average price of tickets are its lowest 57 days ahead of the flight. Further, the study also showed that those buying tickets more than three weeks in advance on flights within North America can expect to see savings of roughly 43-56%. In fact, savings from cheaper tickets prices may allow you to \"splurge\" on the fees for aisle or window seats. Boeing 737 with six-abreast seating. Boeing Second, the plane used to operate the flight makes a big difference as well. These days, the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 along with their many derivatives dominate the short-to-medium-range market. Both aircraft are generally configured with six-abreast seating or six seats per row with two sections of three seats divided by a single aisle. This results in two middle seats per row. However, there are ways to reduce the likelihood of ending up in the middle seat by taking flights using planes with fewer or no middle seats on board. Instead of the 737 and A320, look for flights operated by Bombardier C-Series, McDonnell Douglas MD80 series, MD90, and Boeing 717-200 jets. These aircraft feature five-abreast seating in a 3-2 configuration -- meaning there is only one middle seat per row. In the US, the MD and 717 aircraft are mostly operated by Delta, American, and Allegiant. However, many of these aircraft are aging and their operators are working quickly to replace them with planes that are newer and have more seats. American is in the process of replacing its MD80 or Super80 aircraft with new Boeing 737s. At the same time, Delta is beginning to retire older MD88s in favor of new Airbus A321s. With that said, Delta's fleet currently features more than 270 MD88, MD90, and 717 jets. Which means they'll be around well into the next decade. Delta Air Lines MD88. Flickr/Aero Icarus The Bombardier C-Series is brand new and just entered service with SWISS in July of 2016. Over the next few years, the Canadian jetliner will become a more common sight in airports around the world with Delta, Air Canada, SWISS, and Korean Air as its most well-known operators. Another option is to take flights operated for the major airlines by regional carriers under names such as Delta Connection, United Express, and American Eagle. These flights are generally operated using regional jets or turboprop airliners. Although they are smaller and more cramped, regional aircraft are generally setup in a 2-2 configuration which means there are no middle seats. For this, look for aircraft such as the Bombardier CRJ, the Q400 turboprop as well as the Embraer ERJ. Delta Connection CRJ regional jet. AP The Embraer E170 and E190 series is a good 'tweener option. Seating anywhere between 70 to 100 passengers, the E-Jet operates both as a regional airliner and with mainline carriers such as American, Air Canada, Polish LOT, and JetBlue. Like the smaller regional jets, the E-Jet is usually setup in a 2-2 configuration with no middle seats. With Embraer launching a second generation of the E-Jet, expect this to be an option for many years down the road. Unfortunately for many flyers around the world, the narrow-body airliner fleet in Asia and Europe is a virtual duopoly split between the 737 and the A320-family. As a result, apart from encountering the odd C-Series, E-Jet or 717, passengers will have to fly on a regional jet to avoid six-abreast seating. A JetBlue Embraer E-Jet. Flickr/Bill Abbott Choosing a flight based on the airplane also works on long-haul international flights. These flights are commonly operated by wide-body, twin-aisle airliners such as the Boeing 777, 787, and Airbus A350 as well as the larger Boeing 747 jumbos and the Airbus A380 superjumbos. These large jets are generally setup with nine or even 10-abreast seating in a 3-3-3 or 3-4-3 configuration with either three or four middle seats per row in coach. For flyers looking to avoid middle seats on long haul flights, there are several types of aircraft they should hone in on. First, Boeing's venerable twin-engine 767 wide-body is still around and can commonly be found with a 2-3-2 configuration. That means there's only one middle seat per row in coach. It should be noted, however, that many of the 767s are pushing 20 years of age and like the MD80/90, airlines are in the process of replacing them with newer models. Airbus A330neo future interior. Airbus With the 767 on the way out, look for flights operated by the twin-engine Airbus A330 and its discontinued four-engined sibling, the A340. These airliners generally feature eight-abreast seating in a 2-4-2 configuration. As a result, the A330/A340 generally fly with only two middle seats per row in coach. Fortunately, for flyers, the A330 one of the most popular wide-body airliners in the world with about 1,500 examples in operation and is still rolling off Airbus production lines. In fact, the company is currently selling a next generation version called the A330neo.",

    "content": "The BlackBerry KeyOne.Jeff Dunn/Business InsiderHere's what I think is going to happen to smartphones.Today, most name-brand smartphones look and feel about the same. The trend with the latest top-end phones is to shrink the borders around the display, but that's well on its way to being commoditized, too.But for most phone makers, the \"follow the leader\" strategy isn't working. Apple and Samsung are, for the most part, the only ones who consistently sell to a mass market. Eventually, these other companies will have to stand out or go away. If they do the former, I think we'll see a new wave of hardware that plays to specific niches. There'd be a phone for gamers, a phone for camera fiends, maybe even a modular phone. Would all of these be good? No. It's also worth noting that many companies have tried and failed on this route before. But with better tech to work with, augmented reality coming, and a much larger pool of people to sell to, it may be time to try again.All of this is a roundabout way of saying the BlackBerry KeyOne is a quality phone, but only for a very particular group of people. More specifically, the new $549 device -- which is technically built by Chinese brand TCL but uses BlackBerry's branding and software -- should align well with anyone who misses the feel of a physical keyboard. What's more, it's the only good phone for that group.For everyone else, though, it's probably overpriced.I've been using a pre-production unit of the BlackBerry KeyOne for the past two weeks -- here's what it's like:",

The move could help considerably grow Snap's fledgling ad business, which is expected to reach $1 billion in revenue this year.Releasing a self-service ads manager is intended to erase any friction that may be keeping advertisers off Snapchat, a company spokesperson told Business Insider. Snap expects larger buyers to still go through one of its auction partners, which offer more custom targeting like timing ads to run alongside TV campaigns or during specific weather conditions.Snapchat's new ads manager will let any advertiser buy, manage, and view reporting for their campaigns. All ad formats, including app install ads, sponsored geofilters, and fullscreen video, are available alongside existing targeting capabilities like goal-based bidding. The manager is free to use and requires no minimum ad spend.A new mobile dashboard will also allow marketers to see their ads like a normal user, view analytics, and get notification updates about their campaigns directly from the Snapchat app. Over 20 brands are testing these new tools now as part of a private beta, and Snap plans to make them available to everyone in June.A screenshot of Snapchat's new ads manager.Snap\"90% of the stuff we would want is all there,\" Ameesh Paleja, the CEO of mobile movie ticketing app Atom Tickets, told Business Insider in an interview. \"You don't need a lot of training to start using it.\"Atom Tickets, which is headquartered down the street from Snap in Santa Monica, California, has been testing the app's new ad manager over the past several weeks.

    "content": "Peter More, chief competition officer of EA, and Kevin Lin, COO of Twitch, at Business Insider IGNITION 2016. Business Insider The world of e-sports is massive and still growing, and advertisers are wondering how they can profit from this phenomenon. Kevin Lin, COO of Twitch, and Peter More, chief competition officer of EA, sat down with Business Insider's Steve Kovach at IGNITION 2016 to discuss the role advertisers play in e-sports. In addition to revenue sources like subscriptions, donations, sponsorships, event-based ticketing, merchandise, food and beverage, and in-game items, Lin said advertising is the main way e-sports are monetized. So why do advertisers want to get involved? For one thing, the viewership numbers are huge. \"Some of them hit tens of millions,\" Lin said. \"In concurrents, you'll see millions.\" Additionally, users spend two hours a day, on average, watching content. During competitions, the number grows to 8 to 10 hours. Another reason e-sports are intriguing to advertisers is the demographic they reach. According to Lin, 90% of the Twitch audience subscribes to Netflix or Hulu rather than traditional cable. \"Broadcasters are wondering how to reach this demographic,\" Moore said, so they want to be a part of e-sports. With millions of young people not seeing traditional advertisements, companies are recognizing the need to engage with younger audiences in other ways. But there is a challenge in this form of advertising. Because this audience is not used to traditional advertising, they are quick to recognize when something is not authentic. Moore mentioned that brands have to be careful when entering this space, and must be able to show they are truly interested in growing the field of e-sports rather than just selling a product. \"A lot of brands that are very interested in the space are building entire divisions that are hired from the community,\" Lin said. \"They can help craft a message and marketing plan that really resonates.\" When done correctly, massive success can be had. For example, Nissan launched a holiday campaign on Twitch. The Twitter impressions and chat messages involving the word \"Nissan\" were in the millions. Nissan did not expect this result, but because the campaign was authentic it succeeded. Companies have huge potential to reach a new audience by dipping into e-sports, and we will likely be seeing even more of this in the future. We're rolling out the speaker lineup over the coming months, and you won't want to miss it. Business Insider IGNITION 2017 will take place November 29-30 at the Time Warner Center in New York City.

    "title": "Google's Eric Schmidt: I'm a 'job elimination denier' on the risk of robots stealing jobs",
    "content": "Eric Schmidt, talking at MIT in May 2017.Jason Dorfman, MIT CSAILEric Schmidt, chairman of Google parent company Alphabet, isn't too worried about the prospect of robots stealing everyone's jobs.At a talk at MIT's computer science and AI lab on Wednesday, the high-profile tech executive described himself as a \"job elimination denier.\"His argument? That while some jobs are undeniably being lost to automation, more jobs will ultimately be created to replace them as a result of technological advancements.The threat that automation poses to many traditional jobs is of serious concern to many economists and social scientists. Some fear that, if left unchecked, AI and technological developments could leave many people out of work and unable to find new jobs.A recent study published by PwC estimated that as many as 38% of jobs in the US could be \"susceptible to automation by robots and AI\" by the early 2030s -- with 30% in the UK at risk, 35% in Germany, and 21% in Japan -- although it believes jobs will be created elsewhere in the economy to help offset this. And the World Economic Forum has warned that the \"fourth industrial revolution\" will cost more than 5 million jobs by 2020, just as jobs were lost as a result of automation in previous periods of rapid industrial progress.When asked about the impact of AI on jobs, Schmidt said that \"there's no question that there's job dislocation,\" but that that's not the whole story.\"The economic folks would say that you can see the job that's lost, but you very seldom can see the job that's created. Let's give an example: Let's imagine a scenario where California allows a thousand-pound truck to be driven down Highway Five with no person in it ... There's no question that driver, and this is an important job, is missing. Could there be other jobs created by virtue of the loss of that job? There could be,\" he said.\"I'm going to take the position that, because no-one really knows the answer, that this time is not different [to previous industrial revolutions], that while we have a tremendous dislocation in jobs -- I'm not denying that -- in aggregate, there will be more jobs.\"The truck Schmidt cites is an interesting example -- because Waymo, another of Alphabet's companies, is dedicated to developing self-driving cars. Its vehicles have already driven millions of miles. If successful, it could see millions of human truck drivers -- one of the most common jobs in the United States -- made obsolete.Fundamentally, Schmidt has an optimistic approach to the problem, and one that puts the emphasis on providing training and skills to the workforce so they can take advantage of new job opportunities. But the exec also acknowledged another dark facet of the internet age: Rising income inequality. \"The gap between the winners and the ... service workers is getting larger,\" he said. \"If you're in an information age, who are the winners? Well, the people who have the information.\"Sure, it looks harmless, but is it trying to steal your job?Reuters/Issei KatoOthers take a more pessimistic approach to the issue of automation than Schmidt. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gave a sober warning in December 2016: \"The fundamental challenge is that, alongside its great benefits, every technological revolution mercilessly destroys jobs and livelihoods -- and therefore identities -- well before the new ones emerge.\"He went on: \"This was true of the eclipse of agriculture and cottage industry by the industrial revolution, the displacement of manufacturing by the service economy, and now the hollowing out of many of those middle-class services jobs through machine learning and global sourcing.\"In other words: Even if new jobs are ultimately created to replace those lost, it won't be straight away -- and that could cause serious problems.Get the latest Google stock price here.",

    "title": "Ad tech is fighting the Google and Facebook duopoly",
    "content": "Fight.Mike Ehrmann/GettyAn adtech consortium including AppNexus, LiveRamp and MediaMath has today (May 4) been launched, which claims it will help advertisers better target users across screens using programmatic media buying technologies, a move that is likely to rival the digital duopoly of Facebook and Google.AppNexus, LiveRamp and MediaMath, along with Index Exchange, LiveIntent, plus Rocket Fuel, have all agreed to to create a standard framework that will enable people-based media buying for advertisers looking to utilize programmatic technologies, similar to the deterministic targeting promised by the two-biggest digital media owners Facebook and Google.The development is significant as it means that advertisers attempting to target audiences using programmatic media buying technologies outside of the 'walled gardens' of Facebook and Google will be able to do so using a standard identifier, thus increasing the efficiency of all media investment using these technologies.Such a move will likely prove media planners and buyers divesting their online media spend away from 'the duopoly' of Google and Facebook (both of whom account for 20% of all media spend), thus increasing competition in the digital media market.The current bidding process in programmatic channels relies on proprietary identifiers such as cookies - often referred to as 'deterministic targeting' - and thus often cannot translate consumer identity across buyers and sellers, or across devices, which is why Facebook and Google account for the majority of online spend, as their logged-in user data can better provide such targeting.Adding identity resolution to programmatic advertising helps marketers to deliver more relevant content and enhance the consumer experience, and this consortium promises to enable precision advertising comparable to that of Google and Facebook, and does so in a privacy-conscious manner.Brian O'Kelley, CEO of AppNexus, said: \"Today, 48% of all digital advertising dollars accrue to just two companies - Facebook and Google. \"That dynamic has placed considerable strain on the open internet companies that generate great journalism, film, music, social networking, and information.\"Travis May, president and general manager of LiveRamp, added: \"There's huge demand for leveraging a deterministic, omnichannel identifier in the bidstream, as marketers want to improve their interactions with consumers by linking data from customer files and offline channels - such as in-store purchases - to media exposure in programmatic channels. The creation of this consortium will accelerate the delivery of this value to marketers and their partners in the digital media ecosystem.\"MediaMath president Michael Lamb, added: \"The opportunity to establish the strong and consistent data protection policies that consumers deserve. Upgrading this foundational piece of the infrastructure puts us on solid footing, as programmatic grows to encompass all of digital.\"The unprecedented cooperation means participants will have access to an identity framework built from pairing an encrypted version of people-based identifiers across devices. Upon the terms of the agreement, each consortium member has agreed to adhere to an agreement with respect to privacy and security, including compliance with digital advertising industry self-regulatory code and applicable laws.This includes the ability to use adtech to target ads on: mobile; addressable TV; Internet of Things (IoT); Out-of-home (OOH); email, and emerging channels for targeted programmatic advertising.Until now, the lack of a common, omni-channel, people-based identifier has created significant challenges for marketers, including the inability to coordinate campaigns across platforms, a lack of interoperability with the mobile web, and siloing across channels.David Gosen, general manager, platform solutions and SVP, international at Rocket Fuel, said: \"This collaboration of businesses operating in the digital advertising space will contribute to more transparency and efficiency, which is great news for the internet and our industry. Vitally, it also creates greater relevance for the end consumer. At Rocket Fuel, we believe the future is about people, not devices, so partnering with others in the digital ecosystem to deliver this more widely is a positive move for all involved.\"Andrew Casale, president and chief executive of Index Exchange, said the move would bring greater transparency to the industry. He added: \"Creating an open, people-based identifier across industry leaders is a major opportunity -- this changes the programmatic landscape for the better, as it exposes unified methods of people-based buying to the open web.\"Commenting on the consensus, LiveIntent founder and chief executive Matt Keiser, also spoke of the benefit to the sell-side of the industry: \"For publishing brands, the consortium provides access to new identity-informed demand, increasing the value of their inventory. Marketers want access to their target audiences where they are spending time, irrespective of browser or device.\"Inventory sellers need to be able to provide identity resolution to buyers for targeting, measurement, and attribution. This consortium delivers what people-based marketing needs: success at the intersection of marketing and advertising.\"Get the latest Google stock price here.Read the original article on The Drum.

    "title": "Challenger bank Metro plans to invest PS55 million in tech this year",
    "content": "Metro Bank staff. Metro Bank LONDON -- Metro Bank, the challenger bank known for its bold High Street branches, is going digital. CEO Craig Donaldson told Business Insider on Thursday that the startup bank plans to invest PS55 million in technology this year. Donaldson said: \"This year we're going to spend about PS55 million on technology development and about PS35 million on store development. Stores are still a massive part of the business but for me it's about how you integrate the digital and physical together.\" Metro Bank already has a banking app for customers who have opened accounts in one of its branches but it plans to launch the ability to let new customers open their first account entirely online later this year. Donaldson said: \"In quarter three, when we launch online, you could sit in Pret, open your account on your iPad or your laptop and then pop in store and collect your card in store. No other bank can do that.\" The plans for digital investment come as Metro Bank announced on Wednesday that it has passed 1 million customers. Launched in 2010 by American entrepreneur Vernon Hill, Metro Bank was unusual in opening branches at a time when other banks were closing them at a record rate. Hill calls his customers \"fans\" and sees Metro Bank more as a retail operation than a traditional bank. Branches -- which Metro calls \"stores\" -- feature customer-friendly features such as dog bowls, free lolly pops, and longer than usual hours. The 1 millionth account was in fact opened on first May bank holiday, a day most banks were closed. Craig Donaldson, Metro Bank CEO. Metro Bank Donaldson said the digital investment \"rounds the service out\" and will help growth continue. He said: \"Customers expect now to be able to do everything on the mobile or the internet or the telephone -- and also face-to-face. \"I've no doubt we'll get to over 2 million accounts in a much faster time because of the continued growth and momentum in the business.\" As well as launching online account opening, Metro Bank will be investing in upgrading the technology in its back office. Donaldson said: \"We're doing a lot of work in the back office around machine learning to try and speed up and automate processes. We're investing a lot of money in transaction monitoring, again using machine learning and automation to drive productivity. \"My view is technology can be used throughout the process to ensure it's as slick and as quick as possible. It's no good having a great front end unless you've got that great service throughout every touch-point.\" While digital is a big focus, Metro Bank still plans to open 10 new \"stores\" by the end of the year. It hopes to have over 100 branches by 2020. This sets the bank apart from other lenders who are busily shrinking their branch networks as customers move online. Metro Bank's headquarters in Holborn, London. Metro Bank Donaldson says he doesn't think Metro Bank's branch network will become redundant as more people go digital. He said: \"I look at Holborn where one of our stores is today. That is an unbelievably busy corner. There's a tube station opposite and over 37 million people came out of that tube station last year. Do I believe our footfall around that store will ever drop? No, I honestly don't. I think we are fine. \"We don't have 2,000 stores with half the stores in the wrong part of town because the town centres have moved. We're not facing into that. We'll always be in strong corners with strong anchor tenants around them.\" Metro Bank turned its first quarterly profit last year and is hoping 2017 will be its first year of profitability. Donaldson said: \"My view is we've hit a point now where we can be profitable and continue to invest for growth.\" Donaldson says he is inspired not by other banks but by retailers like Lush and John Lewis. But he said: \"It's interesting looking at some banks opening hours post-us opening -- they've changed. It's interesting looking at some of the things they're doing in stores. I definitely think some banks have changed some things and made it better for customers because of what we've done. I think that's a good thing. We need more competition.\" He added: \"We need to break the oligopoly that controls banking and have underinvested in service for customers for too long. The better competition we can bring, the more other banks have to react and up their game. Everybody wins when that happens.\"",

Ve Interactive Ve Interactive, once considered a UK tech \"unicorn\" worth at least PS1 billion, was sold to its management for just PS2 million, according to an update from one of its investors. Media and tech investor Concha, which paid PS4 million for a 0.43% stake in Ve Interactive last March, issued an update to its shareholders where it said its board was \"deeply disappointed\" by the company's decline in recent months. It said the value of its investment in Ve Interactive had been \"eliminated.\" Concha wrote in its update: \"[As] part of a pre-packaged arrangement, the business and assets of Ve were sold to Rowchester Limited for a cash consideration of PS2m, payable in instalments over a 12 month period ending April 2018.\" Concha has previously said it and other shareholders were considering a challenge to the deal. In its update, the company added that it would \"continue to investigate the actions of those responsible for its demise.\" Ve Interactive is an online ad business that was once billed as a successful UK startup, but went into administration last month after failing to raise PS20 million in new funding. Its founding CEO David Brown stepped down in March, and the company went into administration in April. Its core business was rescued by its management team in a pre-pack administration deal, leaving appointed administrators Smith & Williamson to find a way to pay off Ve's creditors. The buyout was led by a consortium called Rowchester Limited, which is made up of Ve Interactive's new management team. That includes new CEO Martin Tonnessn and COO David Marrinan-Hayes. The Telegraph reported last month that Ve Interactive owed PS1.3 million in tax before its collapse.",

    "content": "MicrosoftLONDON -- On Tuesday, Microsoft announced two big new products: Windows 10 S, and the Surface Laptop.The former is a slimmed-down version of the Windows operating system (OS), while the latter is a light, portable computer that runs it.In other words, it sounds a lot like a Chromebook -- the popular laptops from Google that that run Chrome OS and have proved a smash hit in schools. Chromebooks make up 58% of all sales in US primary and secondary schools, according to one estimate.But Google says it's not too fussed with the competition -- arguing that the Surface Laptop just proves it's onto something big.On Wednesday, Business Insider sat down with Prabhakar Raghavan, the Google vice-president responsible for G Suite -- Google's range of productivity apps like Docs and Pages -- at the Google Cloud Next conference in London. When he saw the announcement, what was his reaction to Microsoft muscling in on Google's turf in the education sphere?\"I'm happy to see a validation of the approach we've taken,\" the exec said mildly. \"What educational institutions have demanded is simplicity. It's a real test tube for all of us, whether it's Microsoft or any of us, right.\"He went on: \"Because kids do things in amazing ways where you or I would never expect. So here's one of the things we've learned in a study of kids as we were developing all our tools for classrooms, right. We would put a Chromebook in front of a kid, they would whip out their phone and write their essay. We said 'no no no, there's a keyboard there, you can use it,' and they still write the essay there. They said 'we'll use the keyboard to touch up the formatting, but it'll be much faster here,' right. This is something we consistently learned when we looked at pre-teens ... these kids are really forerunners, the vanguards of human evolution, in some sense, and so it's great to see that some of the approaches we've taken, but I think the world is going to keep evolving and it's a scramble for us to keep up with what people are going to do.\"Prabhakar Raghavan, Google vice-president for G Suite, Google Cloud.Rob Price/BIIn short: Google says it's not worried about Microsoft's entry into the market, and they're focusing on looking at the changing ways people use products.Laptops from Microsoft hardware partners running Windows 10 S, which only allows apps on the Windows app store, start at $189. Meanwhile, Chromebooks can sell for as little as $149, in roughly the same budget price range.The Surface Laptop, meanwhile, is quite a bit more pricey. It goes for $999 and up, acting as a kind of flagship for the possibilities of Windows 10 S devices.\"The success of the Chromebook has awakened sleeping giants,\" Tyler Bosmeny, CEO of education tech company Clever, told Reuters. \"There's so much investment into the space -- it's unlike anything I've ever seen.\"So even if Google claims not to be worried, Microsoft clearly thinks it's in with a shot.Get the latest Google stock price here.",

A spokeswoman for Imagination told Business Insider that this essentially means the two companies will aim to reach a new agreement within the terms of the existing contract. She added that it was not a legal process. Imagination also announced on Thursday that it intends to sell two of its three core business units in a bid to strengthen the company's balance sheet.\"Imagination Technologies has commenced a dispute resolution procedure with Apple Inc. (\"Apple\") and announces that it intends to sell its MIPS and Ensigma businesses,\" the company wrote in a trading update for the year to 30 April 2017.It added: \"While the Group has continued to invest in its MIPS and Ensigma businesses, it has now decided to actively market these businesses for sale, concentrate its resources on PowerVR and strengthen Imagination's balance sheet.\"Let's take a look at each of those businesses, which are essentially Imagination's main product categories:The MIPS and Ensigma product lines accounted for PS21 million of Imagination's PS73.5 million in total revenue in the six months to October 31, The Telegraph reports.Last month, Imagination said it didn't know how Apple will make devices in the future without violating intellectual property laws.\"Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination's technology, without violating Imagination's patents, intellectual property, and confidential information,\" the company said. \"This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it.\"In the update provided on Thursday, Imagination said:\"Imagination has been unable to make satisfactory progress with Apple to date regarding alternative commercial arrangements for the current licence and royalty agreement. Imagination has therefore commenced the dispute resolution procedure under the licence agreement with a view to reaching an agreement through a more structured process. Imagination has reserved all its rights in respect of Apple's unauthorised use of Imagination's confidential information and Imagination's intellectual property rights.\"Imagination's partnership with Apple goes back nearly 10 years.

Rumph added that the breakup was likely to dent Imagination's profits by PS65 million a year.",

    "title": "Anti-gentrification campaigners are unhappy about Google's plan to open a startup 'Campus' for entrepreneurs in Berlin",
    "content": "Umspannwerk.Business Insider/Sam SheadBERLIN -- It looks like Google may have a fight on its hands in Berlin.The search giant wants to open a new startup hub in the city's Kreuzberg neighbourhood but locals are concerned about gentrification of the area.Kreuzberg has a reputation for being one of Berlin's edgiest districts; it's full of punks, anti-fascists, and other lefty-types. The neighbourhood is widely perceived as being \"cool,\" which means that some of the world's biggest companies want to be based there, including Google, whose market cap of around $640 billion (PS495 billion) makes it one of the most valuable companies in the world.Google, which already has an office in Berlin's upmarket Mitte district, first announced it wanted to open up a space in Kreuzberg last November when it unveiled plans for a new 2,400 square metre startup \"Campus\" that would open in autumn 2017. That date has now been pushed back to the end of the year.Mary Grove, director of Google for entrepreneurs and campus, wrote in a blog post: \"Our goal for Campus Berlin is to support the existing startup ecosystem even more and to promote entrepreneurship.\"Google wants to rent around a quarter of a former electricity substation called Umspannwerk that was built around the 1920s for its Campus space. Today, Umspannwerk is primarily used as an event space but it is also home to around a dozen companies and a restaurant called The Volt. No more than 10 Google employees will be based at Campus Berlin but dozens of startups will be able to use space.But residents in the area are concerned that Google's presence will damage the area's vibe and drive up rents as entrepreneurs backed by investor's millions rush to move in. Anti-gentrification protestors in Berlin deliberately marched past Umspannwerk on May Day, which occurred on Monday.\"While I see the concept of the Google Campus being a good asset to the city, I find it to be rather out of place in Kreuzberg,\" Jazmin Medrano, a life coach and a startup cofounder, told Business Insider. \"Yes, gentrification is part of Berlin, but Google coming in to the heart of Kreuzberg is like a conservative, right-winged, homophobic person going to Kit Kat Club. It makes no sense.\"Medrano added: \"Google has a bigger social responsibility to consciously think out where it's wanted, where it's not, and its implications. The cool factor to Kreuzberg is that it's alternative, somewhat dodgy, mysterious, raw, and still a bit unadulterated. Hence it being seen as cool, hip, and vibrant. And I'm sure Google wants to be in the mix of a hip scene. But what Google doesn't realise is that its mere presence will alter the cool factor, the makeup of Kreuzberg. And I think that is what most people fear.\"UmspannwerkBusiness Insider/Sam SheadNgoc Duong, co-owner of Katie's Blue Cat coffee shop, situated less than 100m from Umspannwerk, told Business Insider that she is concerned many of her staff will be priced out of properties in the area if rents go up any more. Fortunately for Duong, she's been in Berlin for 17 years and she's on one of the city's highly sought after old rental contracts -- Berlin property laws prevent landlords from increasing rents without making significant changes to the building first.While Campus clearly has its sceptics, not everyone thinks Google moving to the area is all that bad.Niklas Lechner, founder of Berlin fintech firm Innolend, told Business Insider: \"From a company/startup point of view, I think it's great to have a Google Campus within your city/district. Besides attracting new talents and companies, it will also be a great source of inspiration having them here and good for the overall vibe and ecosystem in general.\"However, I can also understand other local residents who are concerned about increasing rents, noise and especially the influence this might have on the overall culture, since I am also living 50 meters from here. We've moved here because I don't want to run into startup people every day, especially on weekends.\"Google execs announce Campus Berlin.GoogleLast week, Green Party councillor Julian Schwarze reportedly told the Neues Deutschland newspaper that the initial construction plans for Campus had been sent back to Google because of noise concerns from local residents and because \"the planned installation of an additional story in the historical building would also exceed the designated floor-area size for the district.\"Google downplayed the remarks and said Campus hadn't been \"rejected\" as several media reports (including Business Insider) suggested, adding that it was perfectly normal for changes to be made during the planning process.However, the search giant admitted that Campus Berlin may open \"a few weeks\" behind schedule but insisted that it will be open by the end of 2017.Ralf Bremer, a spokesperson for Google, told Business Insider: \"We are excited to house Campus Berlin in the [substation]. As with every rebuilding of historical sites there are tasks that we solve together with the authorities. We build out our space for local community and local entrepreneurs, and are thus working closely with the city to not only preserve, but highlight, the historic features of the building.\"Bremmer did not specify what the next step was for Google in the planning process of Campus Berlin.Google already has six Campus buildings in cities around the world, with the others in London, Tel Aviv, Seoul, Warsaw, Sao Paulo, and Madrid. The Campus spaces are designed to help entrepreneurs to form and build their businesses alongside other founders that are doing the same thing. Google claims that startups in its Campuses have raised over EUR260 million (PS220 million) and created more than 4,600 new jobs.\"We ourselves began in a garage nearly two decades ago and today we celebrate our entrepreneurial roots,\" Google writes on the Campus website. \"Google for Entrepreneurs partners with startup communities and builds Campuses where entrepreneurs can learn, connect, and create companies that will change the world.\"Since 2011, we've launched Campuses and formed partnerships that support entrepreneurs across 125 countries.\"Google isn't the only tech giant looking to move into Berlin's now-trendy old buildings. Elsewhere in the city, homegrown tech giant Zalando has recently opened a clothing store in a building on the River Spree dating back to a similar period.Get the latest Google stock price here.",

    "content": "Saturn's polar vortex as seen by NASA's Cassini spacecraft on April 26, 2017. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SSI/Kevin M. Gill; Flickr (CC BY 2.0) In late April, NASA's Cassini spacecraft began a series of potentially dangerous dives, or \"ring crossings,\" between Saturn and its innermost rings of ice. Many of the new images it beamed back looked small, drab, and grainy, yet they represented the closest-ever views of Saturn's stormy cloud tops. \"Shortly after images started arriving, some of Cassini's scientists said they were seeing 'some stuff' they'd never seen before,\" Jo Pitesky, a project science engineer for Cassini at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), previously told Business Insider in an email. \"After almost thirteen years in orbit, Saturn continues to amaze and astound us.\" Now the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has released a brand-new video that shows exactly where, when, and how the spacecraft filmed the unprecedented string of images during its \"first fantastic dive\". One view in the new animation follows the Cassini spacecraft, showing where its camera was pointed during the first hour of its dive between Saturn and the planet's rings: During the last moments, you can see the robot flip itself to deflect any wandering (and dangerous) bits of Saturn's rings. \"In the half-hour or so along the closest point of the flyby, we're pointing the high-gain antenna down, like a giant shield, to protect the instruments behind it,\" Linda Spilker, a Cassini project scientist and a planetary scientist at NASA's JPL, previously told Business Insider. \"We call this position 'shield to ram.'\" A similar view zooms out from the gas giant, showing Cassini as a red dot that traces from north to south: The clip cuts off shortly before the robot plunges through the void, since it was moving more than 76,800 mph -- 45 times faster than a speeding bullet -- and couldn't take clear photos fast enough. An illustration of the Cassini spacecraft over Saturn's north pole with its hexagon-shaped storm. NASA/JPL-Caltech The new images are just a taste of the data that NASA has scooped up (and will continue to get) by flying its $3.26 billion mission into uncharted territory. Called the \"Grand Finale,\" the goal is to squeeze as many discoveries as possible out of 22 extremely close and unprecedented flybys of Saturn and its rings. The first, which generated the movies above, occurred on April 26. Preston Dyches, a spokesperson for NASA JPL, said Cassini might have been able to get larger, more detailed images, but the team opted for lower quality on purpose. \"This is a mode in which the camera cuts down the image size by half in order to take images faster,\" Dyches previously told Business Insider in an email, adding that color likely won't come to these first images. \"It's a trade off you make in order to capture something very close moving very quickly beneath you.\" A second ring crossing happened on May 2, but NASA began downloading the images on May 3. The 22nd and final orbit will destroy the nuclear-powered probe, burning it up in the clouds of Saturn on September 15, 2017. This death is by design: The probe is low on propellant, and NASA doesn't want it to crash into -- and possibly contaminate -- Enceladus and Titan, two icy moons of Saturn that may hide oceans with conditions that could foster alien life.

Currently, the vast majority of Apple products are assembled in Asia. Apple isn't going to build iPhones stateside, but on Wednesday CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple plans to create a $1 billion fund to support advanced manufacturing in the united states. \"We asked ourselves, 'How can we get more people to do advanced manufacturing in the United States?'
