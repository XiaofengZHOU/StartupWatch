The D.C. and Miami meetups are just on the horizon, and it's about time that we introduce you to the companies presenting their products in the rapid-fire pitch-off. We'll be visiting D.C. on the evening of February 21 and then heading to Miami for a meetup on February 23. At each event, ten companies will have exactly 60 seconds to pitch their wares to the audience and a panel of expert judges, including local VCs and TechCrunch editors. So now, without any further ado, it's my pleasure to announce the awesome startups that will be gracing our stage: But even if you're not on these lists, you'll still have a shot to hop on stage and pitch your product. At each event, we're raffling off one spot in the pitch-off to our WILDCARD startup. In other words, you should probably buy tickets now. Buy tickets to the Washington D.C. meetup on February 21 right here. Buy tickets to the Miami meetup on February 23 right here. Can't wait to see you there! Sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.
