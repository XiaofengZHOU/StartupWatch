In preparation for Disrupt New York and our upcoming TC Sessions series on Robotics Matt Burns and I will be heading to Pittsburgh to talk to some startups. We have some good news! We've found a space. We will meet at the Shop on April 11 at 7pm, a new place near bakery square. Please RSVP ASAP. We also need lots and lots of startups, preferably in hardware. Startups will have two minutes to pitch and two minutes of questioning from a set of amazing judges (to be named.) We're gathering some booze and food sponsors as we speak so you'll be well-fed. Thanks to Kit Mueller and The Shop for the help so far. If you'd like to pitch at our Pitch-Off please sign up here. See yinz soon!
