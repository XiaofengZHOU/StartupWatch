The biggest tech trade show in the world is off and running, and TechCrunch has descended on Las Vegas to bring the show to you live. Some of us will be roaming the show floor live, while others will be back at the TC Booth conducting live interviews with some of hardware's biggest names, including GoPro's Nick Woodman, Dan Gilbert (founder of Quicken Loans and Detroit Venture Partners), and LEGO's Julie Goldin. Plus, we'll be hosting the much-anticipated Hardware Battlefield, where 11 hardware startups will pitch their wares to a panel of expert judges. We're bringing the whole thing to you live right here, so sit back, relax, and enjoy the show!
