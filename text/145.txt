The entrepreneurs in the Techstars NYC program are going to spend today meeting with investors, reporters and other folks from the tech industry -- but luckily, I had a chance to do rapid-fire interviews with most of them on Tuesday.Though Techstars may be increasingly known for the industry-focused startup accelerators it creates with companies like Comcast and Target, it still runs broader "city programs" -- including Techstars NYC, which this winter included startups working on everything from display technology to disappearing tattoos.Ten-minute interviews aren't exactly enough time to make me an expert in any of these subject areas, but they do provide a little more opportunity for in-depth discussion than a quick on-stage presentation (uh, not that we have anything against those). Here's an alphabetical rundown of the companies I talked to and what I learned about them.
