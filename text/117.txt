Welcome back to another episode of Equity, TechCrunch's weekly podcast that works to put the 'fun' in 'venture capital.' This week from our SoMa studio, Katie Roof, Matthew Lynley and Alex Wilhelm were joined by Sequoia's Roelof Botha. Sequoia, as you might know, was an early backer of companies like Google and Apple.

 Alex Wilhelm is the editor-in-chief of Crunchbase News and co-host of Equity, TechCrunch's venture capital-focused podcast. Celebrating the continuing earnings fete thrown by various public tech companies, we dug into Tesla's results and ensuing (modest) correction, Facebook's big quarter and its rivalry with Snap, Square's own financial tally, and recent IPOs Cloudera -- which after its conservative pricing has had a solid run -- and Carvana, which has mostly fallen apart since its debut. Perhaps we could invent a Lemon Law for car startups. Regardless, Equity drops every Friday at 6:00 am PT, so subscribe to us on iTunes, Overcast, Pocketcast, Downcast and all the casts.
