Tonight is the night! The Miami Meetup + Pitch-off kicks off at 6pm and this is your last chance to get in on the fun! If you have no idea what I'm talking about, then please let me explain: The Meetup + Pitch-off is a regional event we hold to get to know the local community. As part of the program, we'll be joined on stage by ten startups. Each of these startups will have exactly 60 seconds to pitch their wares to a panel of esteemed judges, including local VCs and TC Editors. The first place winner will win a table in the Startup Alley at the upcoming TC Disrupt NY in May. Second place will get two tickets to the conference, and the Audience Choice winner will get one ticket to the show. But wait! There's more! We will also be drawing business cards from a hat to include one extra startup in the pitch-off as a WILDCARD! So even if you weren't pre-selected to participate in the pitch-off, you still have the chance to win and get some extra publicity for your product. But the only way to do that is to buy tickets! Right here! If you want to see a list of startups presenting tonight, you can find those here. And here is the info about our esteemed judges. Can't wait to see you tonight!
