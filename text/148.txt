Monzo, one of a number of so-called "challenger" banks in the U.K. aiming to re-invent the current account, has had the "restrictions" on its banking license lifted and says it will begin rolling out full current accounts to its pre-paid card and beta app users.Whist this might seem like a regulatory technicality, it's a significant milestone for the young London-based startup and means U.K. regulators are confident Monzo has the required technology infrastructure and capital required to begin looking after customer deposits on a much-wider and protected scale.This can also include being able to lend those deposits out at some point in the future, which, like rival Starling and traditional banks, forms the basis of the company's initial business model.That Monzo has met the regulator's capital requirements is no surprise. The U.K. challenger bank recently announced the close of its latest crowdfunding round, which attracted more than PS12 million in pledges and formed part of its Series C funding round of PS22 million.

And of course you can expect Monzo's innovative functionality, such as budgeting and bill splitting, real-time alerts of transactions, geotagged transactions, and a lot more.You can listen to my interview with Monzo co-founder and CEO Tom Blomfield recorded in late February below:
